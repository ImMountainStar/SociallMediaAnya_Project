Handles well and is tight. The 2.5 I4 engine has plenty of zip. I would like a little more leg room up front, I have long legs, but I am doing OK with it. It's a very solid vehicle.

"Suquit Toyoda, 03/13/20202010ToyotaRAV4Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl 5A)","This car has a recall that effectively permanently disables the rear toe alignment adjustment by coating it in epoxy.  

This results in increased wear and tear on the suspension and tires, and if you require alignment, the cost to replace both lower forward control arms which can be more that $600.  A tidy profit for Toyota and Toyota dealers.

I'd stay away from this vehicle, and from Toyota, who thinks that it's an acceptable practice to pass on the costs of their engineering failures to the consumer years after the purchase.",1 out of 5 stars

I love the RAV 4. This is the 4th 2010 model i will be driving for so many reasons. I have never driven the V6 Limited option so i decided to get one. This is putting it mildly - This RAV4 is a Fuel Drunkard! 

It does Avg of 10.9 MPG and i don't understand how this is possible. My Ford Edge 2013 Limited 3.7L V6 does 19/20MPG while my 2014 Venza V6 does 22/24MPG. 

Previous RAV4s did about 23/24 MPG and never felt the pain in my Gas Budget. Please i need help urgently. What could be the issue? Various checks have been made on the Vehicle and no issue found. 

Please HELP as i am about to go crazy. Thanks.",2 out of 5 stars

Where is that Toyota will last  - last - last to 200K+ miles - they don't die.  NOT TRUE   quite disappointed - I have to pay $5000 to replace an old engine they found with 2 years warranty.  SAD
Yeah, update - the replaced old engine is working,  but I hesitate to drive Rav4 for a long distant.  I will continue to keep up the maintenance.  will see.",3 out of 5 stars

It's not the most comfortable car in the world, but it is practical and goes great in the snow.  The seats are not comfortable at all and if you are over 6', this vehicle isn't for you.  Other than that, no real complaints. I have a Limited model with leather and all the bells and whistles.  It doesn't look the fanciest, but everything works as should.  22-29 MPG.

"Ed, 01/21/2017updated01/07/20192010ToyotaRAV44dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl 5A)","Thought I would share my experiences in case someone is looking for a nice used vehicle. I've owned my Rav since it was brand new(2010). Very reliable vehicle. Have had next to zero issues except recalls which cost nothing except a little time. The V6 engine is probably the strongest part of the car. Tremendous acceleration, smooth, and avg. 22 mpg. I'm still on my original brake pads and I'm at 50,000 miles. The cargo space is deceivingly big inside. Mine has the spare tire on the rear gate, but that is actually an advantage because it opens up a lot of underneath storage inside the cargo area. The few downsides would be that the rear seats are a little hard (but they do have plenty of room and they recline), the steering is a little numb on center, and their is torque steer if you gun it from a standstill (and I have 4wd). But the engine is so powerful there is no need to gun it. The 4wd drive is very good and includes a lock feature for really slippery conditions. Because it's a 2010 it doesn't have all the latest technology, but if you're looking for a dependable car that's fairly comfortable with a lot of room and a great engine, you'll be happy. In a few years I plan to give this car to my daughter for her first car.
UPDATE-Jan. 2019
Still loving the reliability. Ready to hand this over to my daughter with no reservations. Still on the original brake pads at 59,000 miles. These new turbo 4 cylinder engines can't touch the smoothness, the power, and reliability of this 6 cylinder engine.",5 out of 5 stars

So, we looked for another RAV4 with the same style.  Found 2010 LIMITED V6 4WD (love the V6 power) with only 20,000 miles.  This is better because it has backup camera and smart key--love that feature.    We are going to use this car for many many miles and long long years.  Best SUV we ever had.

"RSC, 10/10/20162010ToyotaRAV44dr SUV 4WD (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","With nearly 84,000 miles, I have very little trouble with this car.  The trouble is in the form of a few recalls.  I have looked at newer RAVs and still prefer my old one as Toyota has removed some convenience items such as a double glove box (the new RAV has only an opening at the top where the old second glove box was), the sunglass holder above the windshield (I like having a place to put those), and a covered middle console (it is now open).  Cutting corners like that will not necessarily make me a repeat customer if I can find another car I like as well.  If Toyota would return some of the convenience items, I for sure will be buying another RAV.  It also handles very well in snow (a big necessity in Minnesota).  My main focus when I buy a car is how comfortable the seat is for me (I am 5'2"" and the seat makes or breaks the car for me).  My RAV fits that bill and I like the fold-down seats and huge hauling capacity in the back.  My only real complaint is the noise level in the car.  There seems to be a lot of wind noise which results in my having to turn up and down the radio/CD player.  Other than that I am a huge fan of this car.",5 out of 5 stars

Interior is overall great, seats are comfortable, equipment on limited is generous. Trunk is very spacious and practical. 

I purchased it on 43000km, now at 100000km. I've had a few surprising bills on it, specifically 3 shocks, a wheel bearing and a sticking parking brake cable, as well as a loose cable to the backup camera and an occasional glitch where a random radio button doesn't work.

The ride is at best acceptable but not as smooth as I'd hoped, I put the softest tires on possible which has helped too (the Toyo a20's were not good)

This will be my one and only RAV4, the thought of downgrading to a 4Cyl from the V6 is not appealing so when this needs to be replaced I'll get something else.",4 out of 5 stars

We drove in from Kentucky to visit with family, and to buy a car for a better value. We had looked at our Capital One email who referred us to classic Toyota in Waukegan. Once at the dealer we were met by Diana Romero who was our sales and leasing associate. Diana was friendly, knowledgeable, and she offered us coffee, snacks, and just had a wonderful personality. Diana gave us back our faith in car dealerships because of previous experiences we had vowed never to go to a dealership and purchase a car. We told Diana our monthly price range and she was able to stay within a close proximity to what we wanted, and she was very honest from the beginning about what Toyota financing could offer.

PROS:
The V6 has lots of power and better gas mileage than my last car (a Mercedes C300) and I love that the Rav uses regular grade gas.
Lots of cargo space, roomy back seat, and the radio's aux is great for using Pandora on my iPhone.
Nav and back-up camera are great features!


CONS: Hands free phone system's mic is poor quality.
Braking is a little slower than I'm used to.
Cup holder insert is too small for a travel cup and without the insert, it's too big.
Not a big deal, but a little frustrating.

I bought a 2007 RAV4 with the V6. It had greater usable cargo space and the V6 got 22mpg when the 2 CRV's never got over 21mpg with a 4 cyl.
The 2007 RAV4 got totaled in an accident, so since I was very happy with it, I bought another identical V6 4x4 base model. I bought it with a Toyota trailer hitch and I have no problem towing a 8x5 Big Tex trailer loaded with a John Deere 2320 tractor plus 3 Labs in the back cargo area in 3 large dog kennels every week 80 miles to a farm I own in the next county over.

The v6 engine is amazing, super fast and can pass anyone. The JBL stereo system is awesome. The bluetooth works good. The rav4 doesn't like corners and takes longer to break then most small suv's.

I needed a reliable, roomy SUV quickly for a long road trip.
I love to drive.
Fully loaded with stuff, using a/c, 28mpg highway (despite only 4 gears, a happy surprise).
Totally reliable, lots of storage room, side swinging rear door ok, full size spare tire a godsend.
Grossly uncomfortable driving position for this 6'2"" 210lb male, no lumbar support, my knees rubbed against console and window controls.
The worst was the loud, arthritic creaking from all the RAV4's body joints on launches, turns and stops!

I happened upon the RAV4 in the same lot. I really liked how spacious the leg room was in the second row and I really liked the back storage. I am 5'2"" so the cargo door is a plus because I had to be on my toes with the van hatchback.The full sized spare tire is also a plus; I read some neg reviews about its location but I think it's much easier access.

From the outside the Sport package is quite handsome and aggressive. I don't even mind the tire on the door. Then you get in and drive it. The 4 cyl/4 speed gets the job done, but there is no joy. The handling is good for a Sport Ute but can be jarring and at times uncomfortable particularly on long trips. Tight cabin for a 6' tall guy. Interior bits are cheap.

At the price point of the Base Rav4, I feel I got a reliable vehicle with lots of great features for my money.  Really like the side opening rear door, full size spare tire on the back, ease and location of controls, nice radio with XM Satellite, attractive exterior and lots of cargo space.  Also, quiet motor, no road noise and a smooth ride.  I have the extra value package which was worth every penny.  My Rav4 is a blast to drive and so far is trouble free.

Ride is smooth enough and all these things I read on reviews about vibrating and stuff, never experienced it except when I'm driving on  rough roads and unpaved ones, quite expected I would think. My car is the limited model and the convenience of the features really fits me well. The only thing I don't like about my car is how much I paid for it. Gas mileage is very reasonable since I'm primarily the only passenger plus my little dog, we're so happy to go out of town occasionally on weekends with comfort.

So when I purchased the Rav 4 I was confident that it would be extremely reliable. I’ve read about the excessive oil burning of the 2.4, but this is the 2.5. It was supposed to be the improved engine. I’ve had it for a year and have put so much oil into this thing. The records show on car fax that the oil was changed regularly by a dealership from previous owner. I add a quart and a half of oil every 350 miles. No engine lights and it hasn’t left me stranded, but it is very frustrating and expensive. I’m changing spark plugs regularly as well. They get fouled up with all of the excessive blow by from oil burn. I love the way it handles in snow. It’s great for that, but my next purchase will more than likely be a Honda.",3 out of 5 stars

"J HEIDNER, 09/09/20182011ToyotaRAV44dr SUV 4WD (2.5L 4cyl 4A)",Quality is synonymous with Toyota and the RAV 4 is a prime example.  I  had no maintenance issues in the 4 years I owned the RAV4.  This vehicle had great storage space with nooks and crannies everywhere.  Especially useful was the concealed area which other vehicles use to store the spare tire.  I didn't realize how much space I was using until I moved everything to another similar sized SUV.  It didn't fit and I am still frustrated by this.  I loved the moon/sun roof.   The only negative was handling in the winter ice and turning.

My girlfriend and I purchased the Rav to replace her 2003 Ford Escape. I drive the Rav 30% of the time and after two years,  there are a few things I have found annoying.  The front seats are as comfortable as bar stools.  There isn't a lot of adjustment for the driver, and none for the passenger.  I'm 6' 1"" - even with the seat all the way back and the thigh support tilted down, I don't have enough room.  We still own the Escape and when we swap back and forth between vehicles, the lack of room and comfort for the front passengers in the Rav is evident. The driver's door and steering wheel controls are not lit.  Why are the foot wells constantly lit, but they couldn't have the window and door lock buttons lit?  We have the limited model which comes with the push button start.  With this option you can't have the stereo on unless the engine is on.

Decided to replace my old car with a loaded used Rav4 as my wife's car is another sedan (2009 Camry Hybrid) Bought this cream-puff Jan 2016 which oddly was traded in on a new Caddy. One owner, no accidents, well maintained etc with 22k and excellent condition. Have had it for 4 months now and it's everything I had hoped. Got a chance to drive in snow including up a steep hill and it was almost boring how well it gripped even on original OEM tires. Overall just a far smoother ride and better built than a new 2015 and 2016 I had tried. The power is more than adequate and smooth with good handling. A highway trip in heavy rain <>70 mph gave 28 mpg. Running errands in suburbia and commute yields 23-24 mpg. Not bad for what this thing can haul inside and yet still be easy to drive and park. The JBL system sounds decent with FM but awesome with CD or iPod playing. It's not an exciting vehicle to drive but it is very comfortable and pleasant. I'm surprised to read of others with squeaks/rattles as mine has none thankfully as I can't stand that.

We are now closing on 60k miles and so far we have only had to replace the Stock tires at 30k miles - which was the only bad thing we thought. Other than that we have stuck to a good 6-7k maintenance schedule and haven't had any problems with it. Some cabin noises such as squeaks and the brakes groan a bit.. but apart from that it does what it is built for. The V6 has amazing passing power and can really get off the line pretty quick. I have put the care through the paces and it hasn't let me down so far.

It has great acceleration but am very disappointed with the gas mileage for this vehicle.  It seems to be on the low end of 22mpg and with a small gas tank seem to be at the gas station twice a week for a fill up.  What is even more depressing is the floor carpet in the interior.  On the drivers side the carpet is already torn by the left foot rest.  I never expected that for an owner who takes the best care of a vehicle.

"Michael Hoffman, 07/26/20152011ToyotaRAV44dr SUV 4WD (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","Here's the thing with Toyota.  It's ALWAYS been their thing.  Unless you upgrade to ""Limited"" (or in the old days LE, etc) - you get the cheapest stuff around as far as fit and finish of the interior.  Time was, under the hood all things were equal.  Not anymore.  Anyone who owns the BASE MODEL 4cyl 4WD MUST know how much of a lag there is if you need quick acceleration.  This thing is THE slowest responding dog I've ever driven.  Off the line, it's okay but if you need a passing gear, wow, it's bad.  This is directly the result of Toyota keeping selling costs down but it completely sacrifices the performance not having at least a 5 speed transmission.  I had a 2008 Corolla S before this which had better acceleration.  Thankfully, if you switch the shifter to 'sport' it downshifts more rapidly.  Traction control and safety features are great on this car.  The standard headlights are pathetic.  No fog lights standard either.  I've upgraded to better lights and also have installed foggers.  Makes a major difference.  The wheels are simply painted steel which I was fine with until three years in, they are already rusting.  Again - irritating.  OEM tires (Kumho) were also pure junk.  Finally, the stereo.  Now, I didn't expect a massive sound system but again - always with Toyota - it's not a Limited so they install something you would have found in an American car from 15 years ago.  Piece of absolute junk.  There are component speakers in the front doors and ONE WAY speakers in the back.  The sound in the rear is just terrible.  I've upgraded the rears and it made a good improvement.  A compass on the rearview mirror also would have been handy.  Don't get me wrong, I DO like this SUV.  Overall, I'm picky but those are the things for me that stick out.  It rides smooth, it's ultra reliable, it's quiet, very good in poor driving conditions, love the swinging rear door, plenty of room, AC blows SO COLD, lots of storage.  For those complaining of the cup holders, take the rubber insert out.  Simple.  Those were only there so one COULD use a can if you wanted to.  Also, like that it came standard with electronic fuel economy readings.  We have been driving Toyotas in my family since we owned a 1979 Supra.  Amazingly reliable.",3 out of 5 stars

For one, this is the loudest car I've ever owned. It rattles, creaks, and squeaks like no other. On a typical drive I'll hear rattles from the sunroof, dashboard, some random panels on the drivers side, and the cargo area. The brakes make a grinding noise every morning when I depress the pedal. Some of the noises are so loud it makes the driving experience miserable, especially for a 2011 model. If you're considering one of these, I highly suggest driving with the stereo off so you can hear for yourself. I'll likely never buy a Toyota again after this experience.

I live in the Sierras, so I need a vehicle with high clearance. At first, I wanted a jeep, but driving two of the Liberty's was like driving a car weighed down by boulders. I couldn't believe how sluggish the Liberty was....Then I drove the RAV -- the thing took off like a rocket. It was almost too responsive -- I tapped the pedal and it would lunge forward.

Acceleration and power is great. Ride could be better, but not bad. Terrible air vibrations when driving with rear windows down (my Liberty did same thing?) Overall interior and exterior functionality is really good. Except...Toyota, this SUV needs a flip-up rear hatch! V6 engine is a little loud for a new Toyota...could be the upgraded alternator.

I still like the RAV4, but now all the little things are starting to poke their heads out. - It definitely rides more like a truck now than when I bought it, with the suspension sending me jarring messages over all but the best of roads. - There are also little rattles and squeaks coming from the riser by my head between the driver and passenger door. - The driver's side window rattles a little (just a tiny amount but it's definitely noticeable to me) - The noise from the rear when doing 25mph or less is horrible. It sounds like a squeaky/rattleing cage. I've looked at all the seals, made sure everything was tightened and nothing helps. - Gas mileage has been stagnant...still 18-20 city and 22 - 25 highway. Other than that, it does what I need it to do (hauling kids to sports, school activies, shopping runs, etc.) so I won't complain too much.

"Ashmaster3000, 11/13/20192012ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 6cyl 5A)","I have a 2012 Limited V6 4WD. If you have a chance to get one of these you should do it! In my opinion it's the best looking Rav4 that's been made. I could have spent the same amount on a much newer SUV with similar miles but I chose the 2012 for a few reasons. 1) the 269hp V6. This is the same V6 from the Avalon and Lexus RX350. It was the fastest car in Toyota's line-up for a time. It's a proven engine with power to spare and they stopped offering it in '13. Any small SUVs with similar power have turbo 4 cylinders that take premium gas... plus turbos break and require more maintenance. It does fine on regular oil every 5000 miles - not expensive synthetic. 2) 4WD. This was the last generation with a 4WD lock button so you can lock the differential at 50/50 front/rear power under 25mph (technically 55/45). That's why these models say 4WD and not AWD. It still has an AWD system that's always active - in most cases you won't need it BUT having the ability to lock the diff is hugely important for deep snow/mud and getting unstuck- or getting through the worst conditions. Without the lockable diff Toyota's AWD system doesn't really keep up with a Subaru or other true 4x4s. 3) Full-size spare tire. Yes, that means the tailgate swings instead of lifts... but driving slow on a tiny spare sucks! It's already saved the day twice. 4) OPTIONS! because this generation of RAV4 is getting older I was able to find one with low miles and all the options I wanted. I have a backup camera, navigation, wireless bluetooth audio/calling, leather heated seats, dual zone climate control, sunroof... great value for the money. Finally, it's a notoriously reliable car even by Toyota standards... every review you will find from Consumer Reports to KBB to Edmunds rates it super high. I've yet to have any problems and that's why you see a TON of this generation on the road. This is my second Rav4 after putting 220k on my 2000.... I'm looking forward to every mile with this one. CONS The factory speakers are terrible (unless it has the JBL system). The interior door seals can be squeaky so you need to keep them clean/lubed. The handling and steering is not very sporty compared to the sport version, subaru, or mazda. Finally, Toyota's Entune system that connects to your phone for apps doesn't work for the newest phones and they don't keep it updated... Bluetooth audio and calling works great though. I average 21 mpg which isn't the best but could be worse considering it has 269hp. Toyota interiors always lag behind in my opinion and while it's comfortable, logically done, and perfectly adequate - it still feels a bit outdated compared to other brands.",5 out of 5 stars
"Stephen, 10/30/20192012ToyotaRAV4Sport 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","I have a 2012 RAV4 Sport FWD purchased as new. The current OD reading is 69,200 miles.
My wife has a 2013 CRV base model FWD purchased as new.  The current OD reading is about 46,000 miles.  We live in Southern California.  Both myself and my wife daily trip to office is about 6 miles highway.  We have few road trips (about 1000+ miles each year).  We drive RAV4 for road trips when we need rooftop cargo for skiing, camping or fishing while drive CRV for the other types.  Our experiences are real as consumer.
Now, let me make comparison. 
Honestly, both these rival models are very good in reliability and quality.
RAV4 has better in handling and will make you feel better grip on road surface while you have a little feeling of shaking in CRV like driving a boat.

The interior of CRV make you feel better in layout setting but the seats are stiff and uncomfortable for long rang trip.
The seats of RAV4 are very comfort.  Especially, the 2nd row was design as adjustable for adding 3rd row.  You can make 2nd row large legroom or roomy cargo space.  When we went camping without set a tent, we put down 2nd row back to make a bed.  Both myself and wife fit in.  I am almost 6' tall. 
Both have good power to easily pass high Sierra Mountains. RAV4 seems have a little better acceleration at low speed.

Let us talk about fuel econ.
I have RAV4 highway MPG about 25-26 with 87 regular gas while 20 in City. The fuel tank is a little more than 12 gal.  I have to add gas about every 300 miles.

The best value of CRV is the ECO mode which make 31-32 MPG. But you don't want use ECO mode when it is heading uphill. Because it feed fuel to 3 cylinders only with ECO mode.  Therefore it has less power while ECO mode is on.  It is good gas saving design during highway cruising.  CRV has larger fuel tank and better gas econ on the road trip.  I can drive from Los Angels to San Jose with one full tank.

So far, RAV4 has one small problem.  The power window on driver side has one loos bolt and nut on driving regulator. Cost me $135 at dealership to open and tight up the nut.
CRV has problem on the passenger side airbag warning light and cost $250 to fix.

Hope these information helpful to you.
Again, RAV4 in fun to drive over CRV and comfy while CRV has better MPG.",4 out of 5 stars

"Central Maryland Dad, 07/14/20162012ToyotaRAV44dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","This 2012 RAV4 Base is my first SUV and I'm pleased with my choice.  I needed a fuel efficient, roomy, do-it-all car for my daily commute, driving the kids, and something my partially disabled wife could drive, too.  I put about 9,000 miles on the SUV since I bought it used in January, including a couple days of central Maryland snow.  So far, this RAV4 does everything well enough and nothing spectacularly.

Performance is adequate.  The 2.5 liter four-banger has enough power for my commute and in-town driving.  Highway merges aren't a problem as long as I'm willing to gun it hard.  The power is barely adequate with three passengers and highway merging is dicey.  My overall fuel economy is a pretty good 27 MPG.  Braking is effective.  The long pedal travel was disconcerting enough that I had the dealer re-check the brakes.  The brakes work well under all conditions once I got the feel of them.

The car holds the road suprisingly well, much better than I expected from an SUV.  The steering is predictable and solid.  The four-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and the gear changes are merely noticeable, even under hard acceleration.  I hardly notice them any more.

Front seat comfort is okay.  I'm 6'4"" and weigh about 310 pounds.  Leg room is sufficient and I have plenty of headroom, about three inches.  I wish the seat had better thigh support.  The seat cushions are very firm, almost hard.  The side bolsters hold me in place nicely, even during hard curves and corners.  All of my drive times have been shorter than an hour.  I have no information about longer trips.

The rear seat is surprisingly roomy.  Teenagers (up to 5'8"") can sit behind me and still have enough room to be comfortable.  I could sit behind me and have enough room!  The rear seat cushions are as firm as the front seat cushions.  However, my teenaged rear seat passengers ride for short trips and haven't complained.

My main interior complaint is the frikkin' noise!  A lot of engine and tire noise penetrate the cabin.  Road noise is so bad that I can't listen to the radio.  I stopped playing the radio during my commute lest my ears ring painfully at the end of the trip.

Cargo and storage is cavernous.  I love it!  I'm glad the first owner did not get the optional third row seat.  There are plenty of pockets, cubbies, and other cavities for small things.  The cavernous cargo space is a boom box, though.  I think half of the road noise is amplified back there.",4 out of 5 stars

"peter, 11/10/20152012ToyotaRAV44dr SUV 4WD (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","I have owned multiple RAV4s; and my family has purchased 6 Toyota cars/SUVS in the past nine years.  Our feeling is that the management is profiting by diluting the quality of the brand.  The 2012 RAV4 is a relatively competent vehicle, in that it handles all kinds of weather with little drama. It also has large and flexible capacities to move people and goods and very good visibility.  The platform has not evolved over a decade of changing oil prices and it remains highly inefficient at 23 miles per gallon in combined driving over 36000 miles for the 4 cylinder model.  The 4 speed transmission belongs in the stone age.  The brand dilution is most notable in some of the interior materials and the quality of the electronic interfaces.  The seat materials in the base and sport models are poor.  The seats have relatively good padding but they will stain if water is poured on them inadvertently.  Either the company did not test the materials or is profiting from the sale of Scotchguard.   The arm rests on the doors are akin to sand paper in the summer; make sure when you test drive this car you do not have on heavy coats as this flaw will become apparent in the warmer months.  Most of the interior is lower quality harder plastics, which scratch with ease.  The stereo options are uninspired.  In our case we experienced electrical problems just after the warranty expired and the dealership had little sympathy.  As mediocre as the ownership experience was for this car, it appears the newer models are even less desirable.  I look for Toyota to refocus on solid engineering platforms and the highest quality customer experience and to eschew their search for marketing gimmickry and the bottom line that keeps their cars in a constant state of recalls.",4 out of 5 stars

Brakes sound as if they are dragging especially as I first drive down the driveway. The power port is inaccessible if drinks are in the drink holder. I like having a full sized tire and one which you needn't unload the storage space to access. Be sure to check the pressure in it if having low pressure readings.

The storage space is amazing! When we went to buy my husbands highlander a few months ago they asked if I wanted to upgrade my Rav 4 to the new one, but I love the style of the 2012 model and did not want to upgrade.

The leg room and storage in the RAV4 is excellent.
Lots of storage and room for luggage.
The rear seats recline and move forward and backward.
I have had the car in heavy winds and it handled the windy conditions well. Interior noise is low, compared to Honda CRV. Love 4wd button.
Reliability of the Rav4 is the best.
I looked at the reviews of the competing cars and read about the problems people have for their cars.
The Rav4 had minor complaints compared to others having significant problems. after market platinum 0 deductable warranty for $950 upgrading it to a 7/100k had to shop around for the price. 12k miles owned, very happy",5 out of 5 stars
"allie_oop, 05/24/20132012ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (2.5L 4cyl 4A)","I've had my Rav4 for a year and took it to the dealer to have the transmission checked.
When making a low speed turn, after braking then pressing the accelerator, the automatic transmission shifts roughly. It feels like a new driver just learning to drive a manual transmission.
The dealer test drove it, identified the issue, then said that was normal and there is nothing wrong with my Rav4.
Other dislikes: hard seats, brake too close to accelerator, doors sound tinny when closed, keyless ignition locks up randomly, too many lever controls on steering column (3 with wipers, lights, and cruise control)",2.5 out of 5 stars

I don't drag race but when I want to pass drivers driving below the speed limit, it will accelerate definitely and easily since it is a V6. I drive in town most of the time and I am getting 25.5 mpg. If I am driving in bigger cities, though rare, with lots of stop and go, the mpg will go down to 25.3. Very little difference. Most of the time it stays on 25.5. There are no hills in where I live and even the places that I go. There's less traffic as well. My ride is comfortable. My only complaint is the road noise. This RAV4 has some of it.

Car downshifts/4000rpm on some overpasses and ALL small hills at 70-80 mph. Wind blows it all over the road.

As one reviewer noted, the accelerator pedal is a bit sensitive, but you readily adjust to that.
I consider fuel economy to be pretty good--23MPG in daily driving, 30 on the highway, at least if you're not trying to pass everybody on the road.
I would think the V-6 would be a must for anyone towing or carrying heavy loads.

I had done extensive online comparisons between the 3 of the contenders in this vehicle category: the Rav4, Honda CRV, and the Nissan Rogue. We test drove all 3, as well as a Jeep Patriot, and considered but didn't drive a Hyundai Tucson. Toyota won out on a number of counts, not the least of which was the fact that we have been Yota owners for a long time, and have had great success. Toyota was also offering some screaming incentives which tipped the scales.

I guess I was not paying enough attention on the test drive. This is the most bouncy jouncy bumpy car I have ever driven. every tiny bump/crack in the pavement is transferred right to your kidneys. I'm not sure if it's because of the sport suspension or the 18"" run flats. It is better on the freeway.The V6 is also a bit too powerful for this car, if such a thing can be possible. A tinny box like this should not be able to go so fast. the throttle is also super touchy which can be unpleasant if you are too heavy with your foot.

"Carey Dean, 10/27/2017updated02/22/20192013ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I have owned Toyotas now for going on 15 years. I had decided I would never buy anything but Toyota. I had always had great sales experiences and liked the products. Recently I got a letter in the mail that my RAV 4 may have a faulty torque converter. After reviewing the signs I quickly knew that I had been experiencing the signs of this issue and had been for some time. I took my care to the dealership as instructed. After review I was told I did have a faulty converter but also now a failing transmission. Toyota refused to take responsibility for the fact that the defective part caused damage to my transmission. I have been to two other mechanics since who tell me there is no doubt the two are related. I have the unique opportunity of being a community health nurse in my area therefore I get to be really present in my community. I often have patients and other nurses ask me about my car my experience. I actually have convinced on of my fellow nurses and one customer to purchase a RAV4. Due to this situation and Toyotas refusal to stand behind their product I plan to use every opportunity I have to let everyone I come into contact with know that choosing Toyota is a mistake. I also have several friends who are car salesman, I am going to share this experience with them so that they can let interested car buyers know that Toyota does not stand behind their products and that they are a bad choice. I had planned to purchase another Toyota for myself and one for my daughter this year as she is going away to college. I will definitely never do business with you again and will make it my mission to ensure to encourage everyone I know to do the same.",1 out of 5 stars
"Dave, 07/24/2018updated01/24/20192013ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","This is my first Toyota. I am the original owner with about 70K miles since purchase. Had an issue with transmission shudder but recall replaced the torque converter at no charge and extended the warranty for the transmission to 150K. I have had the Toyota extended warranty to 100K with free oil and filter changes. Dealership service has been very good. As stated in the Edmunds review the vehicle is no speed demon [4 cylinder, 176 HP] however I have never found it to be lacking of power when I stand on the gas, it responds well. Interior [dash] is a bit plain but all controls are user friendly. Does not have navigation as I get better navigation from my cell phone. Fuel economy has been very good based on driving conditions. I average between 26 and 32 [city, highway] and am light on the gas when accelerating. Entry and exit is good as it sits up higher than sedans which are a problem particularly for exiting by my spouse and myself. Would like fold flat rear seats when hauling cargo, otherwise an all around good vehicle. Will consider buying another Rav4 but with all the competition in a few years the market may change considerably. With three Toyotas [two Prius and one Rav4] in our history we will likely stay with Toyota. They do need to upgrade the interior to bring a little more class and keep up with its competitors.Performance4 out of 5 stars",4 out of 5 stars

"Shawn, 08/08/20182013ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","So, this is our main car!  We go everywhere in this thing (wife and 4 kids).  The Pros: It is a Toyota with great resale value, 0 mechanical problems than regular maintenance (oil changes, brakes and tires), comfortable interior for the entire family, LOTS of cubby hole storage hidden all over this car, handles great on sunny/rainy/snowy days (I feel very comfortable with my wife taking a drive in the snow with the kiddos in this SUV).  For the 4 cyl engine, it has a higher tow capacity than any other comparable SUV I have found.  The Cons: Not really much to say here though have two very minor things to comment on: 1) the reverse camera does not allow you to toggle for directional tracking of where your car will be with the angle of the wheels.  This is a very handy feature to have that is missing here. 2) The USB plug barely charges your phone.  As this overrides the BT function of the radio and phone, your music and such are fed through the USB, but your battery will still drain.  Leaving BT on and having my iPhone plugged in on a 2hr drive my phone lost 23% battery life instead of charging.  Road performance.  I have driven Toyota's many times in my life and am a huge fan of the Rav.  It has a peppy pickup and go from stop or while in motion.  Sometimes (especially in my town where speed limit is often 25mph) maybe a little too much pep?  I find myself taking my foot off the gas very quickly to coast and ride the brake time to time in residential areas.  The visibility for the driver can hardly be beat than with the Rav.  Very few blind spots.  A U-turn does require a little more than a standard 2 lane road with the expansion of the wheel base, but still, for the extra foot length of the car to its predecessor, I'll make the swap.  Road noise is there but not bad at all.  You feel the road without feeling like you are being beaten to death by it, lol.  A smooth ride in a vehicle that can still hug curves at decent rates without squealing tires.  Interior comfort.  My kids have plenty of leg room in the back, and if the front passenger and driver are willing to give up a very little bit of theirs, adults can be in the backseat comfortably.   The cup holders for front and back are well placed, and the seats are comfortable.  Personally i feel the front seats have a bit more padding in them for the rump than the back seats.  As I am a bigger guy and my knees don't like me squatting into and out of sedans much any more, I find the access very easy without having to climb up and in.   The back area of the car with the rear seat up is quite large for a small SUV.  My Mastiff ( a 160lb dog) fits back there comfortably.  If I need both of my dogs to go somewhere, then the seats have to be folded down.  Gas MPG is decent for an SUV with AWD.  Before we moved to the mountains we were getting approx 26 in city and 32 on highway.  Now I need to get my car tuned for the altitude as we are down to 22/28 MPG.",5 out of 5 stars

I bought this vehicle from my dad who had this before me and he loved it. He is 82 and was just ready for another vehicle. The interior is roomy, the instrumentation is easy to learn and view and the comfort of the seats is fine. Seats are not as comfy as the Volvo I just sold but are good for an SUV. Has the heated leather (or imitation) seats that are comfortable and easy to maneuver and the gas mileage is awesome, especially when you put it in Eco mode. My dad didn't know about the different settings (said he never knew they were there) due to their awkward location but I am fine with it. I don't switch modes when I am driving anyway, I keep it on Eco. At present, the tires that are on the vehicle do not ride smooth and make a humming noise but I am convinced that is due to the tires, not the vehicle. I drive 120 miles to and from work so I need comfort, economy, a good sound system and storage space for my ""stuff,"" golf clubs, foldable chair, etc. So far this vehicle is excellent for what I need.

"Peter R., 01/23/20182013ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I have had my RAV for almost five years now and it's been a great vehicle.  Despite being the first year of the redesign, this SUV has been super reliable.  I can't recall having anything fixed or repaired during the past five years.  It's been that good!  Aside from the reliability, the gas mileage is another highlight.  I usually get 28 MPG in mixed driving, which is outstanding.  I am a fairly conservative driver, but that is still outstanding.  I love the blue interior lighting.  Also, with 56K miles, I still have the original Toyo tires, which have worn very well.  I'll probably need to get new tires at 60K miles.  I have the basic sound system, not the JBL upgrade, and the sound is excellent...good powerful bass and crisp treble.  The bluetooth and navigation work pretty well, although the nav has slow response time and sometimes misses the target location by a half mile or more!  One gripe is that the fake leather gets very warm in the heat and doesn't breathe at all, leaving me with a sweaty back!  The ride can be a little on the firm side too, especially at lower speeds on side roads.  The highway ride is reasonably smooth and quiet.  Lastly, the interior design is a bit of a mish-mash...lots of different colors and textures that don't always look like they belong together.  Overall, I've been very happy with my '13 RAV4 Limited!",5 out of 5 stars
"Bobby Johns, 10/31/2016updated10/31/20172013ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I've owned a Rav4 since 2013, the redesign model year. If there's one thing you should know, it is this:               The interior cabin is filled with rattles and squeaks.                In less than three years (still under warranty as I write this), I've had no less than 4 different rattles and tapping noises to chase down. This started before 1K miles!                        The materials are very cheap Chinese plastics. I had one HUGE dash vent rattle fixed by the dealer. I'd been to the dealer a total of three times to fix the other noises and a ""catch"" in the moonroof cover to no avail. So, I've had to watch youtube videos on how to take apart the dash pieces to fix them myself.                                      After taking the dash apart, one thing is apparent: If Toyota would use slightly better grade materials and have the factory workers put another few minutes into assembling the interior, this could all be avoided.               The other thing you should know about is the Info- tainment system. Toyota Entune system is a joke and all Nav head unit functions are slow and clunky especially when compared to other auto makes from the same era. It's like Toyota was 3 years behind the others in what they offered and how smoothly it works… another obvious COST CUTTING measure.                                                                                            Other than the glaring interior quality issues and a slightly harsh ride on the 18"" Bridgestone Dueler stock tires, the motor, transmission and brakes have been fine so far.

Last words: I bought this car blindly on the history of owning 9 Toyotas before it. My mistake but who would think these guys could build such a P O S after a long history with the brand?

The Toyota Care is outstanding. The only complaint I have is the upholstery. I bought what I thought was leather but it turns out to be Soft Tech which is a vinyl. The color is beige and stains very easily. Seats have blue jean staining and it will not come off! The dealership is no help on this issue. They ""kinda"" change the subject when I bring it up.

Have not made any road trips yet. I am 5'11"" and my husband is 6'2"" and we both are quite comfortable. Vehicle has good pick up so no worries about merging onto interstate. Test drove Mazda CX5 and Honda CRV. RAV4 offered more options in the base price
and the cabin was not as noisy. Black carpet shows every speck of sand. Floor mats are a flimsy for the extra cost (nearly $300.00). Ordered an extra set online (must more cost friendly) to have on hand. ""RAVen"" (I have named her) is a real looker. Removal of ""barn"" rear door was the best thing ever!!!! 

9/14/2016 Still love ""RAVen"".  I have 45,0000 miles on her.  She still looks and runs very well.  I thought I ordered leather seats but they are not.  The synthetic fabric stains easily and things like blue jean and  ink from paper transfers are impossible to remove.  Think Toyota should offer a choice of leather or the synthetic fabric. The gas millage is not as good as when she was new. Averages about 24 miles per gallon in city and a little more (28) on highway.  Will be replacing her in January 2017, not because I have any issues, because I will be retiring and want a new vehicle. Would consider a RAV4 if the body style changes greatly.

Then as we drove it little things just got annoying. Front seat driver and passenger shoulder to shoulder, the sliding console always moving at the wrong times, smaller steering wheel and guages. The Sport button and other buttons hidden behind shifter so low that you had to take your eyes off the road to make adjustments. My wife and I are not large people and we felt a little clostraphobic. What pushed us over the edge was that our 2 labs had no place to move in the back seat and the last straw was the short wheelbase and Bridgestone Duellers that caused every bump to vibrate the entire car. Have to mention that the Duellers were horrible in the snow. Pluses were gas mileage and looks. I couldn't take it anymore and bought a Highlander Limited and I haven't regretted that choice. Should have done that a year prior. Nevertheless, if you like a 1 person car and don't mind kidney vibrations the RAV is a good choice.

In 9/2020 I wrote that the RAV at 51,000 miles ""has been Toyota reliable except for a failed CD drive at year 4.  There is bluetooth and a USB input so all is not lost.  Still comfortable at speed on smooth interstates.""  6 months later:  The RAV seems to me to be aging rapidly.  Total miles are about 51,500 --  I've driven only 2,000 miles in the past 14 months(!)  In addition to the unrepairable CD drive mentioned in September, the keyless entry system has failed.  Second:  The car's ride is now very unsettled -- I've had shocks and etc thoroughly checked by my customary dealer.  They find nothing.  Maybe my problem is new stiff tires?  -- But I think that's at best only part of the issue.  So the ride is now UNacceptable to me on any surface.   Realignments are necessary about every 2 years if your streets are as rough as mine.  So the RAV is still reliable & trouble-free mechanically, but noise and ride are wearing me out.  Others may not care or notice such changes. Other trim levels or more recent versions of this RAV may be quite different. Please note that Toyota recently did a thorough re-do of the RAV, so current new RAV's may be much different.  I will say -- my experience with the 2014 RAV is dramatically different from my 10 years with a 2004 Camry LE which overall was an astonishingly good ""basic transportation"" vehicle.

My last three vehicles are a 2013 Mini Cooper ""S"" Hardtop, a 1996 Chrysler Concorde and a 1996 Chrysler LHS. My 2014 RAV4 kicks them all to the curb.

The MINI Cooper is too dangerous here in ""HUGE SUV-LAND, Denver Colorado"". I was cut off and forced into the end of a guard rail by an ignorant Audi driver (and ...really ...aren't all Audi drivers ignorant and arrogant?"" The driver was arrested for leaving the scene and several other charges.

THe MINI Cooper was a total loss, so I bought a 2014 AWD RAV4 with only 36,000 miles on it. A ""Certified Toyota Used Car"" which means new windshield, new tires, new engine parts where available. It was like a new car with a similar warranty. I bought it from a dealer. BEST move I have ever made. The car is a dream. There is no stopping it even in these Denver snow storms. And that 2.5 Liter 4-cylinder actually chirps the tires shifting into second on hard acceleration. Plenty of power!!

My wife has a 2012 RAV4 Limited with the 3.5L V6, and I must admit ...it is an awesome powertrain, and sad that Toyota ditched it in 2013. Witness every time we go into a Toyota dealership a salesman approaches my wife and offers her a generous price for it, since the 2012 was the last year the 3.5L was offered on the RAV4. She politely declines. Her car is paid for, and likely to go 500,000 miles or more. It has over 100,000 on it and drives nice, crisp and tight like a new car ...still!

"JShoup, 08/17/2018updated08/26/20192014ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","When you buy a Toyota, you expect to have it fo 200,000 miles or more, and this is well on it’s way there. Zero major repair issues (knock on wood), strong highway mileage of 30MPG, and a great riding position make this the favorite SUV ever. We’ve had a Highlander, which was also outstanding, but the RAV4 is a little bit less and and a little bit easier. Easier to park, easier on the wallet. I would buy another one tomorrow.

About three years into owning the RAV4, the only issues we’ve had are a mis-signaling tire pressure warning (minor), and the failure of the radio system (annoying!). Apparently, the radio issue is something that’s well known in the Toyota owner message boards. Replaced it with one from an electronics store for $250, and it’s better and more current than what came with the car.",5 out of 5 stars

So the dealer turned off the engine lights and they were able to trade it in for a Jeep which they have had now for 5 years with no problem.

Here are the impressions. 1) Handling low speed is great.  Nimble and quick.  On the highway it's downright dangerous.  Wanders aimlessly with no road feel. Best snow driving car ever, though!  And we have had Jeeps 'forever'. 2) Brakes are terrible but dealer says 'normal'.  As you come to a rolling stop, like a traffic light, the pedal suddenly drop about an inch or more.  You react by pumping to brake to restore height. 3) Transmission shift great up and down.  CVT is impressive.  4) Interior issues include a) the silly armrest slides back and forth about 100 times a day when driving or getting in/out; b) Like most, the backup camera is pretty much worthless during the day/great at night.  Also, the angle of the screen forces the driver to lean to passenger seat to view clearly day or night. 5) Radio is very poor.  Turns on, Changes stations or modes or even volume by itself.  Even if you are not touching the steering wheel at all.  Dealer says 'normal'. 6) Great for little people but sucks if you are tall.  Getting in/out a challenge and, because there is no tilt function on the steering wheel, you smash your knees every time.  7) Annoyances include: a) Cheaped out idea to use the same switch on driver/passenger door locks saved them 10 cents but make it tough to use since lock functions are opposite on passenger door; b)  Downright silly programming on the rear hatch lift.  And poor button placement too.  Needs an exact set of circumstances to allow open/close. b) Also silly programming n the chime alerts.  You'll spend lots of time trying to figure out what it wants and getting it to shut up is often a multi-person game.; c) Information screen is worthless and tiny. d) Seat belt attachment point is too low.  You spend a lot of time just trying to get it high enough to connect. e) Supports for power liftgate are out pretty far.  Be prepared to whack your head often if taller.  New iisues: water flowing in around windshield.  2018 Update: I figured out the screwy radio issues: system remembers even passive steering wheel button contact EVEN WHEN CAR IS OFF.  Then, when you turn he car on, it starts going thru button command you may have accidentally hit while exiting the car.  Very strange.  Just try and replace the rear wiper. All blade  manufzcturers show their blades fit. They do not. Toyota wants you to buy from them alone for big $$$$.",3 out of 5 stars

I have had electronic malfunction with locks which have been replace numerous times.  It was fine when it was under warranty, but now that it is out of warranty. Right front passenger door won't open with key fob or with button on drivers side.  It needs new actuator to the tune of $260.00, which is simply a magnet in the door to signal the lock to open and close. I called Toyota and they would DO NOTHING.  How can you stand by your quality of your parts which can't even seem to last over a year?  This vehicle is 4 years old.  Now the radio stopped working. Same problem hundreds of others are complaining about with the same year Rav 4.  Are you kidding me? The dealer wants $1200.00 to replace.

The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. 

Review update:

Currently in August 2017, This 2014 RAV-4 has been seized by my wife and I have to use her 2014 Prius-4 to get around town and to commute to work. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive  at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)

After 3 years driving the 2014 RAV-4, we (my wife and I) have no issues. We found it quite fast when use ""Power"" button. Now the model is becoming old and out of style. I just wish that Toyota will come up with something slightly bigger with more ground clearance, more cargo area and adjustable rear seats (for smart cargo management). put exhaust pipe  in higher place undercarriage. We also want to see more color options for next generation. If we don't see new features, we might have to pick CRV instead.",5 out of 5 stars

Soft ride when going over 45 mph but a little rough suspension on the rear feels like a truck suspension. One thing i do miss is the sunglasses holder.

My 2014 RAV 4 was the XLE with front wheel drive only which was rated for 24 city and 31 hwy mpg. I have over 5000 miles on it and have taken multiple highway trips and driven it to work locally each day. No mater what driving condition, I have only achieved 24 mpg.  I tried different gas octanes and no difference.  My Mazda's always achieved there rated mileage so the idea of my driving habits have nothing to do with it. This car is a lemon and the dealer will not even talk to me about it. I cannot promote this car that does not do what it was advertised to do.  Two years later and the gas mileage still sucks!  No improvement.
Update-2017: I traded this gas sucking RAV-4 and got a nice Honda CRV that gets 35 mpg as advertised.  On the RAV-4, the Berglund Toyota dealer in Lynchburg VA and Toyota HQ refused to back their advertising and did nothing but try to blame it on my driving!

Seriously,this Rav4,is a fun driving experience..***Update..So,I love this Rav4 more than I ever thought ,especially this winter!,I put studded snow tires on it,much to the consternation of many of the 'old timers' .But ,I have a job that makes me HAVE to get to it,no matter what,and this has been a heavy duty winter so far.Many times,when I leave for work? The roads have not even been plowed.Im the first one on the road.My sweet Rav4 just eats up the snowy,icy road,like it was made for it! Slow and steady,and it will go anywhere!.For a minute,last fall,I considered trading it in towards a Toyota truck.I am so glad that I didn't! I love this vehicle,and yes,there ARE some blind spots,but Ive learned to work around them..In my opinion? This is the PERFECT winter vehicle.We call it""the Tundra mobile""...Gas milage,in the winter is down to 23 mpg,but its ok.The quality of the ride is amazing! Update..I am still in love with my Rav4.in the 3rd winter..Wonderful.I can go anywhere.STILL! the perfect winter vehicle.+++Update again..after 3 years? I STILL love this vehicle..Yes there are a few annoyances.The interior lights thing,{Youll see} and there are some HUGE blind spots.Luckily I am able to turn and twist and see them,and the camera helps too.To replace the rear wiper blade,you have to have a special tool,or go to a dealer.Other than that? I love it!  update..I still love my Rav4. The only issues have been the tps monitors.They are always on and replacing them {130$ a pop) dosent seem to make any difference..Ie learned to check the tire pressure myself.Cant rely on the monitors. one year later! Still! No problems with this wonderful vehicle except the TPS monitors..Ive replaces all of them.at great expense,but they still light up my dash.Oh well,nothing that some well placed tape cant remedy.Still LOVE my RAV$....same still.What an excellent vehicle!Tps monitors still acting up but thats a small wrinkle.  Update###Ive had this Rav4 for 6 years and it is still the most trustworthy vehicle Ive ever owned! The TPS monitors are just not...able to be fixed,but Ive learned to use a tie presser checker..All in all? A Fabulous vehicle!...year later.still love it.Replaced front and rear brakes,no other maintenance required.,92k miles..Still love this vehicle.",5 out of 5 stars

"Joe, 08/18/2015updated10/05/20222015ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership.  An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy.  The warranty is 36,000 miles.  That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty.  Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300.  Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer.  I went through arbitration on July 8, 2015.  I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications.  In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening.  In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.  Otherwise the vehicle operates fine.  However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers.  I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device.  Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy.  Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there.  Great for hauling stuff such as bags of dirt, mulch, compost, trees, rocks, and even 4x8 plywood.  Went tent camping without any problems and ferried it to a couple of islands.   Have taken a couple of 3,000 mile trips:  Speed averaged 75 on one and 83 on the other over plains and mountains.  RAV4 performed flawlessly and had no problems passing other vehicles.  MPG was anywhere from 26 to 29.  On secondary roads on trips the gas mileage averaged 33.   Very quiet engine but outside road noise was very pronounced (loud).  The backup camera and blind spot monitor are great safety devices that if you can afford them, they are worth it.  The lane monitor not very useful because it can't read lanes in a great variety of road conditions.   Very easy vehicle to maneuver and drive.  Learned to appreciate the automatic lights which I now leave on 7/24/365.  Wish it had a stand alone compass as it contained in the navigation screen.  Of course the navigation system is obsolete before you drive it off the lot because the data in the sym card is obsolete and Toyota wants $200 for updates which is again obsolete before you put it in.  Best to use your phone or a Garmin -- your phone is always updated and Garmin you can update it for free.  Does not have Homelink; was almost a deal breaker.  In August/September 2018 completed a round trip from Omaha to New Brunswick, Canada putting over 4700 miles.  Averaged 31.1 mpg going 70 to 75 mph driving west but got a little better driving east.  Again, the operation of this vehicle was -- no other way to say it -- flawless.  Recently moved to New Hampshire and because of the roads dictate the speeds, my mpg has jumped from 27 to 32.  Currently have 78,900 miles on it.  Battery went out at about 65,000 and brakes will need to be replaced at 73,000.  These are expected maintaince items but brakes lasting 73000 is excetional.",4 out of 5 stars

"Thomas Hornick, 11/22/2015updated12/02/20212015ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","December 2021...Some minor changes ... The gas mileage is average for a vehicle of its size. The reliability has been good. But it is a great SUV, plenty of leg room (I am 6' - 1"") as I can really get comfortable in it, the interior is well laid out, love the way they did the leather, the ride is great, handles great for a vehicle its size. It is just the perfect SUV for my wife, dog and I. It is a fun vehicle to drive. Love the AWD (were in a very bad rain storm the other day and it handled outstanding, no problems with the wet roads).  STILL A BIG ISSUE...Still have the issue with the push button start button is that it can be left in another position other than off, in gear or neutral and start rolling forward or backwards even on a slight grade which can present a dangerous situation. Been there, done that and I really do not like the push button. With a key you had to take the key out of the switch, in the key off position with the transmission in park. Definitely a lot safer than the set up you have with the push button start. This has changed as we did not have an issue with the sun roof (another issue arises every year, sometime in late spring I have to take the vehicle in and get them to clean out the drain line for the sun roof. It plugs up at that time (I think it is from all of the pollen in the air at spring time when everything is producing vast amounts of pollen) and water will get in the headliner. It cost me $85.00 each time to get it cleaned out...and I need to clean the water stain out of the headliner. The dealership just states that is just normal...Yea, I bet!!!)",5 out of 5 stars
"cookie, 08/27/20212015ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","So we own one 2015 rav4 and we did not have a lot of problems with the car. We thought everything else was fine as well, but there are some other issues appears. First of all, the road noise is not acceptable. We did not notice this issue until we get a new chevy home. It's a significant comparison that the noise person in the second row has to suffer in toyota rav4 versus the noise level in the chevy for the second raw passenger. Also, we drove once on the road and it was very windy, rav4 almost get blew out of the lane and I had to adjust the direction of the steering wheel to be able to stay in the lane. Same windy situation for the chevy, chevy handles it pretty well. Also the transmission seems like very big gaps when the car is accelerating. It is a significant feeling that the car has some gap when transmission is trying to gear up. Information system is just almost not existing, but only for the very basic functions and the reverse camera. Generally saying, the only thing rav4 offers is reliability, but if you care about the comfortable level and more details of the interior just consider some other better choices such as Honda, Mazda, Chevy and so on.",2 out of 5 stars

"vikred, 03/18/20212015ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","We bought our 2015 XLE FWD used in Jan 2018. It had 65k miles on it and was well maintained.

Spacious: Five adults can sit comfortably in this car and the trunk too is very big, with a low loading lip. In fact, you can even use it as a bench to sit on when picnicking. The rear seats fold flat so that you can carry longer cargo. It looks like the later gen model has less passenger and cargo space.

Gas mileage: In city driving, with a few minutes of idling thrown in (to run AC), I get 20-22 mpg. On the highways when I do a constant 75-85 mph, I get 28-31 mpg.

Performance: Good that Toyota hasn't moved to turbocharged engines for their best sellers in the US. Big, simple, naturally-aspirated engines are my favorite for their low-end torque. This vehicle has no problem accelerating and keeping up with 90mph cars on I-5.

Maintenance: No issues besides yearly oil changes and tire rotations done by a neighborhood family-owned mechanic. The first owner bought ToyotaCare. So, it was very well taken care of, at dealership shops. The only unexpected thing I got done was the rear shocks, as one of them started leaking, leading to bouncy ride. The parts too were super cheap, $70 for a set of two.",5 out of 5 stars

"Stacy Wilson, 07/08/2017updated01/12/20212015ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","A surprisingly zippy little SUV, but too many negatives. The #1 issue that I have is the squeaks, creaks, and road noise inside this car. I recently discovered an industry term, 'NVH' - which rates Noise, Vibration, and Hazzard. This Rav4 has the WORST NVH rating. Sure wish I knew about this term prior to purchasing this car. On the hunt for a top rated NVH vehicle. I purchased this vehicle brand new, 2015 Rav4 Limited. Within the first few months, the dashboard began squeaking and creaking - I have a TBI, and cannot tolerate this type of noise. Plus, the road noise coming up into the car from the tires, frame, etc - is brutal. The dealership said that Toyota has 'templates, of an absorbing type of material. The dashboard would be dropped, template installed, problem fixed. Well, that particular squeak and rattle anyway. They informed me that if they went ahead with this repair, they would need to drop the entire dashboard - separating thousands of 'contact points within the dashboard - and the end result would be LOTS of more squeaks. Wow. Also, very very tight seating, even in the front seats. Unless you are a 'petite' person, and do not have any issues with serious road noise in the car while driving, it is a fun little car to bop around with, and the cargo room is fantastic. Update January 2021: Still do not like this car, for the same reasons posted. Plus it is also very top heavy with a very narrow base. But the gas mileage is quite impressive, especially when in the 'Economy Mode'. I would NOT recommend the Toyota Rav4.",2 out of 5 stars

Go the extra mile and get the Convenience Package it makes driving much more enjoyable. 
After driving it for over 6 months, I wish It would have power seats. The XLE is uncomfortable on longer trips.

We eventually had to part ways when I was hit by a drunk driver, flipped twice, and landed upside down. I walked away very shaken up but completely unharmed. My only ""injury"" was some bruising from the seatbelt (but I maintain that was because I was hanging upside down for a few minutes before I was rescued). I had a 2015 LE model afterward, and it didn't hold up as well on slick roads but still a beautiful car.

Dealer says everything in spec..  Next issue is steering.  The electric steering is very nimble but car wanders around lanes at highway speed.  You can hold the steering wheel rock steady and still drift in and out of you lane,  Dealer says everything in spec.  Last issue is the radio.  It changes modes, volume goes up and down by itself and, on the way home from the last service at Toyota, it turned itself on with high volume.  Less than 5000 miles since new.  

It's a cute, nimble car around town and the best snow vehicle we ever owned (traded in a Jeep).  If someone would address these issues it could be a real winner.

Rear camera is great at night.  Completely worthless during the daylight hours or in rain  The angle of the srceen is great for back seat people but worthless for driver or passengers  up front.  Cannot safely be used.

Constant chimes and alerts are way overdone.  Many times, the alerts point to no cause and we give up and walk away with the beeping or chimes.  Sometimes not possible since doors won't lock.  Crazy.

Windshield is leaking some clear polymer.  Strangest thing evet.  First thought it was tree sap but it only appears in the exact same places.

This 'legendary' Toyota quality is a fraud.  So many simple things gone so wrong.  Last Toyota in our household.

Update 12.28.17 Still runs well and mileage is improving.  Some other things you should be aware of include: FEW BACKLIT SWITCHES. Very dangerous at night since placement of switches is downright silly at times. Not knowing what a switch does make it dangerous.  EXTREMELY POOR INTERIOR LIGHTING No lighting would be a better description.  Now that days are short you realize that there are virtually no lights throughout the interior - but especially in the rear areas.LACK OF A TRUE ADJUSTABLE STEERING WHEEL It moves about 4 inches up/down and the up lift height  is a joke. INFORMATION PANEL IS A JOKE Utterly worthless due to small size. INTERIOR PANELS LIGHTS DIM TOO MUCH  If your put your headlights on with your wipers (a law in our state) display lights like the clock are invisible..  CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW POOR THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN IS Because it does not adjust it is only useful at night. And even then you must lean over the center console to see it.  Dumb, dumb.  WATCH YOUR HEAD WITH THE POWER TAILGATE LIFT TUBES. Unique problem here. They are positioned perfectly to smash your head.

"susieq33, 05/27/2015updated05/30/20182015ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I waited to write this review, since I wanted to take a decent road trip.  Having just got back from a trip to and from Ohio to SC, I now feel I can write an honest review.  This is a great vehicle.  I have owned Hondas for the past 25 years or more, the latest being a 2008 CR-V, and was bored with the same interior look and features.  I test drove multiple vehicles, SUVs and sedans.  The RAV 4 is extremely nice looking (Pearl White) and runs and rides perfectly.  Got 29.6 miles per gallon on average, using heat, defrosters and air conditioning through rain, fog, and sleet. The RAV-4 Limited offers a comfortable ride, great handling. The heated seats/lower back are outstanding No complaints.  ****UPDATE**** Ater having this RAV4 for almost 3 years now, and after several long road trips, it continues to make me happy. The only problem I've had is that the tire pressure sensors are extremely sensitive and tend to show low air pressure frequently in winter months with temperature changes. Otherwise, the ride, acceleration, and gas mileage is great. Averaged 30 to 31 mpg on our most recent trip from Ohio to SC.   The power in the normal mode is so good for passing or entering freeways that I have never switched into sport mode. The economy mode's mpg was equal to using the normal mode, so why have a more sluggish vehicle and not gain anything? I drive in the normal mode all the time and with combined city and highway driving, usually average around 28 mpg and 27 in the winter.  Have had many back seat passengers remark on how roomy and comfortable the back seats are. Oil changes are a bit more expensive due to using synthetic oil.  The only changes I woukd make to do something with the cup holders, which are too deep for some items, adding a smaller, covered storage area for a cell phone or similar,  a button to program the garage door opener, and automatic headlights when windshield wipers are in use, and better speakers as the sound is not the greatest at lower levels. That being said, even without those fixes we would purchase the RAV4 again, without hesitation.  UPDATE: May 2018, now have almost 40,000 on the car. Still getting good gas mileage, recently 30 mpg on a trip from Ohio to SC. My only complaint is that the middle dashboard area where the console is has some squeaks and rattles that is annoying. Plastic on plastic, I guess. Otherwise, hauled two boxes with fully assembled outdoor rocking chairs in it a month ago, they fit perfectly. Lots of room I. The cargo area with the seats down. Have driven on many long road trips and the seats are comfortable, the ride is nice and the engine never struggles, even in the mountains. Great acceleration for passing.  Overall very happy with this vehicle. In fact, my husband wants me to get a new one so he can have this one, and I am not ready to part with it.Technology4 out of 5 starsPerformance5 out of 5 starsInterior4 out of 5 starsComfort5 out of 5 starsReliability5 out of 5 starsValue5 out of 5 stars",5 out of 5 stars

"Madeleine, 12/11/2015updated12/26/20172015ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I have had this car about a month.  I live in the mountains and wanted a car with decent acceleration that would be good in winter weather.  The 2.5 engine has been fine even on steep hills at altitude.  I've driven it in snowy, icy conditions (with snow tires) and it handles well and feels smooth.  The automatic transmission can slide over to manual and a nudge of the shift lever up or down changes the gear.  This gives the car the clutch breaking of a standard transmission and I have used it on icy, snowy downhills when I don't want to brake a lot.  At first, I used the sport setting on hills, but I've found it climbs as well on the normal setting.  I got the Limited because I love the push button start (I'm a key loser) and the automatic headlights.  I also like the vinyl seats which are easy to wipe clean.  The technology features are helpful.  For example, a yellow light appears on the side mirrors when a car is in your blindspot and, when you're in reverse there is a warning if something is about to pass behind.  

Update- have the car 8 months- 10,000 miles
No mechanical problems.  
Driving this winter, it was really handy to be able to push a button and go into 4 wheel drive.  Twice during snowy, icy weather, I used it on an uphill highway ramp.   The second time, a light on the dash flashed ""4 wheel drive not on"" or something like that--hint, hint.  It gave me instant traction and shuts off around 25 mpg.  The all wheel drive was really excellent the rest of the time. 

Pros   
Roomy.  Decent back seats and plenty of storage area.
Headlights and fog lights great on dark roads
Smooth ride with good feel of the road
Two memory settings for the drivers seat!  I am 5'2"" and everyone has to move my seat.  My 6'2"" husband is comfortable as a passenger.  

Cons
Radio with Sirius is a touch screen-  It takes a lot of attention off the road to change stations or settings and it's impossible to see if the sun is hitting it.  Also there are no preset buttons for the radio.  I can change preset stations (on the touch screen) from the steering wheel but I still have to look down too much to see what is on.  

Short back window so the rear wiper only cleans a small area.  

Overall I'm happy with the car.  I haven't had problems with it so far.

12/17
I ended up trading  this car because I found the controls unsafe. I do mostly highway driving.  The Rav4 had a large busy touch screen that took a lot of attention while driving; not just because of the reflection from sun, but listings of radio stations (I have SiriusXM),  for example were small, and I needed to look down at the screen, even with the steering adjustment.  The heat mode control was in the center and low, with small stick pictures of the heat/def selected.  Also the on/off switch for the blind spot monitor is low on the right of the steering wheel and I accidentally shut it off once getting in with snow pants.  I tried to remember to check that the light was on when I started driving.  There are no dashboard warnings when it and other features, except for traction control, are off or on.  

I wanted a car with all wheel drive and I like all the techie features.  I got a 2017 Impreza Limited with Eyesight because it had a simple touch screen plus a screen on top of the dashboard, in the middle of the windshield, that shows radio info, heat/AC settings, etc. without looking down.   Also dashboard warnings when something is turned off or not working because of weather, etc.   It also has CarPlay, an app you can use with an iPhone and use voice commands (Siri) for navigation, etc.",5 out of 5 stars

Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.

"Jesse, 02/13/20242017ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I bought my 2017 RAV4 XLE AWD brand new in Spring 2017 and it has been a companion to my wife, our dogs, and I for the last 7 years. Sadly, my wife and I decided to trade the amazing RAV4 in today for something bigger (another Toyota mind you), but that was no reflection on the RAV4 whatsoever. In fact, it's an amazing vehicle all around!

After 162,000 I've never had a single mechanical problem with the RAV4. Outside regular maintenance, the engine, transmission,  and everything else has worked flawlessly. We drove thr car from coast to coast, and all over the place over the years (hence the high miles). Still, despite the flawless reliability, the car isn't perfect, although none of the following are enough to warrant one less star in my review. Here are a few minor issues we had in our long term ownership with the RAV4.

Headlight bulbs burned out often: I don't know if this is an electrical issue or what, but I was replacing the headlight bulbs every 12-16 months. Luckily they're easy to replace, but still annoying.

Infotainment is glitchy and temperamental: the infotainment unit is fairly glitchy and would often not show the song playing, or freeze on one song as new ones came up. It also did not play nicely with my old iPod when I still had it and also USB thumb drives with music on it. There were a few times where everything froze for no apparent reason and I literally had to turn the car off and start it back up to resolve. Luckily that didn't happen often, but overall I was not impressed with the infotainment system.

Front seats lost support after a while: this wasn't an issue until the last couple years of ownership, but the front seats, especially the drivers seat got less and less supportive with time. It was bad enough where on longer car trips my lower back, butt, and legs would get very stiff and painful. I never had this issue the first 4 or so years, but I figured it was worth noting if you plan on looking at higher mileage examples. 

Other than those very minor gripes, the 2017 RAV4 is as reliable and well built a vehicle as anyone would hope. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable car and one they can depend on for a very, very long time.",5 out of 5 stars

Our tires (all 4) are cracking near the rim and need to be replaced, with only 20,000 miles on them!)  We compared both the new 2017 Mazda CX-5 and the RAV4 and while both are excellent compact SUVs, my wife preferred the lower dashboard and simpler console of the RAV4, so that's how we went.   The new XLE version is so much quieter than our older 2011 RAV4 and has a much improved ride.  The Entune sound system is likewise deserving of high marks, and even though it doesn't have Apple Car Play, it works seamlessly with both Bluetooth and the lightning/USB connection for music, calls, etc.  Very impressive.   On the mechanical side, the RAV has real good pickup and has kept us in the 30-31 mpg range on our two highway trips thus far.  For an AWD vehicle that's not too shabby!   Overall we are extremely pleased with our purchase. Given Toyota's legendary reliability, we expect to enjoy the RAV4 for quite some time.   Lastly, the only improvements I would recommend for the XLE level would be:  an additional USB port either in the console or in the rear of the console,  the option for heated seats, and  a wider choice of cloth seat and dash colors.

We looked at a new RAV 4 yesterday and you really can't get everything we have one the new models.  Even if you buy their highest price vehicle it still does not match up to our RAV 4 so I am looking at other cars.  Such a shame!!,5 out of 5 stars

You can pay less for an suv but you will not get the build, ride or satisfaction compared to other import brands. Most companies take something of quality out of there cars in order to get the lower price. Honda is a good example of   taking quality out but basically keeping the car the same with little improvement. They may seem different but there foxes with sheeps clothing. The manufacture says they have to break completely before they consider fixing it regardless if it has few miles or not. Toyota stands behind what they sell. Don't buy anything else, consider only leasing them if you don't want to be sorry.",5 out of 5 stars

The lane departure warning, danger warning and emergency situation braking is great.  Negatives: seats are not real leather and are hard, uncomfortable and not ergonomically well-designed resulting in neck and back pain on longer trips or frequent highway travel (limited seat adjustment positions); the cabin space is small and cramped for people 5'8"" (me) or taller; the car is noisy on the highway (poor insulation); the hands-free phone system is mediocre at best; rear-view visibility is poor (fixed on recent models); the car pops out of gear when using the lower gear options and hitting road bumps or depressions; no CarPlay capability (is on more recent models); the hybrid system battery may need to be replaced starting at around 100K miles and may cost around $5000+ to replace.",4 out of 5 stars

"John Boy, 09/29/2017updated04/02/20212017ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","The only reason Toyota gets such high ratings is ""money"". The owners are afraid to complain because it may greatly reduce their bloated resale value. Plus the arrogant Toyota personnel ignore your complaints and deny that anything is wrong ""after all it is a Toyota"". They can take their Toyota and put it where the sun don't shine. Pure media mass manipulation. Specifically; Front vision is not good. hood is not designed well so it is almost impossible to judge distance from an object. Rear visibility is none existent. Getting into the car is a neck breaker, the front widow is at such a tight slope that you have to bend your neck over to almost touch  your shoulder or chest to get your head to fit below the top of the window. It is difficult to find the seat belt it is so flat against the center post and far away that its difficult to grasp it. It is difficult to try to hook up the seat belt because the space between the seat and the accessory is way to tight. Gas mileage is poor.",2 out of 5 stars
"Bob, 09/22/2018updated03/25/20212017ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","This is ""Just a Car"", offering nothing to make it stand out.  We have owned this 2017 RAV4 for 13 months and have 8000 mi on it now.  Wife would look at nothing else, sorry for that now.  I was hoping we would grow to like it more, not so.  It's OK, but you need to look at competition and compare.  Drives well, has only standard safety stuff, interior is not any more than average.  The longer we have it the less we like it.  Too many ""misses"" on what it offers.  Front seats are just average, carpet is cheep and everything sticks in the nap, visibility is not great out over the hood.  Washed the RAV yesterday and find that the aluminum wheels are not easy to clean.  Access to the spokes is limited.  We have 4 cars with aluminum wheels and RAV wheels are the toughest to clean.  Design team probably thought they looked cool, but did not think of maintenance required to clean.  Front seats have limited adjustments.  Driver seat launches you out if it is raised near its maximum.  Passenger seat is too low, only adjustment is fore/aft.  I want to sell now, wife will put up with it.  Review update, well we traded the 2017 Rav for a 2016 Highlander.  We will never go back!  Ya the Highlander is more expensive but it is a lot more car.  Missing the Driver assist features, but not enough to wish we had the RAV.  May consider to trade up to a 2017-2019 Highlander as it does have the Driver assist.  
Sure feel sorry for all of those people that purchased new RAV's when they could have a used Highlander for the same money.  Worth the difference to give up a few years when buying used.  But there are lots of Low mileage Highlanders out there.",3 out of 5 stars

The Rav4 is a great size with room to carry plenty of items and is a smooth ride with AWD (All Wheel Drive).  This is the third one I have had and while I looked hard at other used cars I ended up staying with the RAV4 over other vehicles in the same class. It also good clearance from the ground so in snow, it travels well, and it is high enough above the road to be above any truck spray when I pass them in bad weather. It gets reasonable mileage at 23-28 MPG and Toyotas hold their resale value",5 out of 5 stars

But the transition has been quick and easy.  Our RAV4 moves easily into and out of traffic.  The instrument panel is convenient and easy to read.  The headlights do an amazing job illuminating the streets/highways on both bright and dim.   The ride isn't quite as comfortable as a Camry, but it's close enough that we have been surprised and pleased...our RAV4 is reasonably quiet and comfortable.  We are impressed with the many safety features of of RAV4.  If we had to make a car buying choice again we would definitely buy another RAV4.",5 out of 5 stars
"Papa Craig, 05/20/2017updated12/04/20202017ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","Great car with lots of options...Limited, AWD, with leather, blue tooth, nagi, memory seats, parking assist, hitch ETC. Lots of good safety items on car...that is what sold us on this...traded in 2008 RAV4 Limited with 72000 which had very little safety items (it was a great car with a V-6, AWD).  Toyota seems to be way ahead of the other auto companies when it comes to safety.  We also like the 4 cyl engine and it isn't much different from the 08 V-6 and it does it much better gas milage.
Car is a great driving machine...steering is outstanding, car corners well and it a pleasure to drive.  Style is beyond great...its cool and up to date. Love the hitch and I pull my trailer with yard stuff in it all the time.  Car is quiet and comfortable. Dec 2020 RAV has about 40,000 and new tires...it is even quieter now. Love the car, lots of power and drives nice. Use the hitch on it for the trailer lots of times...RAV is a wonderful vehicle. I like the body style much more then the plain Jane RAV that 
Toyota went to for 2020.   We plan on keeping our RAV for a least another 75000 miles. Nothing has gone wrong with it, interior, sound system, ETC all work great. On highway we get 30-32 miles per gallon...even using the ""sport"" button. Great car.",5 out of 5 stars

Its acceleration was better than i expected. The technology for Blind spot and dynamic cruise control is amazing .Makes long distance driving a pleasure since you dont have to break as often .. this technology allows you to keep up with traffic and eliminate stress while also creating a safe driving experience . Several times when someone cut in front of me -- the car just lowered the speed automatically .

My 3 neatives are : 1) The listed fuel consumption of 8L /100 is totally unrealistic (I am told its achieved on a test bed)
2) It is listed as having a 60 litre tank, but the on-board computer only responds to 40 litres. I have been told by a Toyota Manager that when the computer display shows empty and the red light comes on, there are still 20 litres in the tank, (true but unprofessional).

So, I traded in the 2017 RAV4 for a 2013 Lexus RX 450h that has more head and leg room up front; getting in/out.of the Lexus is MUCH easier and not painful at all for me --- and I still have all of the most important safety features that the RAV4 has.

"Timothy H. Waite, 10/03/2018updated10/03/20192017ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","This vehicle has been great in every area thus far. We have owned it 1 year and have driven it 12,000 miles. Gas mileage ranges between 28 and 31 mpg. The only complaint we have had is that the 17"" Continental tires that came with the vehicle beside being very poor quality are unsafe. The sidewall blew out on the right front while we were on the highway. Praise the Lord we did not have an accident . I went on line and checked Continental tire complaints and found out that we were one of many that have had the same experience. We had to purchase 4 new tires at 12,000 miles as the tread was also fairly low and yes the tire pressure had been checked on a regular basis and they were rotated as they should be. If Toyota wants to keep its good name they need to not worry so much about the bottom line and put quality tires on their vehicle to match the quality of their product. Toyota is not afraid to put a hefty price on their vehicles because they tout their quality, that should extend to tires also. Auto manufactures want top dollar and yet they put the cheapest tires they can find on their products. What is wrong with this picture?",5 out of 5 stars
"Will Rub, 09/22/20192017ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I got a Toyota RAV4 at Findlay Toyota in Henderson, NV for my wife, 2 years ago. When the car had 12K miles it got a weird sound when she pushed the brakes. The service department said it was just dirt in the brake pads and that it would disappear with time. At 14K miles the sound remained, and the service department insisted it was dirt. At 19K miles the sound still was there and the service department said that was a problem with those cars, but the new ones didn't have the problem and that we have to replace the brakes at our own cost. This is unbelievable, they knew the car had that problem, but they just transfer the solution to the customer. We have to pay for their mistakes.
I called Toyota and spoke with a service manager and she just said there was nothing they could do and that if I was not satisfied I could write a bad review, which means they don't care, they just want your money and once they get it you are not their customer anymore.
30 years ago I lived in Colombia, South America, and I got a Toyota Hilux. The car also had problems with the brake system; when I had to stop real fast, the car started spinning (it made about two 360 degrees circles at 65 miles per hour). The story was the same, the customer service department said they didn't know anything about that problem and that I had to pay to solve it. Three years later that car got a recall due to that problem, and the solution  was to replace all the hydraulic hoses for bigger ones, but I already had done that out of my pocket.

The determining factor for her was the comfort and support of the drivers seat and the visability for the driver as she is height challenged.

She loves the way it handles on the road and all of the safety features like the blindspot monitor, warning when you change lanes without signaling or drift out of your lane, and the feature that warns you when vehicles in front of you are getting to close.

That being said, my Escape had more options on it for the price point.  I have never owned a Toyota before and I found the appearance of the RAV4 inviting.  The 2017 RAV4's only offer a 4 cylinder engine, the 2016's offered a 6 cylinder.  The SE comes with the ECO/Sport modes.  ECO I'm getting about 29mpg, Sport mode close to the same, although engine is more peppy in sport mode.  There is plenty of power for merging onto highways and for passing in my opinion.  Interior is quiet and road/engine noise into the cabin is minimal.  The SE's suspension is more stiff, a little more rough than I'd like but ok.  Almost no vehicle lean going around corners, electric steering feels fine also.  Stereo is great!  Cabin speakers more than adequate, better than my Escape's.  The seats are not as comfortable as I would have expected, a bit disappointing!  The headlights and tail lights have the LED trim which looks very nice.  Great visibility at night with just low beams on!  Back seat is spacious, cargo area fine.  The only thing I wish I had is memory button for drivers seat and a power passenger seat.  Other than that it's a nice vehicle, but I only have a little over 550 miles on it so far.

I've had my Rav4 now for 13 months....accumulating 32K miles on it so far.  Here is what I think now about it.  The front cup holders are in terrible locations, I've spilled drinks due to this, very irritating!  The seats , front and back, could use more padding, not comfortable on long drives.  Big problems are night driving, not all buttons are lit!  You better know where they are in the dark!  The dash lights only go so bright, not enough for me...and it appears not for others reviewing this vehicle either.  The steering wheel needs to tilt more and telescope further out. Those are the negatives!  The gas mileage is great for an AWD, I average 27 in the Winter and 29 in the Summer.  Legroom/headroom is very good, I'm 6'-4"" and 260 lbs. and I have no issues.  Cargo space is good also.  It handles very driving in the snow also.  The safety features saved me several times from accidents, and I consider myself an attentive driver.  The LED taillights and bright white headlamps look great, fantastic visibility when driving at night",4 out of 5 stars

Had problems with e-brake as soon as I purchased, took to the dealership THREE times before they agreed to fix it. They told me I didn't know how to engage an e-brake. Very condescending and rude. There was a moldy musty smell in the cabin of the car every time it rained. After months passenger floor was completely soaked through from below. The car continued to develop mold and water, but the dealership denied there was water at all. After 5 months of being told the car was fine, the mold became unbearable and I became sick from driving in it daily. It was finally taken in and the dealership tried to find the cause of the water coming in that was flooding out below the passenger seat and footwell. After 1 month of trying to find the solution they gave up, eradicated the mold and put it back together. After being told by Toyota to go get a lawyer, I did just that and filed a lemon law complaint. The company is now buying  back the car but the process has been horrific. If you are buying a white 2017 Toyota RAV4 used in Southwestern area of PA it could be my lemon that they put back together. You have been warned.",2 out of 5 stars
"Sharon Grace, Friday Harbor, 02/20/20182017ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","Be forewarned!  Test drive this car at night before you buy.  This car is extremely dangerous if you live or drive on unlit narrow, curvy, hilly rural roads at night.   In designing this car's headlights, Toyota has put form over function.  It has packed the RAV4 with all kinds of safety features, including numerous airbags.  You will need them, since you cannot safely see to drive at night.   The IIHS rates the headlights as ""marginal,"" and states that on curves the high beams are inadequate in all 4 tests conducted.  At night with the headlights on, the lack of illumination is dangerous.  The top half of the windshield appears dark as if it has black frost on it.  You can see through only the lower half of the windshield, which has limited visibility through which you can see straight ahead, but have little peripheral visibility. Going down hills cuts the visibility considerably, at times to as little as 50 feet.  Sharp turns to the left or right are blind.  Toyota refuses to fix the problem, since the headlights are ""working as designed.""  Great--a design defect.  Wish we had known.  We have had 3 Toyotas previously, which we loved.  We love this one during the day.  Too bad we can't drive it safely at night.",1 out of 5 stars

The RAV4 has made astonishing improvements to the RAV4 since the early 2000s when my brother-in-law owned one.   Stylish, modern, high tech and smooth ride.   The 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine mated to a 6 speed  transmission provides good performance.  It's good on fuel and with Toyota offering 0% APR for 60 months what a deal.   It was too good to pass up.  This is my fourth Toyota and Toyota has consistently proved to be reliable vehicles.

I have driven my 2017 Toyota RAV4 XLE FWD for a little over  a year now and I  have to say overall I am 
extremely pleased with this compact-crossover SUV. It rides quite and smooth with good acceleration.  
The instument panel is layed out well. There is ample room to seat five persons comfortably. My fuel bill is 
reduced almost in half compared to my previous Toyota (4Runner). The new features I like are the backup camera,
bluetooth, LDA (lane detection alert) and push button to open and close the liftgate. The bluetooth is a 
magnificent invention. With the bluetooth I am to connect my iPhone and listen my favorite tunes and use the

Very far features from Toyota Camry LE 2011 and Camry LE 2014.

I am very disappointed with Toyota. I bought Toyota Camry 2011 brand new - excellent car, great ride and very reliable. I bought  another Toyota Camry 2014 brand new- semi excellent car. Reliable but 2011 Camry was better. I am a Toyota loyalist!!!
So bought another Toyota this time a 2017 RAV4.  This car is so bad and way far below from 2 Toyota Camry's that I have bought from 2011.  This is the ugliest and worst features a Toyota car that I have. 

 From a new owners point of view, I wish I did not buy this and I will not buy another Toyota anymore. Not recommend Toyota to my friends.

Last service experience 2017 at Toyota Auto nation for my 2014 Toyota.  Just came in to replace one tire that had a puncture
At the left front tire and an oil and filter change. Seems simple for one hour job!

All my four tires were still good and still had a lot of traction and treads on all my four tires. Instead I was being sold by Oscar to buy four new Michelin tires for about $755 installed.  I felt there was something fishy and untrue to what he was saying about my tires. He was very insistent to sell the new tires. Something dishonest so I declined.

Instead of a mere 1 hour for an oil and filter change it took almost 3 hours and I wondered what they were doing? Oscar told me they were fixing it.  

Guess what, after I declined to buy tires from Oscar, after waiting 3 hours, when I returned home
I found the left front tire that had a puncture was now in the left rear and I found the 3 other new tires that I had
Has been replaced by Toyota with 3 old tires with very minimum tire treads. 

What a service. What a disappointment. What a dishonesty. What a bunch of thieves. I lost sleep over it and I am sure they will deny it so what's the point of dealing with dishonest service shop.  So I went to another shop to buy all four new tires aligned and installed for only $640. I was very happy with this shop. I was very angry with Toyota and will never buy from them again.",1 out of 5 stars

The emergency brake system will beep you, however, the PCS will not reduce or stop for you.  At night, it gets worse, the radar will not detect vehicle in front of you most of the time.  If a vehicle in front of you is moving forward even an one mph, and you are approaching at low or high speed, the Toyota PCS will not even warn you.  The PCS beeps under several conditions only:  the vehicle in front of you is complete stop position, and it has to be daytime, if you are approaching at about 20 mph, the pcs will sometimes beeps you about within 20 - 25 feet away from the vehicle in front of you, which in real world, the distance and the reaction time to take action may be too short for the average people to react and it won't avoid collision. The rear vent A/C panel is located on front dashboard, very inefficient, most of other automakers rear vent a/c is located by rear side of center console compartment.  The master window switch compartment has only one button is illuminated; the driver side, all other has no lights, makes hard to find switches at night time.  The flooring material is made of cheap fabric, feels like made of thin cardboard like material, easy to ripped off and not durable.  The led headlight is not brighter than regular halogen bulb.  I do not see any advantage of led brightness.  The interior such as dashboard and overall design is made of hard plastic and overall interior quality is below average, compare to Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, Subaru Forester, Mazda CX-5, Hyundai Tucson and etc....

So from that POV on a recent trip I rented a Toyota RAV4 for an two week hiking trip in the Northwest to Mt Hood, Mt Rainer and Mt Olympia; I would be traveling on a number of dirt back roads and wanted an SUV.  Lets start with the positive.  The vehicle was new... it had less the 5 k miles and still had the new car smell.  The storage was more than adequate for our back country gear.  The AC was good and the controls were generally intuitive except for the A/B Odometer control.  Now for what I did not like.  Even though this is an AWD vehicle it drives like a FWD vehicle; the torque steer is quite noticeable on acceleration.  The handling is very vague not crips like I'm use to with the Subaru's I've driven; cornering at speed can be disconcerting.  Braking is fine.  Many speak of the advantage of the height of an SUV but I found the nose of the RAV4 hiding what was directly in front of me.  Now the rear view camera was a disappointment; the guidelines superimposed on the image were off and placed my too close to surrounding vehicles.  As for the transmission, I found myself having to manually set the gear on back roads because it was constantly switching between gears or lacked need power to get up the steep inclines.

Not sure why so of the reviews say RAV4 lacks power it’s an SUV to me it has enough power you not going out and racing it.  Don’t base your purchase on a company’s review but base it on the consumers review and go out and test drive for yourself.  I am getting 30 miles to the gallon on the highway with ac running full blast and temps outside at 100 plus.  Around town I’m getting 25-27.  Yes, the RAV4 doesn’t have any rear air vent but believe me when I say it doesn’t need them.  It has one in the center dash that blows straight to the rear and this AC is the coldest Ac I have ever had in a car and I have owned Chevy, Old’s, Fords, Subaru, Hondas and Kia’s.

Pros - I love Most of them that Toyota delivered and love the safety systems
Cons: - 
- Driver seat is not as good as even 2011 Camry Hybrid that I had. With in few days I started getting neck pain, Checked with few other RAV4. Toyota seriously need to redesign. 99.9% people I checked on this were never able to rest their head.
- Wrong location for USB drive that always in the way when you try to use cell phone area that Toyota reserved, So you have every chance to knock it out, over the period, USB port become useless due to accidental pushes
- I was wondering why did Toyota allow about 25% size black spot when we view dashboard screen of front view camera ? That is just hides the object in front you that surprise you anytime
- As one of the owner said on bottom of doors inside that catches dirt, its true and am trying keep it clean all the time and every wash. 
- Rainy days... Yes, you can see the water drop on your dashboard screen that are in front/review view camera. We know you Toyota, you can do the better job and solution to it.
- Rear seats belt buckles are not Kids friendly as they search through every time as its too short and hidden inside the seat.
- Do not know the reason that Toyota is not installing the Rear View Side mirror cover trim. It looks obvious that something is missing on them.
- Toyota did a great job on 2011 Camry Hybrid breaks that you never feel the break shoe vibration on your break paddle, But in RAV4, you feel them as 90s Car.
- as other owner said, Sound level is high in RAV4 than my Camry.
- Toyota's Maps - Rerouting is not that speedy as it takes a full minute to reroute.
- Audio - I used Browse to select a category and played, I could not come out to root to play all songs until I reinserted. Needs the Audio folder view menu to be added.",3 out of 5 stars

I had the brakes and rotors replaced last year. The battery was replaced 2 years ago. That's it. Nothing has broken. I service the car every 5,000 miles religiously. I change wipers, air filter, and cabin filter once a year. I took it last month to the Toyota dealer to have the transmission fluid changed. Never believe that crap that they are sealed units and never to change the transmission fluid. That's a lie. Then, when the transmission fails due to lack of service, your faced with thousands of dollars for a replacement. Trust me, have your Toyota transmission serviced. 
I bought my silver 2018 Rav4 XLE as a certified pre owned unit. I've owned it for 2 years now and it has been flawless. Nothing has broke. Only things I've replaced has been the battery, front brake pads, filters and wipers. I average 26-27mpg city. Seats are very comfortable. The CD stereo sounds great. The Toyota safety sense system is amazing. Parking sensors, radar cruise, lake keep assist. Power liftgate. Sunroof. I also have a older 04 Corolla LE that I use on more mundane tasks since is more fuel efficient, being a smaller car of course. But for long trips and most comfort I love my Rav4. Is the best SUV I've ever owned. I recommend it.",5 out of 5 stars

"John, 01/21/2023updated01/29/20242018ToyotaRAV4SE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","I bought this car used but with low mileage two years ago.  The car is dependable, low cost maintenance, decent mileage and is an attractive vehicle.  The problem I noticed right away is the interior noise.  It's as if Toyota did nothing to soundproof the cabin.  I would have appreciated  a little more shoulder and leg room.  The car has decent acceleration and is very good on ice and snow.

Mostly what the RAV4 lacks is pizzaz.  When it first came on the scene it had pizzaz, it had a presence, a unique style. You'd look at the car and want to drive it.  None of that is true with the 2018 model.

I'm sure that it will run forever as many Toyotas do, but it won't be any more exciting then than it is now, and that's unfortunate.",3 out of 5 stars

After talking to several mechanics, they had very positive things to say about the 2018 model year. It's the last year Toyota included the rock-soild 8 speed automatic transmissions before they switched to CVTs in the next model year. That amazing 8-speed automatic coupled with the really reliable 2.5L engine means you'll be trading slightly worse MPGs than other SUVs of time, but you do get the power, solid shifting, and immediate response in return, just an incredible pairing. The interior isn't flashy, or extremely comfortable, but it is well built and made with some robust materials.

I was into the dealership to look at our options.  When he calculated the blue book value of mine in front of me, it came in only $2000 less than what it was listed at in 2018.
Combine that with spending $80-$100 a month less on gas than I would have with a non-hybrid, I'm actually gaining on this investment, which for any kind of new car ownership is usually impossible.
I will most certainly buy out the vehicle when the lease is up, as we have been completely happy with it's performance and comfort.  It also has 20hp more than a non hybrid.",5 out of 5 stars

I shopped almost every dealership in Houston and the average price they were quoted me drive out was in the range of 24 to Mid 25. so the price of $21,781 wasn't too bad for full drive out price. I financed with my credit union, shell, and I got $250 back from them by financing it through shell. I hope this help somebody out there who's looking for a car believe me it pays to shop around online and email quotes. I don't know if it helps any but the place I got it from was Joe Meyers.   not really plugged for them because I've quoted them before in the past and they were higher than everybody else. Good luck on your shopping. On a personal note I would have preferred the Honda CR-V but it was like $3,000 more expensive.

UPDATE:  After 3 years now driving it.  Me giving an update at this point would not really be fair.   To be honest it is not really driven very much.  It only has 5k miles after sll this time.  Still has new car smell.

I do have one complaint.  A button on the top by the rear view mirror broke.  Looks to be defective.  Went ahead and glued it back to avoid taking it in to dealer and comming back.  Was not worth my time.

But it does drive very smooth.  Large room inside.  Much more than my CR-V.  

The reliability of a Toyota, I would suggest if you can find and afford one.  It would be a good investment in a great quality car.  Last for years.  You would buy several cars before this one totally breaks down.",5 out of 5 stars

The keyless entry system works well. The power operated tailgate is a bit slow but works well. Unfortunately, the headlights are halogen and not LEDs as my 17' Corolla. I have taken a few trips in my new for me RAV4 and I am so pleased with the quietness, ride, and overall solid feel of the SUV. The 4cyl engine has enough power for this SUV.

My RAV4 color is shinny Silver outside and all black interior. I love the paint quality and how shines when freshly washed. As negatives, I have 2 complaints. First is the radio unit. I have the CD player unit with XM radio but no navigation. The Bluetooth constantly drops and keeps disconnecting my phone while I am on a call. I've read online that this is a known issues with Toyota's radio units. This sound system is weak with low bass and volume power compared to my previous Corolla. Also, I have a XM free trial active and whoever designed this radio should be fired. How can you have XM radio and no way to scroll through the stations from the steering wheel controls? I have to stretch my arm all the way to the tuning knob on the head unit to scroll through hundreds of channels while trying to drive. And my second complaint is the front windshield.

I apply RainX on all my vehicles and this is the first time I see that water just ""stays"" and doesn't repel. I got new wipers and fresh coat of RainX and the water just moves side to side and smears all over the glass. I keep using the wipers and it never gets dry. Always leaves a film and streaks of water.

I enjoyed the backup camera which was very clear and the tech was adequate. My only complaint was the gas mileage was pretty average (was getting 21 MPG combined city/highway).

The sound quality of the entertainment system is quite good. The fm radio sound quality is not very good The seats are comfortable and firm. The first 5 plus years of ownership has been trouble free, something I have come to expect from a Toyota. I wish the car had (at this trim level) heated mirrors and an inside the car & remote control rear hatch release.  Mechanically the vehicle has been flawless for over two years.

The engine sound is more pronounce than you would expect but after test driving a few, it probably grown into me that I don't notice the sound when I accelerate. I have my RAV4 for almost a month now and I barely notice the engine sound. I chose the word sound and not noise because it doesn't sound unpleasant to me. Mix gas mileage average at 34 mpg and 38 on highway. I took it for a ride up on a mountain winding road and I don't see any issues accelerating and down shifting going down the winding road. One issue that I've notice is sometimes on a rolling stop, if I step on the gas a little bit harder than I should, the engine will jerk.

23,000 miles after and I don't see any issues with my RAV4. The noise people complain about when accelerating is distance sound for me now. I've learned to drive and timed my acceleration as well on a rolling stop that will avoid the jerk movement. Buying another RAV in the near future for the wife.

I purchased the Rav4 without driving it on the highway. 
1) It is so noisy you cannot communicate with others in this car.  Motor noise during acceleration (as you enter the freeway) is excessive. It would be acceptable if this was diminished at freeway speeds but, this is not the case.  It is really noisy on the road.
2) The lane center feature is unusable. It seems to be overly sensitive.  And, the “lane keep” feature is unavailable unless the “lane center” feature is selected.
I plan to trade this off, as soon as I am financially able. 

Update: I’ve had the car just over a year and have 10,000 miles on it. It is now a love / hate relationship. I still very much dislike the noise on the road.

"Adam, 04/13/2020updated09/13/20212019ToyotaRAV4Adventure 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","To start with, I must admit that I’m dumbstruck by all the negative reviews on here. A lot of people seem to inadequately research and test their vehicles before buying. Minor niggles turn into 1-star reviews on here and “I’ll never buy Toyota again” threats. Isolated warranty claims yield bad reviews, also.
I’ll start by saying that the transmission lurching problem has had a fix since August 2019. Since, my transmission has been near-flawless. It seems to be, along with the Adventure’s transfer case, the only widespread problem. For the latter, Toyota has gotten around to replacing them (they had exceptional delays for parts, in early-to-mid-2019). My Toyota dealership and Toyota at the corporate level have been fantastic. For those who are looking for a new RAV4, this means 2020 models don’t have these problems.
The engine is a bit unrefined, granted, but it isn’t a deal-breaker (I had noticed before purchasing the vehicle that it was very loud while accelerating, but it’s one of the only foibles this car has, IMO). It also isn’t turbocharged like some rivals, so it’ll be more durable and less pricey to maintain. It’s more powerful than most, but if it’s too slow for some, there’s the Hybrid and Prime, although I’ve never yearned for more power and our other vehicle is quicker and more powerful.
I must say that I’m impressed with Toyota’s new vehicle designs. The RAV4 Adventure is handsome, and my car’s two-tone Blue Flame on Ice Edge (white) roof turns heads.
I thought I’d talk about the supposedly cheap-looking and feeling cabin. In the LE, it’s the case, but as you go up the ladder, material quality is better. It’s a solid, well-assembled cabin. I also like its “tough” look, and the orange elements in the Adventure trim.
Adaptive Cruise Control and the other active safety features are amongst the best I’ve experienced. Sure, you can’t turn ACC into regular cruise control, but it’s the same with most car manufacturers. I only know of Volvo that gives the option. Lane-keeping and centering, when the lane marking are visible, works very well, too. I’ve only had to use automatic emergency braking once (thankfully), but it really works!
I haven’t had problems with the infotainment system. It’s large and within easy reach. It works well, although it’s slightly slow. I’ve never had a problem connecting to Apple CarPlay (that I use most of the time).

Overall, I love my RAV4 Adventure. It’s handsome and pleasant to drive, while being very spacious and comfortable, and has a well-laid-out interior. Fuel economy is competitive. It also should have an exceptional resale value and has respectable maintenance costs. 

Update (December 2020) : My opinion of this vehicle, that I’ve had nearly 2 years and 20 000 miles, hasn’t changed. I still appreciate it, and I haven’t had any other problems. 3 friends and family members now have a RAV4 in their driveway. It is still, in my opinion, one of the best vehicles in its segment, for the above reasons. For those that may be discouraged by all these reviews, keep in mind that this is the best-selling non-pickup in the country. Reliability-wise, the current-generation CR-V has fared far worse. It is currently subject to 2 lawsuits over serious defects. If, however, you don’t want a RAV4, I’d recommend the Kia Sportage. The current generation model is quieter inside the cabin, is well-built and has so far proven reliable. My mother and sister, that have a 2018 (with 40 000 miles) and a 2020 model (with 8 000 miles), respectively, have had no problems whatsoever. They’ve only had to go to the dealer for scheduled maintenance.

I hope this will help you make a better-informed choice.",5 out of 5 stars
"Ted in VT, 09/05/2019updated09/09/20212019ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","Thought we'd make the move from Camrys to this little crossover SUV for it's safety features.  The safety features are impressive.  What isn't impressive is the road, engine and wind noise.  The ride is a little on the rough side as well.  Add to that a rattle noise in the steering column or instrument panel that comes and goes depending on speed and road surface.  Another surprise issue is a case of torque steer that occurs when hitting the gas aggressively while passing.  This causes the vehicle to pull to the right, toward the vehicle you are passing.
On the plus side, the interior is pretty decent for a vehicle in this price class.  The addition of rubber tray type floor mats is a nice touch for those of us living in New England or other snowy places.  The mileage is decent.  On long road trips with the car loaded we can get up to 34 mpg when driving in ECO mode.
Overall, I'm unimpressed with this vehicle and probably would not purchase another RAV4 unless improvements are made to remedy the issues mentioned.  Toyota should consider shifting some of their TV advertising budget over to quality improvement.

Now, two years into ownership, the same problems or dislikes still exist.  I did narrow the rattle down to somewhere in the steering column, but have yet to find a cure - very annoying.  I will add that the the expansive front windshield and expansive black dashboard top surface make a great solar heating source.  The car gets very hot on sunny summer days which can challenge the air conditioner.

September 2021 - finally found the rattle location, where the top of the ateering wheel meets a cowling in front of the steering wheel.  Made a plastic “wedge” to insert there and it stopped the annoying rattle.  The large black dashboard top creates a lot of heat on sunny days.  Very poor idea to have that large an expanse of black surface.  It's like riding in a dutch oven on sunny days.  I would not buy another RAV4 with a black interior and a very large windshield.",3 out of 5 stars

"Bill, 08/01/2019updated08/05/20212019ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I purchased my new 2019 Toyota RAV4 Limited FWD, not a hybrid 25 months ago and I have been fully retired for the last 7 months and not driving as much having only 16,500 miles on my odometer.  My overall mpg is 28.2 mpg with mostly city driving in short distance trips of about 20 minutes and when I take long trips between Slidell Louisiana and Birmingham Alabama it gets 33.5 mpg. Engine noise is average, but road noise is disappointing considering the cost of this vehicle. My RAV4 is garage kept and well maintained and always looks like it just came out of a showroom. I have not had any problems with the power train or electronic systems. The navigation system maps are original design and Toyota has not released any updates for the maps since 2018 for my vehicle that does not have an SD slot. I mentioned the map situation since my vehicle cannot get me to the new New Orleans International Airport that was relocated in 2020. The Entune 3.0 Entertainment and Information system receives updates via the cloud automatically when released. The acceleration is average and all the safety systems are outstanding. Comfort in the front and rear seating is very good.  I downgraded my initial rating because of the road noise and Toyota not providing the means to update maps. My Android cell phone interfaces with the vehicle perfectly except it does not work with apple car play like my wife’s apple phone that can link current maps using that method. I have a trakfone costing me $120 a year and her apple iPhone cost her more than that per month.",4 out of 5 stars
"Moe, 07/25/20212019ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)",2.5 liters should give you a good feel when you accelerate but not with rav 4. Excessive engine noise is another issue. Cheap plastic parts. Seats are not comfortable at all and starting a make noise with in first year of use. Touch screen is not very responsive after few weeks and streeing mounted buttons and door buttons are for day use only as they don't light up in the dark you have to train your brain to learn them. Only thing is it's good on gas. Smooth ride. And a few safty features keep your insurance low some times. And oil change cost is low.,2 out of 5 stars

"Becky, 07/14/20212019ToyotaRAV4Adventure 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I also had the grinding and mooing sound in my RAV4 Adventure. I took it to the dealer who fixed it, and 6000 miles later it started again.  Toyota sent a 125K mile warranty for the part that causes the issue, but I don't want to go to the dealer every 6000 miles and have to prove to them that it's making the sound again before they fix it.  Also the traction control is starting to go out.  I also thought the transmission was jerky and slow to react.  It would pause when accelerating from a stop before taking off - annoying and dangerous.  It doesn't have the CVT transmission like a lot of newer cars, making for a more old-fashioned drive.  I also felt like I was driving a big, slow tank. There is a range of VINs to avoid if you're buying this car, that are impacted by the grinding problem.  Check out the service bulletins online - they list the range.  I'd at least avoid those, but would not recommend this vehicle, in general.  It's not good quality.  I usually buy and keep cars for 10 years.  I had to get rid of this one after only one year.  First and last Toyota for me.",1 out of 5 stars
"Bad transmission, 07/06/2019updated07/12/20212019ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I bought a new 2019 rav 4 on April of 2019.  I didn’t notice it during the test drive, but it jerks and hesitates at pull off from stop signs and red lights.  The transmission is faulty.  Do not buy.

I’m updating this review.  About a year later in July of 2020, after I purchased the 2019 RAV4, I called the Toyota dealership again to see if they found a fix for the issue with the transmission.  The dealership never acknowledged that the transmission had an issue that they were aware of.  I explained  to the dealership again that so many people on all of these different websites have put their reviews about the transmission on the RAV4 so how do you not know about it… They still said that they had no known recall on it and for me to call Toyota customer service.  

While on the phone with them, I had already found an article that was very very reputable and it laid out the issue and the resolution and so I explained to them that the issue has been addressed in this article and the resolution has been addressed and that I wanted them to fix it and so they had no choice but to fix it.  

When I called Toyota customer service, they too pretended as though they had no clue of the issue or the resolution.

Basically the tech had to re-calibrate the electronic control module (ECM). I bought the car in Apr of 2019 but they didn’t fix it until July of 2020.  They only fixed it because I forced them too. 

I sold the car with 22K miles on it.  Bottom line is that Toyota didn’t care.

"Bill, 08/25/2019updated03/08/20212019ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I bought my 2019 RAV4 XLE last April and regret that decision every day I have to drive it. When accelerating from - 0 - to 40 mph, the engine screams like a banshee. That would be fine if I was driving a Shelby Cobra, but not a RAV4. When turning corners, there is a hesitation when you press on the accelerator that feels like the engine is about to die. I try to counteract the screaming engine by listening to music with the volume level cranked up to 40 and/or taking about 20 seconds to get up to 30 from a dead stop. Although the latter method will usually result in other drivers honking or giving me the one finger salute. I have purchased 12 new cars/trucks in my lifetime (many used ones) and the 2019 RAV4 ranks second from the bottom. It’s edged out by a Hyundai Tiburon I purchased for my daughter about 15 years ago, which was a real lemon. I did test drive the RAV4, but the sales rep talking all the time distracted me somewhat from the engine noise issue. I did mention something about it, but grossly underestimated how much of a problem it would be in the long run. I wished I had shopped around more and test drove a few other models like the Honda CR-V and the Nissan Rogue. About the only positive thing I can say about the ‘19 RAV4 is that I like the way it looks, both inside and out. It also has some excellent safety features, including a warning signal when you are backing out if there are cars approaching you from any direction. If I had it to do over again, I definitely  would not purchase this vehicle.",2 out of 5 stars

"JOCO, 02/05/20212019ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","My main complaint with this vehicle is the infotainment system - which is app-based. The car does not come standard with GPS - you have to use the app called Scout which gives terrible directions and inaccurate timings. Everything is app-based, therefore you need unlimited on your phone. Then, if you have no phone signal, nothing works. Half the time when the Toyota decides to do an update it stops connecting to your phone. It is not Android Auto or Apple Auto based, so it truly is absolute crap!
The car itself, drives fine, also when needing to get up to speed quickly it sounds like you’re killing it. It is very economical though

About 25 miles on the odometer.  It was returned the next day where it has been in the shop ever since (over 3 weeks and counting)  awaiting parts.  It was diagnosed as a bad O2 sensor but there are none available anywhere in the US right now.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 for having only driven it to the dealership and back is the toyota service has been very good in honoring their warrantee.  They gave me a brand new rental from Enterprise and are covering incidental costs from having to pay for parking (employee parking sticker is only valid for car registered in my name).  This is my first Toyota branded car.  Right now I'm wondering if I should have bought the CR-V instead.  

Update:  3 years later and 77,000 miles later, this car has been very good.  I do a lot of highway driving and the one thing keeping it from 5 stars is the road noise.  I've replaced the tires with Michelin's best to try to keep it quieter in the cabin.  As you get to 65+ mph, you WILL have to increase the volume on your stereo.  And at 75, you will have to increase it A LOT!  This is a very reliable, useful, and fun car to own.  City driving is perfect.  Highway driving is fine for driving but not so much for talking on the phone or listening to music.  A little more care in the sound proofing would have made it 5 stars.",4 out of 5 stars

Highs: Nice road manners, quite once at speed, comfortable and attractive interior, large storage capacity*. Ventilated seats (I live in the desert). Radar cruise control.
Lows: Transmission acts more like a CVT, indecisive gear selections. Engine is very harsh and noisy while getting to cruising speed. Rear view mirror is nauseating in camera mode and worthless at night- luckily it can be turned off. Lane safety feature is overly sensitive and picks up road repairs, constantly battling the car trying to steer itself-luckily it can be turned off. Other than the radar cruise control, safety features seem more gimmicky than useful.

Having driven a little over 1000 miles so far, I’m favorably impressed.  I actually wanted to buy the hybrid version but after several months I couldnt find the color combination I wanted and the dealers were marking the price up over MSRP.  Toyota has seemed to address the two issues I was concerned about, which was engine noise and low-speed shifting of the 8-speed transmission.  Extra sound-proofing has been added to the engine compartment and a TSB has was implemented in August and the transmission seems to shift fine for me.  In a combination of city and highway driving I’m only getting 28 mpg from the gas motor, so the 35 mpg highway seems optimistic.  I have the tech pkg which includes the birds eye view cameras which help in parking...it also includes the phone charging pad but I need to upgrade my iPhone 6 for it to work...the camera in the rear view mirror is useful if your cargo area is full and you want to see behind you.  The car is loaded and has the weather pkg, which I really like the heated steering wheel on cold days.
July 2022 update:  I’ve now put 10,600 miles on the Rav4 and the car continues to be fun-to-drive and reliable.  The local Toyota dealer has done both of the free services (e.g. oil/filter change and tire rotation at 5k and 10k miles approximately).  I did have the TSB applied for the firmware and DCM software upgrade which solves a problem that can drain the 12v battery.  The dealer checked the battery at the same time and said it was “o.k.”, but I was getting low readings on my own analysis of the battery and had to charge it for 5 hours to get it to close to normal charge voltages.  Subsequently I replaced the OEM battery with a new Duracell AGM-type battery that I had more confidence in.",4 out of 5 stars

So the positives are I find the seats comfortable, it has good standard safety tech and the hybrid powertrain is nice. 

But, The non hybrid powertrain is noisy and lacks refinement. The 8 speed automatic isn’t responsive in some scenarios and can have rough shifts. Lots of wind noise at highway speeds which gets annoying. Infotainment is starting to look dated. Base sound system is terrible, and the interior quality and materials is subpar.  

I find it cheap that for around $30k Toyota couldn’t give us alloy wheels and a leather wrapped steering wheel on the LE trim. Overall it feels and drives like a cheap suv.

The car was less than a year old when the issues started with the Battery draining.  They keep blaming it on everything but the car battery.  They say I don't drive it enough and I asked what was enough as I drive it daily to work.  They said I probably use the GPS and my phone and all of the technology too much.  That is quite absurd as I don't even own a cell phone and usually just use the radio.  I think it is time for Toyota to recall these cars and get the Battery updated.  You can't even be sure if your car will start in the morning, so my family has to wait to make sure I can start the newest car on the driveway before they can leave.

"Shawn, 07/01/20212020ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I want to start this review by stating that I owned a 2018 Rav 4 LE which I loved for the most part. I loved the spacious cabin. I loved the comfy bucket seats in the back. I loved the comfy seats in the front. I traded in the for the (more luxurious model?) 2020 Rav 4 xle. The first thing that I noticed was how much less head room you have in the driver's seat, but figured that I would get used to it. A month later I rode in the passenger seat and I wondered how a tall person could even sit in the passenger seat due the positioning of the seat in the car, with no way to lower it. After taking it on a long trip, I realized that the old LE had MUCH more comfy seats. Also, my passengers in the back seat now have a much less luxurious ride in bench seat that sits straight up, is not adjustable and is hard as a rock! Also, for those that say this car is noisy. It has a very loud acceleration. The lane assist will pull you very hard for no reason at time. Now- the things that I do love about the 2020 Rav. The seats are vinyl and therefore very easy to wipe clean and keep nice looking. I also love the new LED screen. The whole front dash seems much nicer. The visibility is higher. The new exterior body design is AMAZING, (this is what sold me).Of course I also love the moonroof which comes standard in the 2020 xle. I like how the RAV 4 handles hills.I have noticed that the paint on this model is not road rashing the way that the 2018 RAV 4 was, but I went from a glossy black to a metallic silver, so I believe that this is likely the difference.",3 out of 5 stars

Later I noticed the screen on the JBL system that would glitch and turn black on me. The volume knob stops working occasionally. One day I opened my moonroof and when I arrived at my destination, I attempted to close it and it would not close at all. I also have the Toyota care app that lets you start/stop and open/close your doors, during the winter when I needed it the most it would not connect or work at all. I took the vehicle in for service at Toyota Hodgkin in IL. They told me the system needed a software upgrade but failed to ever mention that to me until I brought it in personally. I recorded several of the issues I was experiencing and was glad I did. Finally they tell me my car is ready and as I was driving out of the dealership lot I tested the vehicle. My moonroof was still messed up. I left the vehicle there and was given a loaner. When I returned they were unable to completely solve the issue with the moonroof and told me to bring it back when I return for my 10k service. Today I go to start my car to get to work, the battery is completely dead. I was late for work, had to get a ride and when I returned late at night I had to call road side for a jump start. The person they sent out to jumpstart my car related to me that they get several calls for the 2020 hybrids about the vehicles not starting. I have never had my car sitting for more than a day so I don’t see why this is happening and the car is only a year old.

The only difference in options that were not on our new Toyota Rav 4 was the automatic back hatch and the built in garage door opener. We wanted the Ruby Pearl Flare and the one the dealer had everything on it but the options mentioned. The automatic hatch is definitely a necessity. Overall great vehicle with unbelievable highway gas mileage. Don't pass this vehicle.up!,5 out of 5 stars

I had to get a battery charger to get the car to function. I took the car to the dealership and was told I needed a firmware update and it was free for now since the car is under warranty. Also, my engine cover was half missing and they claimed it was due to animal damage. I saw no evidence of animals, and I searched several times and found nothing. However, the technician magically found animal feces. Of course it's not covered under warranty.",1 out of 5 stars

It has the following  poor design faults.
1) The Limited model has 14 control switches for heating/cooling is a total waste, way too complex and the printing on the switches is too small to read. Difficult to use.

2) No storage space, can’t store anything else within the spare tire space either. Side pockets are basically useless for practical storage use.

3) Video rearview mirror has vibration while driving that makes this expensive feature totally worthless, it’s a gimmick, not at all practical.

4) Hard plastic located on sides of drivers seating position makes it uncomfortable on the sides of drivers knees. The door handles are too large and hit your knees, the driving area is very cramped.",3 out of 5 stars

It sat for a couple hours and it is dead again.  The car is under 12 months old therefore, it should NOT have a dead battery.  There is something defective with this 2020 car battery.  In addition, the cloth tan seats stain very easily, even water leaves a stain. These are the poorest quality upholstery ever.  Finally, the three seats in the back always trigger the fasten seat belt light even if nothing is on the seat.

"Evan, 03/18/20212020ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","We have had many Toyota models over the years in my family going back to the 1980's. I am familiar with the brand and many of it's models. We, like many others came to love the company for their long-term reliability and impeccable craftsmanship, although after driving this one I may have to examine some of those points on the new vehicles. Recently I took a road trip from Southern Colorado to Tennessee. I have a 2004 Low Mileage Avalon XLS as my personal car at this time, but I didn't wanna put the wear and tear on it, so I rented a 2020 Rav4 XLE FWD. I drove the car for 8 days and approx. 3,100 miles. 

I liked the room and the high seating position. However, I am 6'5"" and found the bottom seat cushion really uncomfortable after a few hours. The cushion is too short. I had virtually no thigh support. I did stop and buy a butt pillow made for a car and that helped a little bit, but the 16 year old seats in my Avalon are better by far. I would think that in a 2020 model, Toyota would know how to make a supportive seat. The power adjustments were ok, but the lack of thigh support really affected me. I also don't like this new cheaper upholstery they use. Seems like it would be harder to clean than velour used to be. 

The infotainment screen kept freezing intermittently. Got tired of dealing with it and just used my bose bluetooth speaker and kept it in the passenger seat. Makes me kind of miss old radios a bit. When the technology is not reliable it is downright hazardous. Someone with less patience and driving experience would easily get into an accident while trying to fiddle with this crappy device. 

The car is very loud. My word is it loud. I get that this is a utility vehicle and not an Avalon or a Lexus. But the 2002 CR-V my company owns as a business vehicle is quieter on the highway. The engine just sounded very thrashy and noisy, not really what one would expect from Toyota. The vibrations and road noise from the tires weren't much better. I rented in November of 2020. Vehicle was manufactured in May and had 9,300 Miles on it when I had possession of it. Just didn't seem overall like what I would come to expect from an ""XLE"" trim level from any Toyota model. The XLE is supposed to be usually top of the line, but I know that it has moved mid range to base on some models in recent years, but still. A fairly disappointing package overall. Hard plastic door panels and a stark black interior that drive home the point that Toyota is becoming somewhat unremarkable. I was starting to suspect this when I beheld the very cheap 2008 Corolla years ago, but this vehicle really confirms it. The cargo space was wonderful and with rear seat down, almost cavernous. Probably the best feature of this vehicle. 

I didn't really calculate my exact MPG on the trip, but I stopped infrequently enough for gas that I was happy. MPG didn't seem like it was too terrible. Another pro I suppose. That made up for the lack of power the 2.5L engine seemed to have. Had to really punch it to pass at times on the freeway. 

Overall the Rav4 comes across as a mediocre rental. I can only imagine what a buyer with remorse must be feeling. It really kind of feels about on par in some ways with the Ford Explorer of 2001-2005 ish. Decent, passable transport that doesn't offend or delight really, but also lacks any meaningful refinement or touches. Toyota has proven that they are now about on par with Ford of 20 years ago. I have also read a few things about these vehicles having a fire risk. One that Toyota still has not determined the cause of. I guess after reading some of these other reviews about the Rav4, I should also be glad it started every time while I had it. 

My final verdict would have to be that this is nothing special overall. I certainly wouldn't buy one after renting one.",2 out of 5 stars

However, although many improvements have been made to the 2020 model, one area of concern is the cargo support base (the cover that hides the spare tire and lets you pile stuff on top).  The manufacturer and the engineer must have used different tape measures since the base has about a 1/3"" gap on the side.  This causes the platform to fall onto the spare tire.  Be warned if you carry anything that has liquid, when it falls you are left with a mess to clean up.  Bad design and how quality control missed this is not what Toyota is known for.  Since this issue is fairly new it may take some time for other owners to recognize this problem and start complaining to Toyota.   Remember there is strength in numbers, if enough people bring this to Toyota's attention, maybe they'll do something about it.",1 out of 5 stars

I find a lot to like about this vehicle,.... the gas mileage is remarkable and I have averaged 35mpg in the month I have driven it with strict highway use being almost 40mpg!! I fine it to be a comfortable vehicle. It is rather quiet, a good ride, and the seats are good once you adjust them correctly for oneself. The engine has good power and generally is smooth. The steering, and overall handling are no less than good,... but here is where my concerns come into play. The lane control feature is much too sensitive and I found I was making constant steering corrections to counter what the computer thought. Turning it off made for much better steering. The active Cruise Control is also a problem as it overreaches and applies the brakes when there is absolutely no reason to do so. Keeping set to its lowest sensitivity setting helps,.. but it even activated itself when a passing vehicle would come a little too close!! The comments about engine noise are on the money. Engine performance is quite good,.. but the engine becomes a thrasher when pressed. A feature that I liked though is the warning lighting in the side mirrors letting one know that someone is in your blind spot and that and when backing up.

If driven any distance on a dirt road, the inside of all the door frames are caked with dust. It's as if the rubber seals are of no use at all. That includes the gas door.

"Indianna, 01/12/20222021ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","Hired the Hybrid and was looking forward to it.

Economy was 6 litres/100Km on mostly country driving.  Not good as my 2.0 litre 2005 BMW gets the same and does not need a battery that will need replacing at a sizeable cost.

Dynamics were ok for an entry level car.  The ABS did not do very well when stopping on dirt roads.  The traction control was worse.  If you accelerated too hard, the back swung out to the side.  Possibly it is an early (and cheaper) generation traction control unit.  Latest generation traction control and ABS measure wheel slip many times a second and hence the wheel does not noticeably slip as it slipping is stopped just as it starts.  The Toyota seemed to have a less sophisticated control unit as the wheels spun, stopped spinning, spun again, stopped spinning and spun again, which is why the rear end slid out sideways.  May work better on smooth bitumen?

Comfort was good in the front seats.  I can see people taking a test drive and being impressed.  The road noise while on a highway in the back was quite high as there is little sound insulation for the rear passengers  and the boot has places with no sound insulation at all.  To speak to the rear passengers needed us in the front to raise our voices so much that it was better to speak when in towns with slower road speed.

"John Patterson, 12/31/20212021ToyotaRAV4TRD Off-Road 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I have always owned and favored Toyota’s and Honda’s. Recently my family has had many issues with their newer model Honda’s and now Toyota seems to be lacking as well. At 3,423 miles my transmission went out in my new 2021 Rav 4. While stranded in dangerous Atlanta traffic I realized that I can no longer trust Toyota. They don’t make them like they used too! Being a mechanic for 25 plus years I would recommend staying with Japanese car manufacturers for daily drivers, but not Toyota or Honda. Do yourself a favor and buy a Mazda or Subaru. After my warranty covered the cost to replace my transmission I traded the Rav 4 in for a Subaru Crosstrek sport and I love it. It will live much longer and has great AWD capabilities. My brother has also had 10 plus years of hassle free satisfaction out of his Mazda’s. Maybe I will try Toyota again in the late future.",1 out of 5 stars

Driver and passenger door handles from inside are located in a place where it is hard to close especially for my wife, I have to pull it hard to get it close. Acceleration is good but not very good when you want to pass another vehicle while you are driving 55 - 65 mph even in sports mood.  
Fuel economy is not what I have expected it displays my average mpg 30-31 on console  but the actual mpg is lower around 22-26 combined. I drive it almost 40 miles a day that is 8 miles city and the rest is highway. All in all it seems a good car.",4 out of 5 stars
"steve wells, 12/22/20212021ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","We rented one of these for two weeks when a vehicle was in the shop. We got the AWD because we live in Alaska and this is an AWD SUV, right? We’ve owned Toyotas for years and figured no issues.
Wrong.
We got about 10” of snow one night and this vehicle could not get out of the driveway. It got stuck in the snow in the driveway.
Several issues:
1. AWD is decent for driving down the road in some inclement weather. it is bad when stuck. 4WD would sent power to all 4 wheels. AWD varies the power by what the computer wants to do, not where I want the power to go. This is why it’s good to avoid AWD if you are going to need power to all 4 wheels irrespective of what the computer says.
2. The ground clearance on this is horrible for a vehicle that claims to be an SUV. I can understand if this were a commuter vehicle like a Camry or Maxima or Impala. But this just does not work.
3. The vehicle has NO tow bolts. So we are trying to find a place to attach the tow rope and there is no place to attach it. We wound up using part of the upper engine frame because we had nowhere else to attach the tow rope. And even then, the vehicle could not overcome the amount of snow.,

Takeaway: if you live in Arizona or Texas or Florida where you never get snow, this would likely work. Bit of rain, even torrential rain, and AWD will do you fine for the roads. But if you live in Alaska or Montana or Idaho or Maine where you can get snow, and I mean real snow, not just a dusting here and there, do yourself a favor. Just get a real 4WD SUV with some ground clearance, tow hooks in the front and back, and some decent tires. The time will come when you will thank me.",3 out of 5 stars

"RB, 12/02/20212021ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I have had this RAV4 for a year now.  It is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  This RAV4 replaced a 2010 CRV EXL that I had for over 10 years.  It was a great, reliable vehicle, but this RAV4 way out performs the CRV.  But then this is newer technology also.  The RAV4 has more power, smoother ride with the 2.5L 4 cyl with the 8 speed auto trans (a great combination).  I get great gas mileage, between 33 and 34 mpg on the highway, and between 28 to 29 around town.  I love the AWD and the 19"" wheels.  Being this is my first new vehicle in over 10 years, I love all the new technology and safety features that my old vehicle did not have.  You can get a laundry list of all the great features it has on the Toyota site, so no need to list them all here.  I realize that many new vehicles have similar new technology and safety features, but I really like the styling of the RAV4 and Toyota's reputation of quality and reliability.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this vehicle.  Being in the Detroit area, I am criticized for not buying one the 'Big 3' vehicles, but I don't work for them, and their quality and reliability can't compare to Toyota as far as I am concerned.  I will put far less money into maintenance with the Toyota and it will last far longer.  You cannot go wrong with this vehicle.",5 out of 5 stars

This SUV is amazing and comfortable, as he is 5’11 and I am 5’9”. The 2.5L engine has a lot of pick me up when needed, which I don’t understand how some are saying this vehicle is underpowered, sure it’s no 8cylinder but it has more than sufficient power for everyday use. It’s very roomy, much more than my new 2021 NX 300 makes me like the RAV4 a little more since it’s also very reasonable in price with all the features it brings. We bought ours with just the features the XLE Premium has to offer with no extra add ons, since this is a commuter vehicle and my husband drives 92 miles a day round trip and a full tank of gas lasts a little over 4 days. That’s amazing for it being a gasoline engine and not a hybrid, which we tend to stay away from for now until that technology is a little more perfected. Overall I definitely recommend this trim level RAV4, oh and it’s assembled in Canada which I know from experience produces amazing quality Toyota models. Test drive one for yourself! We traded in our reliable 2017 Camry SE for this one and don’t regret it one bit! We are a Toyota family for life!!!! 

Update as of 10/05/2021 - We are still in love with our RAV4 and it’s been very reliable after 12,000 miles. Only been at Toyota for regular service and get its oil changed every 5k instead of the 10k for extra protection to the engine.

"4x4er, 03/07/20242022ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)",A family member of mine has had this 2022 RAV4 XLE since new ( currently has 27k miles ) and has kept up maintenance. Our local Toyota dealership has steadily declined in quality and recently we heard a loud snap when turning on the re-circulating air feature. Upon inspection it was discovered the cabin air filter box re circulation internal door had split at the hinge. The dealership did not address the issue and a second appointment was needed. The dealer tried to blame this on a few leaves. Which we reminded them were most likely caused by the defective door not closing and allowing leaves in. Something that was missed at each Toyota check. The dealer acknowledged this may have been the cause but refused to cover the repair. Quoting nearly 4k dollars to fix it. Safe to say we will never be using Johnstons Toyota ever again. This design flaw will probably become a recall with the plastic hing being so paper thin. We are severely disappointed in this build quality and will most likely be trading the car in.,1 out of 5 stars

Due to the high cost and demand of used cars and the shortage of new ones, we received almost what we had paid for the 2019 from the insurance pay out.   We were able to purchase a new 2022 RAV4 which turns out to be 100% better than the 2019. Why?…
The 2019 had the automatic engine shut off/turn on when the car stopped at an intersection.   This drove me f*&#@ing crazy.  Apparently so we could save gas.   The new 2022 does not have that ridiculous feature.   
The new 2022 (and older 2019) are both great cars.   The safety features are real, as the ratings from the NTSB or whomever have said.   Lots of airbags.   Both cars have plenty of power and get great gas mileage.   I have owned more than my fair share of new cars and trucks over the years and…This new 2022 RAV4 might be my favorite car of all time, surpassing my previous favorite,  2005 Honda CRV.

Acceleration is worse than my Camry, but this can be resolved by temporarily switching from Normal to Sport mode, e.g. for merging into a different lane in high-speed heavy traffic. 
The main problem I am having now with the car is that I have to rely on only one FOB key, which cost me time and money. The other day my wife needed my car for an appointment.

There are a few cons that really need to be fixed. I can only think that the designer must have never driven in his/her design. I am 5'4"" but that has never caused any problems with driving any other vehicles.

The side mirrors are poorly placed- to use the passenger side mirror you have to completely move your eyes away from the road. Sadly you have to do this to see who's on your side, because when you glance back to change lanes the back passenger windows so small you can't see anything without looking to your side mirror. 

The good stuff. We drove up mountains in Tennessee with no difficulty using the Sport mode. It seemed to allow the SUV to ""grip"" the road better. We used the Eco mode while driving the whole way on the freeway with pretty good gas mileage.

I have to say if it wasn't for those side mirrors and the back side windows, I might consider getting a Rav4. Until then, it won't happen.",4 out of 5 stars

Of course, Toyota has its own flaw (Like other) There are a few things I don't like about Toyota car 1. Cabin noise. 2. Interior material. Though, it's not a big of a deal. But I think they could do better. One tip to be advice that if you can find the one with VIN begin with J. You surely got a good quality one. Because that mean it was assembled in Japan. My 2021 Corolla was built in the US. I always notice weird noise in cabin here and there. Which mostly from cheap plastic materials. But my RAV4 was built in Japan. Totally different feel of the interior quality in a positive way. But overall, it's a very reliable and reasonable car. Never disappoint me in term of quality ride. My partner owns a 2021 Audi Q5 so I can compare luxury with my affordable RAV4. Yes, the Q5 overall is superb. It's opposite with the RAV4 in many aspects. But you always feel like you have to baby it. Or it will cost your arms and legs if you didn't buy Audi care that cost $3xxx+ extra from MSRP. Now, I really love my RAV4. My daily commute is just going to work and go home, grocery, gym and a trip out of town once a month. It gave a feeling of trust and could be rely on it in every situation. No matter if you went on a mild off road, a tiny back road or speed up on highway. It has decent power to pass a Semi who's annoyingly drive 60 mph in the passing lane! (Though it's not as quick as Q5) Also, Toyota safety sense works great on the RAV4 that I even feel like its work better than Audi. The seat, I do agree with some reviewer that it doesn't meet a level of ""super"" comfortably. (Especially if you are a big person) But it wasn't that bad for me (I'm 5'5, 165). I would recommend the RAV4 for anyone that want a crossover for a simple daily drive, hauling stuff sometime, few roads trip with family, great mpg, and etc. Who's not too crazy about the perfection. (If you want a perfect ride, smooth, quiet, fast but still want reliable, you might be better off with Lexus). Or if you do off road more often, the 4Runner or Wrangler could be your better choice.

"Irish RN, 07/24/20222022ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I was disappointed with the 2018 in one respect, and that was the safety feature of clear vision out passenger side window when checking oncoming traffic.  It had limited vision and was I feeling very vulnerable.  The 2022 rav 4 fixed this issue with making all of the passenger window clear glass and the visual around the side view mirror was much improved…BUT I lost several of the 2018 safety features with the front end and rear end collision warning signals. The sensors in the bumpers were not put into the newer models.  So I’m back to square one with feeling uncomfortable with pedestrian traffic and backing out of parking spaces.

This time: a 2022 Rav4 ""XLE"" Premium. Drove the car for a while and did it ever seem small, compared to the 4Runner. However, it was a pleasure to watch the speedometer rise and the fuel gauge stay in place.
The ;eatherette seats were one of the reasons for choosing the ""Premium"" option, as they appear to be very durable, and easier to maintain. A return trip with the car, of almost 300 miles, allowed us to verify the comfort factor. It also allowed the chance to find the design faults from Toyota.
... a very small glove compartment, with a ridiculous tray above it. Storage is a joke!
... the control screen reflects every fingerprint on its face. You have to really study the manual; I miss   .... tuning the radio, without having to search the controls. 
... no CD player.
... TOO MUCH MODERN TECHNOLOGY!
... feels small to drive, but comfortable, once that you figure out the power seat.
... typical Toyota quality; fit and finish.
... smooth operation; excellent fuel mileage (considering what I previously drove)

"Generic Human, 02/01/20222022ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","My Wife and I bought 2022 Sienna and RAV4 hybrids at the same time.  I'm 5'11 240 pounds, my wife is 5'1"". The Sienna is very comfortable for both of us, the RAV4 is uncomfortable for me. Both cars have a 12 inch wide center console. This severely limits the lateral space for my legs in the RAV4, but not in the Sienna. I measure the side to side space between the center console and door handle as 24 inches in the Sienna, and 21 inches in the RAV4. My leg has to be in the straight upright position while driving in the RAV4, but not the Sienna. The RAV4 is uncomfortable for me but not my petite wife.I strongly suggest trying the RAV4 on for size before you buy. I find both the passenger and driver seats to be too confining
Additionally the center consoles are much better designed on the Sienna, with 4 drink holders and two slots to hold cell phones upright, compared to 2 drink holders and no cell phone slots on the RAV4. There is a cutout below the console for placing a pocket book in the Sienna, but not the RAV4 The consoles are the same size.
The XLE Sienna comes with moonroof, fake leather seats, power passenger seat, and 17 inch wheels, The XLE premium RAV4 is similar to the XLE trim on the Sienna except it doesn't have power passenger seats, but it has 19 inch wheels.
The RAV4 hybrid drives quite nicely with brisk acceleration, excellent brakes, and doesnt have excessive road nice. It meets the EPA gas mileage numbers Apple Car play integrates nicely.

Poorly built and very loud, Malfunctions with radio and has already been replaced once. Needs to be replaced again, screen randomly shuts off while driving, steering wheel controls no longer work for radio and volume is randomly not work period. I cannot turn the radio up or down from the radio control when the screen display showing it is on. This has been nothing but an on going issue since 7K miles with my Limited. Navigation will just go black while traveling or flash rear camera while going forward on the highway. April 21st, 2024 at 23K miles vehicle had to be towed for malfunction in Parking Support Brake Malfunction, Secondary Collision Brake System Malfunction, Charging System Malfunction and said stop in a safe place while it shutdown my engine. My vehicle was giving off a mechanical fire and smelled like eggs. Had to stay overnight away from home as I was traveling. They cleared the codes and then the radio went out. My vehicle was just serviced 3 days prior with my local dealership replacing the radio and completing my service. Already told I need to replace my tires at 24K miles. For the amount of money I feel it is truly a waste and now hate everything is fully electronic. Toyota needs to scrap this version and try again.

"RH, 02/15/20242023ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I read all of the other reviews on here about road noise, and I have to be completely honest, this is one of the quietest rides I have ever driven! I had a Bronco Sport prior to this, so perhaps that one was just a tin can and the switch to the RAV4 was an impecable upgrade. Not sure, but I am on my 15th vehicle in 10 years, and I can honestly say it is very smooth (though somewhat stiff, which I like), ride. The RAV4 is roomy, has lots of storage space, and with the seats down, you have a lot of cargo room. 

I bought a slightly pre-owned 2023 RAV4 LE, so it is the base model (I believe), but it has all the bells and whistles I could need. Heated seats, wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto), blind side detectors on the mirrors, signal indicators on the rear of the side mirrors for traffic to see, it has a very powerful engine (which is bigger than my Bronco Sport, which very much surprised me). It has really good pep to get up to speed on the highway. It does feel like the SUV sits a bit low to the ground compared to what I previously had, but no complains. It also handles really well in the ice and snow - coming from Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, where our temperatures fluctuate between 0 and -45 in the winter lol. 

My only complains is that it is a flip key, and no remote start comes standard. It also is not eligible for the remote controls on the app to control the locks, windows, etc. This was a free service with remote start on the app for my Bronco Sport, so I was quite saddened to see that Toyota charges $9 a month to even get access to a status update as to if your doors are locked and the fuel level...but you cannot control the door locks from the app on the LE, just be forewarned about that. 

The ECO driving mode is quite nice, and I barely notice a difference when it is turned on. The fuel mileage is quite good, but driving in the winter when I have to warm up the car, it has guzzled a bit of gas in the last two week, so I won't comment on the exact MPG haha. 

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and have no regrets. The resale value on the RAV4's is exceptionally high, even after 5 years, and that heavily influenced my decision to purchase this over a CR-V.",5 out of 5 stars
"opinroad84, 01/29/20242023ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","First off, I do not own a '23 Rav4, but I rented one and spent 12 hours of mixed driving in it.  I went into this happy I'd get a chance to drive the Rav because it has been on my short list of vehicles I'm considering, but it isn't any longer.
First, what I liked.  The climate controls were excellent.  Simple buttons and large, rubberized knobs.  And it put out heat like a champ.  The shifting lever felt solid and was intuitive to use. Cargo space is excellent, as is fit and finish.  The LED headlights were more than bright enough and the Auto-High Beam feature worked as expected.  Highway passing was good, the turning radius was more than acceptable for a medium-sized SUV and fuel economy was better than most cars that are 10 or more years older.
What I didn't like: It's loud.  Really.  I have rented many cars, and I own a 2003 Matrix (which is really loud), but the RAV4 let in more road noise than any vehicle I've experienced aside from my own (and if you've driven a Matrix you don't expect noise insulation anyway). If you have the radio on at any real volume it will be difficult to talk with your road mates unless you raise your voice more than you'd like.  The transmission is not as refined as it should be (I've heard the Hybrid model is better) and the auto start/stop system was jarringly noticeable. The Adaptive Cruise Control is not subtle at all.  When the coast is clear it floors the accelerator and when it needs to slow it often abruptly brakes when easing off the gas would be just fine.  And the seats, after more than three hours, start to feel hard.  I also didn't like that my right leg was up always up against the console, and I'm only 5' 8"".  The audio quality of the entertainment system wasn't that great either (but perhaps that's adjustable in some buried menu?).
In short, I was disappointed, and for a vehicle that is hard to get into for under $31K, I would expect Toyota to have spread around a bit more sound insulation and used a more refined transmission.  That is why when I begin to look in a few months I'll be starting with a CR-V, Tuscon and Sportage.  And that saddens me because I love Toyota's reliability.",3 out of 5 stars

"BV, 01/04/20242023ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","- The noise in the cabin is mind-numbing. It's so loud you can't hear the turn signals sound.
- The car play sucks. It does not connect to the USB. Always error. Turns off unexpectedly. Black screen. Randomly activates the microphone function. Crazy.
- Door panels at night only illuminate the button on the pilot window. So, if you have to change the side mirrors or open the locks at night, you will do it by touching or turning on the interior light. There is no way you can see the buttons.
- The USB port is placed in a spot you can only see during the day. If you want to plug something in, you can only use the cell phone light because not even the interior lighting reaches this part of the dashboard.
- The fuel meter on the dashboard is semicircular and located on the upper right side. The steering wheel obstructs the indicator, so I have to look for it and remember to check the gas because there is no quick view of something important.
There is something called a man-machine interface, and it seems that whoever designed this model doesn't know about it.
It's a total disappointment. I made a 3-year lease with high quotas, intending to buy it. I'm counting the days until the lease expires and I change the car. It's a nightmare.",1 out of 5 stars

1.  The preset seat button, only controls the seat posiition, would have been nice to include the mirrors as well.  
2.  Heating system could use some improvement in volume of hot air pushed thru the dash.

"DCdriver, 12/05/20232023ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I recently rented one for a 1,200 mile trip.  While I have never liked the styling, I was hoping for a competent small SUV.  Instead I found almost nothing to like and lots that was actually bad.  Maybe some things would have been better in a higher end version
Worst were the seats.  While I could get the seat in a comfortable position, there was a support bar that hit my back in totally the wrong position.  After the 3rd day of driving my back was shot. There was no side bolstering but that may have been fixed in a higher trim level. My passenger did not have this problem and found the seats comfortable, so maybe it was just a bad seat.
Toyota generally has a good reputation for their finish.  The RAV4 was full of cheap plastic with lots of pieces that did not line up correctly. Most of the controls did not light up so they were hard to find at night.
The car had problems climbing hills.  It has to downshift a couple of gears and I really had to give it a lot of gas for the speed not to drop a lot.
For a ""compact suv"" you sit very high which makes it harder to get into and to load. Some people may like this.
The ride was both rough and floaty.  Needless to say there was nothing fun about driving it.
The lane assist was terrible.  It kept over correcting so it ended up bouncing from side to side in the lane.
There was a LOT of road noise.  MAYBE better tires would have helped.  But noise in general was higher than I was hoping/expecting.
I had CarPlay issues.  While the info center always saw my phone, occasionally car play would not start. The base system installed was about the worst I have seen in a car for a long time.  
Controls were pretty intuitive with large real knobs for HVAC speed and temperature.

Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I was using my iPhone connected to the Multi-media screen through CarPlay, when the iPhone maps app disappeared and I got a splash screen saying “Experience Toyota Drive Connect.”  There was no way to exit this screen apart from pulling over and restarting the car and reconnecting the iPhone.  I googled this issue and saw various possible solutions, but none worked.  I called Toyota and after multiple delays, was told that the only way to get rid of this screen is to purchase a subscription to “Go Anywhere” which includes Drive Connect and Remote Connect.  The cost is $15 per month, plus whatever tax you pay in your locale.  While Go Anywhere has some nice features, it should be an option, not a mandated purchase to utilize CarPlay.  It seems to me that this is essentially extortion, forcing owners to purchase a subscription in order to use CarPlay.  This is beneath the high standards of Toyota.

Im 510 227 lbs, wide built guy, and I sit comfortably.. no issues for me.. love having power seats again.. heated seats, heated steering wheel and the heated windshield or w/e, cant wait to try this winter if it snows in boston.. 

There is an auto shut off button and yes it’s annoying shutting off but that’s comes with the territory and almost all cars have it now.. so have to get used to it..

It’s a small suv that’s purpose to seat a family comfortably, comfortable ride, be reliable and have efficient power and gas mileage.. it’s not perfect but what car is? 

I don’t like how you have to buy a package go get a sunroof, older models in this body style were equipped differently but sh*t happens 

Overall I’m very happy and everyone who drives in it likes it and comments on the space and ride ..",4 out of 5 stars

"RobinD, 10/08/20232023ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I had this vehicle as a rental while my 2014 VW Passat was having body work done after an unfortunate incident with a basketball hoop. Thank god it was only a rental , even though this RAV4 was brand new with only 14,000 miles on it it was so LOUD in the cabin and making noises you shouldn’t be hearing in a brand new car. The interior is unimpressive and uncomfortable. I’m 5’4” and 130 lbs and even I thought the front was bordering on claustrophobic, I didn’t like how high the seat had me sitting either , even with the seat on the lowest setting. The acceleration is non existent , and again very loud. The ride in this was comparable to a soap box derby car . A stark difference from my VW that is quieter , more comfortable,smoother and quick , even at almost 10 years old . 

In conclusion, not a chance I’d buy this vehicle. Ever.",1 out of 5 stars

"Happy Seasoned Salesman , 08/27/20232023ToyotaRAV4LE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","After driving many competitive SUVs , settled on the RAV4. Solid feel of city  and highway driving, as I spend lot of work & leisure time in my vehicles. My sales work made easier with mobile showroom easy access cargo area with customers( sits on comfortable level to load, access, move items around.)Mpg is great. Thought I’d miss my Ford Edge , that I loved, but I don’t. This RAV is easy to love. Nicely conservative styled , crisp lines, yet not showboat machine ( which I didn’t want). Anticipating years of use. Wife finds it easy to climb in/out , it’s “ butt height” friendly ! 😊 And we ain’t spring chickens , folks , in our late 60s !",5 out of 5 stars

"Felipe, 08/07/20232023ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","I Honestly did not like this car at the beginning because of the price I ended up paying since it was my first time in the country dealing with a dealer (Always be prepared to negotiate and know what to negotiate with them). 

With that said, since the moment I did the test drive I really like it, good power nothing mind blowing but good enough to overtake cars in the highways with confidence. 

Interior built although feels dated as usually for Toyota ( that is why I feel that this car will be always be 4/5 starts), feels solid, simple and with good quality. 


Funny to see everyone complaining about the start/stop functionality, but there is a button Infront of your face to deactivate that. People just don't read manuals or try to understand the car functionalities. 

I just drove it 2500 miles across the US with around 1100 lbs of cargo since I was moving out of state, and it performed perfectly. Incredibly with that cargo, I had an average of 29.5 mpg/g throughout the entire trip. 

You do feel that you have a very high-quality car that will last....",4 out of 5 stars

It's a smooth ride, great steering, not too concerned about acceleration( had a turbo before this and don't miss it), it goes enough for me. I'm hoping this vehicle lasts longer than my Honda CRV did before I started having problems after only 3 years and 24k miles. I don't hear too much about recalls on Toyota vehicles like I have about Honda. I will update if I have issues in the future, but for now I would recommend the Rav 4.",5 out of 5 stars
"John, 06/24/20232023ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","Let me start by saying that at almost every time I’m parking, my RAV4 shuts on and off 4 times: 1) when I press the breaks to stop first, 2) when I reverse and press the break again to stop, 3) when I press the break to finally park the car, and 4) then when I shift from D to P (it turns on again, and you press the button to turn off the car). Ridiculously sensitive auto shut off, doesn’t even give you a second and a half of wait before shutting it off, as soon as you press it, it immediately turns off. Additionally, the breakpoint to whether you’re pressing lightly to avoid shutting off or not is very sensitive too, for you to press the breaks and not have it shut off on you, is like a 3 milimetre window, if you press just a LITTLE more outside this little window, it turns off, so it’s almost humanly impossible to manage and get used to not pressing a little bit more and making it shut off when you’re parking or maneuvering- in other words, when you stop the car and DO NOT want it to shut off on you. There is a button to turn off the “auto-shut off”, BUT, I DOT NOT want to be pressing the button to turn off the auto shut off every time I enter the car, I cannot really remember to do that at every time I start the car. So, it’s ridiculous that it’s a nice car but has a such a small but very annoying detail that makes you lose interest in the car just because of that. Believe me, your engine is not made to be shutting on and off 4 time sequentially and so frequently. It makes me feel sick to realize this is decreasing the lifespan of the car that I paid so much for. Also, to add another weird thing about those auto shut off system - once it is turn off and will turn on when you get you feet off the brakes, it’s kind of a rough start, you feel the car propelling itself forward. I’ve driven other cars (cheaper) that have a much smoother system. For some reason, when you press the button turn the car on, it’s not a rough start (no propelling feeling), but when it turned back on from the auto shut off, if you feel it propelled your body forward.",3 out of 5 stars

My biggest complaint is the level of road noise I hear while driving.  I had read other reviews from owners about this exact issue.  I should have taken it seriously.   Would I purchase this rav4 again after experiencing the noise for myself....?.... probably not.  Kinda sad, considering it's a beautiful car, but I expected much better for a ""new"" vehicle.    pretty  vs  function ?
I'm already considering what and when I will get my next vehicle because of this issue.

"Sadee Lynn, 06/01/20232023ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","Test drove on smooth Hwy only which was a mistake. On typical roads horrendous cabin noise, rattles in headliner where there feels like no insulation. Headrests rattle probably because of the 19” tires on that litl puppy. I’m not exaggerating to say it was difficult to have a conversation or hear music unless you were riding on a newly paved road. It could easily be pushed in on the sides making it seem like a “tin can”…sharp looking budget friendly (gas mileage) small crossover but noisy cabin, rough ride and seemed to be sub standard materials used EXCEPT for the Michelin 19” tires.

"Toyota no more, 04/29/20232023ToyotaRAV4Limited 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","We've been Toyota buyers for years and have always been very happy with them.  Until we bought a new 2023 RAV4 Limited.  It's pretty, and we like the driver safety features, like Blind Spot Monitoring and Lane Departure warnings, etc. But it has a rather rough ride, and the engine noise is bothersome.  But far and away the worst feature is both the Multi-Media display and the Multi-Information Display.  Both are so difficult and confusing to use, even after hours of studying the owners manuals, that we've mostly given up trying to use them.  We try to never attempt to change any settings because we can't do that without a great deal of difficulty and are many times unsuccessful to boot.  We've owned it for a few weeks now and I'd gladly undo this purchase. My love affair with Toyota is over.",3 out of 5 stars
"SUV Vehicle Tester, 03/30/20232023ToyotaRAV4XLE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","CONS: Uncomfortable seats. Unless you are small, they are VERY tight. Front passenger seat sits up to high, you will bang your head trying to get in this poor design body / head room area. Driving visibility is poor compared to other SUV's in is class size. The outside mirrors still shack when you drive down to road. Road noise is still to loud in this vehicle (NO new Improvements).  Only built for 4 Persons NOT 5 too small NOT comfortable on trips. The engine is still LOUD and is always searching for which gear to be in. Back seats are VERY tight for any desist leg room. Dealers are Always marking the vehicle up an extra few 1000's more WHY? Shop around or walk away, DO NOT PAY the extra bogus fees. Make sure you get all of the items listed due to the fact your vehicle may not come with everything due to material shortages. I have own 3-Toyota's and the quality has gone down hill. Also if you do order a Toyota, an it comes with a 2 year maintenance package; DO NOT WAIT FOR 10,000 miles for them to change your fist oil/filter change, this is bad you would be wise to change it at 2,500 to 5,000 to remove any contaminants left form the factory.  The only pro: Good gas mileage.",1 out of 5 stars
"AbsDad, 03/27/20232023ToyotaRAV4XLE 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 8A)","Since 1985 I've had the pleasure of owning 10 Toyota vehicles for myself and various other family members.  The RAV4 XLE continues in that tradition of reliable quality and solid performance that I've come to expect from my Toyota vehicles.  
Purchase is for a young couple with a baby on the way.  RAV4 is the perfect size for both drivers, has plenty of rear-seat room for baby seats and has LOC/tiedowns on all three seat points in the back.  
Power liftgate is perfect for an expectant mother.  Gas mileage is solid, 200hp 4 cylinder provides plenty of pickup.  STAR-safety features (especially the laser cruise control and blind spot indicating mirrors) will pay for themselves.
My only complaint?  Toyota seems to be purposely limiting supply, giving dealers way too much leverage on price (we probably paid $3-4k too much and still had to wait weeks) but it's not just Toyota shutting down production, we had to wait for an equivalent Honda as well, and Hyundai/Kia were out until they fixed their security issues.  
Overall, not a great experience, but a vehicle that was worth waiting for, if a bit too expensive.",4 out of 5 stars

It sounded like metal scrapping and whining. By 200 miles the brakes began to hiss. At this point I began to document via video the brake and steering issues. Dealer evaluated and  “fixed” the issue by saying they bent the backing plate on the braking system so it would no longer rub up against the rotor. Since the backing plate typically supports the entire braking system of rotors, calipers, brake pads, brake lines and attaches to the wheel hub this is more than a quality control issue in my opinion.  The hissing brakes returned after I got off a long freeway drive home from the dealership. If I could give Zero stars for the RAV4, I would.",1 out of 5 stars
