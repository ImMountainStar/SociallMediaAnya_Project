"02  6, 2024",Hate steel wheels/plastic hubcaps! But dependable,"Love everything about my rav with the exception of steel wheels, plain drab interior and no electric or heated seats! Mileage could be better as well!"
"03  7, 2021",Toyota Rav 4 was and is still my dream vehicle,Love the car. The previous owner had it brand new for 1 years and maintained the car perfectly as if it was a member of his own family. it rides very smoothly and it has enough room for our musical equipment and  our guitars.
"01  1, 2021",Love the V6,This my second V6 Rav4. Why Toyota discontinued this engine in the Rav is a mystery to me. Love the power and dependability that this car has.
"11 16, 2020",Most Reliable Car I’ve ever had,This car is great interior wise and a very smooth ride to be a part of. I don’t care for the outside but being inside makes you forget what it looks like.
"11 12, 2020",It is very comfortable car,"This car is roomy, family-style car. Good for short and long distances. Only one concern that doesn't has screen and i cannot listen music, i want.  But i got a bunch of CD's . Lol. Overall RAV4 is comfortable, great value for its money and i recommend it. PS. Upgraded to 2020 and happier with music options"
"11  8, 2020",Great all around car,"Owned car since 34k currently has 400k and still going strong, usual brakes rotors pads maitnence. Weird grinding noise sometimes at 40-70km/h speeds. Had driveshaft knuckle replaced, no fix, replaced transmission, helped no fix. Apparently it's a unknown common problem with the model. 4 wheel drive works slick and never got into trouble I couldn't get out of, have done quite a bit of off roading, ride is stiff but tolerable"
"10  7, 2020",RAV4 are the BEST!,"Since my first RAV4 back in the day, I've only ever driven a RAV4.  It's the perfect vehicle for fun, comfort, road trips, beach car, garden car, sports gear, while still being a grown up and driving it to fancy events with pride.  Super reliable - this car (nor its predecessors) have been in the shop for anything besides scheduled maintenance.  The ONLY reason I'm transitioning from this car is because I have three young men with lots of buddies and we need at long last a larger vehicle.  I have driving this car as a single, safe driver since 2012 when I purchased it practically new with very few miles on it.  I've only put 8k miles per year, total of 80.862 at current odometer reading."
"09 14, 2020",Fast and fun to drive.Lots of room.,"My V6 limited is everything I ever wanted.It is fast.Lots power to tow with. Sicks to the road.Huge compartment under the back hatch.Rear seats fold down easily for hauling things.I was going to get a 4 runner.So fare I haven't found any I can't fit inside or tow behind.I have a hitch for a basket or to tow my 6x10 trailer with 2  4x4  4 wheeler's and all my camping supplies.I can't say enough about the power and how it grips the road.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs I have lots of leg room, head room ,The seat will go back even more for someone with longer legs."
"06 24, 2020",This car is exceptional. Great value,"Handles really well in snow, great cargo space, roof rack, extra storage. We took long trips and never feared. Back seats fold nicely - you can easily move a small apartment. Beautiful ride."
"05 14, 2020",Don't discount this small dealer.... Nice cars,"I was really pleased.  Looked up many cars in the price point, most were beat to death.  Drove to Kaysville, and this small shop was great.  We were very picky, and very happy with the purchase.  We even consigned our other car to this dealer, because they were NOT SHADY, but decent people.  Due diligence for all car purchases is necessary, but they passed with flyilng colors."
"03 14, 2020",This RAV4 is very clean perfect engine cold A/c,"Toyota 4cylinders Gas saver perfect suspension .
My price is one of the best on the market.  Very well maintained clean tires. 
Can take the best offer"
"03 13, 2020",EXCELLENT VEHICLE,The Rav4 is perfect vehicle for every situation. It's the last V6 you can find in a compact SUV and definitely has more power. I compared it to the Forester XT before buying but it wasn't even close. Very comfortable and gets around in the mud and off-road great.
"02 15, 2020",Very nice vehicle!,This vehicle was purchase for my granddaughter. She in College at Purdue University. 4 cylinder engine which is awesome on gas. She loves it and all for friends enjoy it too.
"01 29, 2020",I fell in love with the car as soon as i tested it,I love it! Absolutely one of the best cars I've ever own.  I've only had it for a few days but i cam tell it will last me for years with minimal issues
"01  6, 2020",This car  was a perfect car i ever have,This is a nice car drive smooth and clean inside outside no issue and nice interior design it sunroof backup camera the car is perfect condition
"12 18, 2019",Great car!!!,Starts right up. I have not had any problems with the car. Great condition on the inside and out. Lot more room then I thought it would have. Lots of storage areas as well. Will buy from Carvana again as well.
"12 16, 2019",Love our RAV4,"Comfortable and efficient. The only thing we don't like is that the back door does not have a lock on it. Toyota has not been willing to install a lock. When the battery died in a public parking lot, a maintenance person put a charger on reversed and fried the electrical system. We could not lock the rear hatch. Other than this one design flaw, we love the RAV4."
"12  5, 2019",best reliable car i owened,"IT HAS PLENTY OF LEG ROOMS,3rd row with extra seat( it can be fold). The 2010 Toyota RAV4 ranks near the top of the compact SUV class. It offers a comfortable interior, a pleasant ride, loads of cargo space, plus good safety and reliability ratings."
"11 21, 2019",Drove nice,Overall good riding car just wasn't for me. I was looking for more features then what this vehicle had it was a basic model. Had excellent milage for the year it was.
"11  4, 2019",Same oil leak over and over,I felt Rav had a great reputation so I bought one. I had problem after problem with it and wouldn't recommend. I kept having a seal go on it and leaking oil.  The ride wasn't that good. I owned it for about 4 years.
"10 27, 2019",It’s Toyota RAV4 speak its self,If all cars could let you down touts rav4 will never . Electronically mechanical it’s amazingly made so tough to cross over 200k on mileage yet they still strong and for sure they still hold their price value price that they are an amazing cars and well made
"10 18, 2019",Very satisfied with this car and plan to keep it.,This car is perfect for my needs. I primarily use it to drive to work and visiting family. I am very satisfied with the car's performance and value.
"08 26, 2019",Made all plastic paint pulling off makes nose like,I wished I never bought it's been nothing but trouble taken in for recall something about key intion horn never worked since paint pulling of
"07 25, 2019",Meets our Needs,"We specifically wanted a RAV4 with a V6 engine, which was discontinued in 2012. The engine has a lot of punch, which gives you confidence in passing and crossing mountain passes. This car also has ample cargo space and a roof rack that we will probably use to transport kayaks. We will be keeping this car in our vacation home in Idaho. We have owned several Toyotas over the years (including 2 other RAV4's) and love that they are so reliable and durable!"
"06 25, 2019",Everything you'd expect from a Toyota,"The Rav4 is a great little suv. Runs smooth and has great power with the v6. This is our 2nd Rav4 with the v6 and the first one ran just as strong and smooth at 140,000 as it did the day we bought it. Did a great job of keeping us going last year during a snow storm of  8"" to 10"" in northern Minnesota."
"04  2, 2019",Great car!,This is the high end model and I love it. Was in good condition. Had a flat but also had a full size spare in great comfy.
"04  1, 2019",Very satisfied so far.  Only drove it for one day.,So far it is just great.  You sent this to me too early in the purchase.  I would suggest you wait at least a week before sending out reviews.
"03 27, 2019",I've owned a Rav for 5 yrs ... still in love,"I bought my Rav in 2014, it had 97,000kms at the time. It's currently got 230,000kms and still going strong af. I love the styling of the Rav... it's functional as well as being pretty modern ...for it's age. I get an everage i  the summer of 9.4 l/100km and in the winter it's about 10.3(Tires totally a factor). I drive 25 mins each way to work on a highway, averaging 110 km/h. I'm lucky that I have the 2.5L Base, AWD ...it's basic but still rocks in the snow and ice. I've outfitted it with a set of 16"" Gislaved Nord Frost for the winter and have always run Toyo 17""in the summer. I use only synthetic oil now for high mileage vehicles and have treated her to a oxygen sensor clean each summer as well. Having a little suspension issue now but given the KMs and our absolute xxxxe roads in Nova Scotia, it's to be expected. I have 2 kids and the space inside is more than ample for 2 car seats and all our gear.  Paint and interior have held up AMAZINGLY well for what we put it through .. .. I even use it to haul wood for the woodstove, both towed with a trailer and loads in the cargo area when super snowy and the wheelbarrow won't do. Having the diff lock is one of the main reasons I bought the Rav over the CRV, Forester and all other competitors. I've been in a ton of situations where it's been a blessing. Remember, 4 low or diff lock isn't meant to get you in ... it's meant to get you out! Cheers!"
"03 26, 2019",It is the most reliable car I have owned,"It has never given me any issues, all the maintenance it needed was the regular synthetic oil change (my preference of oil) and filters but that's about it, I had never had to take it to the mechanic for any issues, all i had to do was change the battery but that's about it. Very reliable, it drives smoothly and very comfortable."
"03 13, 2019",Great  SUV,"2010Toyota RAV4. 4WD 4-Speed Automatic 2.5L 4-Cylinder DOHC Dual VVT-i21/27 City/Highway MPGAwards: * 2011 KBB.com 10 Best Used Family Cars Under $15,000 * If you want a small-to-mid-size sport utility vehicle that combines car-like performance, ride, handling and fuel economy with available four-wheel drive and room for up to seven passengers, or five adults and a fair amount of cargo, the 2010 Toyota RAV4 is a good choice. Superb power yet great fuel economy from optional V4; huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height; comfortable ride; responsive handling."
"03  3, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"Purchased this car new for my wife.  Has basically been bullet proof with very little need for mechanical repairs.  It's understandable why these cars routinely exceed 200,000 miles and more in their lifetime."
"02 11, 2019",My favorite vehicle I have ever had,My favorite vehicle I have ever had. I had an after market radio installed in the vehicle when I bought it and everyone is very impressed with the car and it is a comfortable ride.
"02  9, 2019",Great price for a reliable car with upgrades.,Meets all of the expectations of a Toyota. It is perfect for my needs. Sunroof and rear camera unexpected features. Great performance and value. The Toyota dealership told me I got a great deal.
"01 26, 2019",Good buy. A limited edition with very low miles!!,Sporty & luxury. Good back end space with rubber mat a must! Leg room comfortable & room for child's car seat  Has a nice v6 vroom to it!
"01  8, 2019",Love it!,I love this vehicle.  2nd RAV4 that I’ve owned and I’m really happy with it.  Handles well in poor weather which is frequent in MN. Great size as well.
"12  9, 2018",extremely reliabal v6 2wd handles like sports car,I bought car used with 20000 miles it now has 50000. I love it I am going to keep this car as long as possible
"11 30, 2018",Will NEVER buy a toyota again,"I bought a brand new 2010 RAV4, lovingly cared for and pampered this car.  However, even with great maintenace this car turned out to be a nightmare.  This car was recalled so many times, i just stacked the notices, then when i incured obvious rear end problems like leaking seals and slipping differential,  the dealer wanted $105. to inspect the recall, nice.  Then in 2018 noticed gas mileage decreasing and a strange noise and vibration, after investigating it at 130,000. miles found out the torque converter and lockup clutch was bad.  Decided to get rid of it before it got any worse.  When looking for a different car, many dealorships without even looking or drving my car for trade in, said they wouldnt touch my car with a 10 foot pole because of known transmission problems with that brand and car.  So got lucky one day and traded it in to a busy chevy dealorship that never drove the car and only received 8100 on a chevy truck.  Needless to say, I will never own or buy a toyota again!!!!!!"
"10 28, 2018","Extremely reliable, versatile midsize SUV","Bought new. 218,000 miles so far and no service issues. Comfortable. 23mpg. Enough space to be useful or hold 5 adults.  Quick but not powerful. Nice handling for an SUV. 
One negative - the 4WD is only engaged under 25mph."
"10 23, 2018",Awesome awd suv!,I absolutely love this rav 4 for getting around in the harsh winters and it gets great gas mileage for our traveling adventures. It also has a good amount of space in the back to pack things in!
"10 23, 2018","100,000 miles of reliability","We have 100,000 miles on our 4 wheel drive V6 RAV4. I really love this car. The only problem it has/had is that we noticed a small leak under the engine two years ago. My mechanic said it was the rear main engine seal, and would cost $3000 to fix. We decided we could live with a minor weeping seal, which was his recommendation. It stopped leaking not long after. All fluid levels are normal, so I consider it a non-issue. Now to the positives: You can sleep in the back, as long as you put a small board down to cover the 3 inch gap. When loaded up with 4 people including climbing and camping gear it will go 80 miles an hour uphill all day long. We drive from Seattle to LA every xmas and that thing is a little sports car. It's fantastic in the snow...though that may be due more to the 4 studded snow tires. The seats feel great, even though we have the simple ones. Inside of the car is plastic...but so what? It works. Nothing has broken in 8 years. It has the original starter, water pump, radiator, alternator, everything.  I've had to do brakes of course. We love Toyotas. I've got a 2004 tacoma with 240k on the original engine and clutch! And we have a 1991 Corolla that has 365,000 on the original engine and transmission. It's the unkillable car. I just put on the third radiator. 4th gear on the Corolla  doesn't work anymore, but 4th is over rated. We go straight to 5th."
"09 23, 2018",Never see a Toyota on the side of the road,This was my first car that I actually purchased it was very great to me and my kids very low maintenance required on it great on gas it was very dependable when I finally traded it in it had over a hundred and fifteen thousand miles but it was still running so great and I really didn't want to trade it in because I loved it
"08 12, 2018",Most reliable car in the planet.,"Overall, I just feel in love with this car. I really like the exterior style designed and safety features as described. It's an eye-catching car on the roads. Love it!!! :)"
"08  8, 2018",I love the V6 269HP Limited,"It will run..I mean top speed 135 maybe more.
And real quick 50 to 80mph in a flash.
Ill say more after i tow my 5x8 bike trailer this weekend. IM GOING To lift mine and add skid plates from front to back .Then keep it forever."
"07 25, 2018",This v6 limited Rav 4 will run .130MPH PLUSE,"Its all about the 269hpV6 for me..This Rav is the quickest thing i ever owned.It goes ftom 50 to 80 in seconds..Goes good in snow wet grass dirt and with the right tires even mud..My stero sounds really good its the JBL..It came with a sub in the rear hatch door.
I was going to add one but decided i didn't need it.
I added a hitch and can tow 3500lbs if i want to.
I found a 2 inch coil spring lift from Deaver im going to put on.It will give me 3 1/2 more inches of space between the finder n tire so i can go up 3 or 4 sizes if i want..Pluse they will make the rear spring extra heavy duty and add 500lbs of hauling n towing capacity. 
I live in WV.Lots of hills n mountains. Completely loaded i can go as fast as i want up any hill with more then enough power to pass anything in my way..
I cant say enough good things about my rav. 
I run it really hard up n down hills n mountains loaded going to my camp in the mountains getting over 20mpg..If someone else would drive it would get 25mph or more..Im so happy i picked my Rav 4 over a jeep wrangler."
"07 21, 2018",The best small family car,My wife and I love this car. We haven't had any issue after owning in for 4 years and putting on 90K miles. The only way we ever get rid of it is if our family outgrows it
"07 20, 2018",Very smooth drive,Spacios the trunk and seats good power stroke over hills very reability comforth to the passenger and kids very stabiler automobile good suspension make sure for stop good driving over freeway in city too
"06 22, 2018",Get the RAV4,"I got a used 2010 rav4 limited with 80k miles on it for $11,700 after talking them down & its a really comfortable and smooth ride.  Its a nice looking vehicle, got a lot of compliments on it. I love the look of it. Perfect size for an SUV.  Easy to pull in & out of tight parking, great turning radius. Cant beat the 4WD either.  4WD is way better than AWD and getting harder to find.  I test drove other suv's; dodge journey & ford edge since I have an 04' Xterra that was just totaled & i wouldnt settle until i found another 4WD & the rav4 outbeat them by far. Never thought i would like another suv as much as my Xterra. It actually gets up speed pulling out & going uphills way quicker than my xterra did & that was a 6cylinder so that was a surprise. Plenty of cargo space & it has another hidden cubby for even more space in the back and the back seats recline individually for passenger comfort which is pretty cool. It also has push buttons to put the back seats down for even more cargo space. Great on gas and it gets up and goes really quick for a 4cylinder.  Really roomy inside. Glad I went with the rav4 especially after reading thru 100's of reviews & reading all about the other engine & trans issues on other suv's until my eyes burned outta my head & test driving the other junk.  My neighbor tried buying it from me the day after i brought it home b/c he liked it so much. He ended up finding the exact same one in the same color and all for his wife with 60k miles on it so now we have matching cars...smh.  get the rav4 if you're having trouble deciding."
"06  9, 2018",Reliability and Comfort,I have had the Toyota Rav4 2010 for 5 years and never experienced any issues! Bought it used with very high milage and even so only regular maintenance and care is all it needs to continue for many more years. It has come in handy to carry furniture and large amounts of boxes/merchandise. Very spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly large leg room in the back seats. No complaints!
"06  1, 2018","Fuel efficient, Reliable SUV","We've owned this vehicle about 5yrs and its been a tank during this time, pretty much just the basic maintence, add gas and go. Even though its a fwd version, feels equally competent in the snow.

Even though its the base model, and is a few years old still looks stylish for its age and rides well."
"05 30, 2018",This Vehicle is CHERRY!,"Vehicle has all 3 controls ( Steering, Gas and break )on both left and right of car. Vehicle could be used for mail deliveries or driving instructor! Or car could be converted back to regular vehicle."
"05 29, 2018",Same like hinds,Small size engine. Beautiful looking and Drive sweet.  The price was also very great and I bought it at end of the month so the deal was supper. I am saving gas now
"05 28, 2018",Great Dependable Car,"We  love our Toyota Rav 4.It is super dependable, it has tons of room, and very stylish. Would not trade it for anything. best thing of all is every SUV out there looks the same except the Rav4"
"05 14, 2018",Awesome Handling,Met and surpassed my needs. It has  all the space I need for transporting kids and all the features I wanted also.A delight to drive.
"05  4, 2018",Perfect Car,"Love this car. It has been so reliable. No major mechanical problems just routine things like oil changes, brakes, and tires. The 4WD is great in the winter months. Plenty of room for me and my two sons. I love this car."
"04 26, 2018",Love Toyota!,"Though I just bought my Toyota Rav4 had to avoid highways back to work, but the construction was crazy! My Toyota handled like a pro, the roads were torn up and in some cases only dirt with holes to avoid, Escaped a Cement Truck that didn't have a spotter, and the general drivers strattling to get around you. Handled great, can't wait to take her on a road trip with weekend!!!"
"04  9, 2018",I am very happy with my car,I have no complaints with my car. I enjoy driving it. It gives a nice ride. Solid car and comfortable. It has always been dependable. Would buy another one.
"04  4, 2018",Great winter and Beach car!,"I bought it used in 2014 with only 19K miles, Limited Edition and fell in love.   More comfortable than my 1998 Subaru Forester on the road ( was a very reliable vehicle That I sold to my mechanic with @170K once repairs got expensive).  Color is Blizzard White Pearl  which is so  safe color for night driving but a pain to 
match  if  you want to fill in chips yourself.  Gas mileage average is 21 mpg but they are more efficient now and the ugly spare tire cover is gone which has to be hand washed due to nooks and crannies.   I like the trunk door that opens sideways vs over your head.  Only issue is city parking that doesn?t always allow to open it completely.   Suspension and visibility is excellent. Has a small 2? by 2? backup camera in the rear view mirror.  Radio and speakers are great with optional subscription to Sirius and 6 CD player.  Heated leather seats are an asset in the cold winter months.   Fits a lot of beach gear and other bulky items.    Steering wheel has Bluetooth and radio controls to reduce distractions!   Very good safety ratings."
"03 31, 2018",hard on gas very noisy,Always wanted one as time went by got to hate this rav4 rough ride bangs over bumps wind noise on the highway is terrible it is just poor ride quality won't buy another
"03 12, 2018",Toyota is basically another name for reliability.,"I am generally not a person that likes to own a vehicle identical to what everyone else has. Obviously there are so many Rav4's on the road that it was excellent to be able to purchase a limited edition model that you do not see a lot of on the road. Mine was the Rav4 Sport with the AWD, V6, and Sport Appearance Package. This package had to be custom ordered from the dealer because the sport appearance did not come with the V6 AWD. I had a Subaru WRX and when I moved to the Rav4 as a more family oriented SUV, a little bigger, I was happy I did not lose power. The 270hp engine is super punchy and makes this vehicle like no other. Never had a single problem with it after 8 years of ownership. No check engine lights, no sensor failures, no nothing. Just the best in reliability I have ever owned. Interior is comfy and back seats have great adjustability and fold down flat. Interior road/wind noise is on the average for the type of vehicle. Not a luxury vehicle in road noise performance, but way quieter than a WRX for example. Another plus is that it is built well and after 8 years does not even show a single rust spot on the body unique my previous Jeep that seemed to just react with water when wet. Excellent value and no complaints what so ever!"
"02 22, 2018",Gets me from A to B,"It being a used older vehicle it's hard to say what the previous owner has done to it. Right off the bat my exhaust was blown though. Then there is the whole 4WD thing... I've never once seen the 4WD or VSC light come on when I'm sure I could have used it. (in 30cm of snow) It's always felt as though it is in Front Wheel Drive, which is fine for my gas mileage but the traction of 4WD would be nice. I've heard sooo many raving reviews of the Toyota RAV4 for it's reliability. I hope that's what the future holds for us. For now it does the trick."
"02 20, 2018",Very reliable.,"Toyota reliability.  Gets good fuel economy, in town and on the hwy, despite having 4wd and the capabilities of a light duty SUV.  Works for me."
"02 12, 2018",Love this vehicle!,"The interior is comfortable and stylish.  I love the cargo space, especially that the second row seats fold down flat - sliding larger, heavier items in is so easy.  And I also love the hidden storage.  The one thing I don't like:  the spare tire cover is very difficult to remove.  But I haven't needed to remove it except when I bought new tires, and then the service man did it for me."
"02 12, 2018",Fantastic Car for the Exploring Family,"We bought this RAV4 new 8 years ago.  It has been a fantastic family car.  We've taken on numerous cross-country trip, up mountains and through forests.  It's never let us down and has keep us comfortable and happy.  

And all that enjoyment has been hassle free mechanically.  It's been well taken care of with oil changes and repeated alignments.

The only reason we are selling this car is because our children have left the nest.  We are down-sizing to a Leaf and would love for this car to find a family to keep it going on adventures."
"01 20, 2018",nice car .,"very economic. i had other car cars all this years , but this is the best car out of 8 cars cars in the last 32 years, very economic in gas ."
"01  9, 2018",An SUV that can get me anywhere I want to go.,I needed a SUV that could get in anyplace I wanted to go and in any type of weather.  Also I wanted leather heated seats.  This is the one for me.
"12 14, 2017",i love it,"After driving the Pilot, Ridgeline, Highlander, Santa Fe, and several others, the Sorento EX V6 was by far the best value for my money. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like a Lexus and it handles almost like a sedan. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! On my first 500+ mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. If you're looking for a new crossover in this segment, put this one on your short list to test drive."
"12 13, 2017",The roomiest compact SUV,"Despite not being the most Luxurious or powerful in the class it is incredibly useful vehicle.  It's trunk is huge, the folding seats are very easy to use, the cabin feels more like a large SUV with a lot of leg room on both rows. The AWD is working well and got me out from snow where many other SUVs got stuck (I guess it depends on tires as well though). In 7 years that I had this car I had 1 minor fix- very reliable."
"11 25, 2017","Solid mid size SUV,  always holds its resale valvu","Reliable , No random maintainence issues other than basics required . Limited editions are much nicer inside out."
"11 20, 2017",love this car!,I've owned this car for the past 4 years now and it has been my absolute favorite. Very reliable and a perfect family car.
"11 13, 2017",Dependable and Good on Gas Car I own now,I enjoy the power buttons and the leg room and the heated seats. I also like how you can set the radio stations just by doing them on the steering wheel. I also like how the spare tire is not in the trunk like other cars I have owned. It is great for those family members or friends who use walkers and they fit easily in the back in the car.
"10 12, 2017",A Rave for RAV4,"The best vehicle that I've ever owned.  Well-designed, comfortable, an outstanding performer.  The RAV4 is highly recommended."
"10  3, 2017",Most reliable and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is a great ride for a small SUV. It is larger than the current batch of newer ones and has tons of storage space. Is a very attractive vehicle with all the bells and whistles for this year of vehicle. Nice sporty style with additional options like the moon roof which is very easy to use, roof rails, exterior tire (which adds more space inside), cargo net and cargo cover. Has a very large cargo space compared to other small SUV's and has been a joy to own. I wish the newer Rav 4s had as much space as this one and the same high ground clearance."
"09 13, 2017",Excellent condition!!!,"Clean car, low mileage, priced much lower than the same cars available in the market.
already inspected. new tires. really clean condition car"
"09  5, 2017",Good car for a family,Solid car for a family. Great relaibilty. Good on off road surfaces. Overall great suv for a family.
"09  5, 2017","Durability, is the best description!","is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"08 29, 2017",Super Commuter Car!,"For my commute? Perfect. For a long trip I would prefer my minivan. My only, and ONLY real complaint with this car is the ding-dang cup-holders are tucked almost under the radio. A 20oz cup has issues and most refillable water bottles do not fit. That said, I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  It's been 7 years and aside from the routine stuff (oil, brake pads, wipers, battery) I've only had to replace a water pump.  That pretty much screams quality!"
"08  6, 2017",Incredibly practical. Great for all lifestyles.,"Practical car. Reliable, lots of space, decent on gas, good for all lifestyles. Love how the trunk opens up sideways."
"07  3, 2017",I love the style,"Nice small SUV that has enough cargo space for my needs.
It's really simple interiors design.
It's smooth ride also."
"06 22, 2017",So good I am sorry to have to sell it!,"Great comfy SUV. Dependable and fun to drive. 
Selling only because we need bigger people mover. Only negative is the back Up camera in this model is not great."
"06 19, 2017",great car,has lots of room for a smaller car handlers very well we love are's  good family car  rides smooth has a great sound system too
"05 29, 2017",Love this car,Only owned it a short time (used to have subaru forester) but love the way it handles nice quiet ride plenty of room inside. Would definitely recommend to car.
"05  7, 2017",Good family car,It's a very reliable car and worth the money. I have not had any problems with it even at 7 years of owning it.
"05  4, 2017",Best Small SUV I could find,"I like it. Aside from the issues I have had that were unique to the way the previous owner/dealership took care of it and repairs that were done, it's been great. It gets good gas mileage, and has plenty of room for me, my friends, and all of my adventure gear."
"04 11, 2017",Love my RAV4!!,"Fun to drive, ease of handling and reliability.  Been a loyal Toyota owner for over 20 years.  Will probably continue to be one for the next 20!!!"
"04  9, 2017",Good car for the price,"We purchased this vehicle for a good price, good shape, interior nice and runs pretty good so far as we have only had it for about 2 weeks but so far so good."
"04  5, 2017",Great Experience,One of the best experiences I have ever had at a dealership. I am looking forward to buying my truck from this dealership in the near future.
"04  2, 2017",Great car,"Great car, lots of power for small SUV. I recommend buying the V6 since you get the same mpg as the 4 cylinder. Nothing wrong with more power"
"03  6, 2017",Good choice for a used vehicle,"I purchased '10 Rav-4 a month ago, with 66k.
I'm very pleased so far this car.  It was a good purchase price from Center Subaru.  Time will tell"
"01  8, 2017",Great for what it is.,"Basic, reliable transportation.   Just bought it ... 51,000 miles.  Will find out.  The CD player seems temperamental.  There front window is noisy with a lot of whistling.  Otherwise, the car seems find.  I have also a Honda Accord which feels more solid.  Not so 'tinny' when I shut the door.  However, the RAV4 is just as comfortable."
"02 19, 2016",I've loved this car!,"I bought my RAV4 Limited in 2013 used with about 40k miles on it and it has 80,000 now. I'm currently in the market to trade up to a newer year 6-cylinder RAV4 with less mileage. The V6 is a lot of fun and unfortunately was discontinued for 2013. My gas mileage averaged 26 mpg in the summer and around 23 in the winter.

Driving is responsive and fun. The stereo in my car was upgraded to the 9-speaker JBL system which is GREAT. The bluetooth, satellite radio and phone systems are somewhat antiquated I felt compared to what you could get in other vehicles, but easy to learn and use and the sound quality was good.

4 wheel-drive performance was excellent - it has a button on the console to send drive power to all four wheels up to 25 mph to get you out of tough spots, and there is over 8 inches of ground clearance to take you somewhat off road if you need to be! In everyday driving, it's comfortable and reliable. Winter driving without 4x4 is also excellent.

There is also downhill assist and traction control - the downhill assist slows the engine WAY down when you're in the lowest gear so that you creep down hills slower than you ever could in first gear without braking constantly.

No problems at all with this car other than the recalls that have been stacking up!"
"09 22, 2015",Love my used 2010 Toyoto Rav4~,I was driving a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and I have RA and getting in and out really hurt my back. I can just turn around and sit in the seat of my Rav! I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage although it could be worse. I've only had it for a month and have taken in on a 1000 mile vaca and loved it even more. If I don't have any trouble out of it I will keep it till it literally falls apart. I love it so much I have to give her a name cause she is going to be so much a part of our family. car seat and booster seat for grandkids fit great and I feel safe with them in this vehicle.
"04 20, 2015",2010 RAV4,"Not a ""drivers"" car much like most Toyotas; rides like a boat with little road feed-back. Good brakes but you have to look outside to tell that they are working. Seat adjustments are for smaller folks - I am 5'11"" and have the seat ratcheted all the way back and I still feel cramped a bit (my wife loves it though). Great room in back with many space arrangement options, Dealer fixed a factory defect promptly with no hassle. Ride is floaty-rough; could use quieter tires that Michelins on now though they perform very well. Disappointed with 25 MPG (I get 29-31 with my Honda Accord). Upgrade sound is excellent and fault-free."
"06 17, 2014",Happy with my Toyota...,"My salesperson Jean Eddy Mores did an excellent job. I appreciate going out on the rain to check my Toyota :) He made sure our needs were met, he was very courtious and patient. I never leased a car before. This was so easy the sales person went with us all the way. Now he is a friend. Thank you for looking a masculine car for my husband...
Thank you"
"10  7, 2013",Great Ride and Comfort,Easy to maneuver; great rear view for backing up. More room inside than many of the co.mpetitors that are larger
"09 14, 2013",Very good SUV,"Great on gas, very spacious and good for long trips!. Mine came with third row seat which is awesome. So far no a single complain."
"08  2, 2013",Satisfied owner,"I have only driven this car a 1000 miles, but it starts when I put the key in. It was a good value. See me next year for a more informed review..."
"06 29, 2013",Wrong Car,"We ended up buying a 2012. I believe it was listed on cars.com by a Caddy dealer. I know it's buyer beware, but many of the prices for the RAV were way over for the time period and year we were looking for. Also, they tried to lure you to them with untrue promises. We were lucky and car runs fine."
"05 16, 2013",Wow what a great car,"We traded in a Corolla for the 2010 RAV4 and although we have only had it for a short time, we LOVE it. My husband rarely drove the Corolla but I can see he is going to be using the RAV alot. Being retired I was looking for a vehicle that would provide great comfort and thought the looks of the RAV were great. We got the limited and are very impressed so far with all the features. I am so happy I searched and found the car I have been wanting."
"05 10, 2013",Love my Toyota!,"I got great customer service and they really worked with me on the price. I had a budget to stay within and they worked with me to make that happen. I love owning a Toyota! It is very reliable to drive and looks good, which makes me look good!"
"03 22, 2013",Happy so far,Very happy with the vehicle so far. Had it less than a month so can't really comment on reallity so just gave a 4 star based on others reviews.
"03 12, 2013",Love the v6,Fourth RAV4 and so glad that I went for the v6 version w/ this one. I would not go back to a 4 cylinder. The problem is that for 2013 that's all you can get. I'd miss the power. This car has been super reliable and fun to drive. I can get anywhere (snow and mud) and enjoy the gas mileage.
"11 26, 2012",Great Great Vehicle-TOYOTA PLEASE FIX TRANS WHINE!,"The car is very nice inside and out. Ne never had any trouble with the car. Value is great. Quality is very good except for the nagging transimission whining noise from 20-50 MPH or so that has been on all ravs for about a decade. This at times leads to transmisio n failure, and most of the time it is no problem. Now there is a TSB on it with a mount fix that leads nowhere then a trans replacement that does the trick. Good luck convincing them to do anything without a lot of pressure. Getting back to the vehicle, it really is great though besides the noise. It is soo much more than you realize at first. The inside may appear plain but it is actually just nice and simple and de cluttered. LOTS of room and handles GREAT!! Acceleration is like a rocket. There are times where it does not down shift at low speeds like 25mph and is a shocker. Dealer said it is normal due to drive patterns and fuel economy needs. Glove box has a plastic shock that pops off the stub all the time so that you just leave it. The map lites are in the same area as the dome lite in front so when you push it you forget to turn it off thinking it is the dome lite. Then there is not a battery saver that shuts this off. Base steering wheel even is soo comfortable. It has really nice tapers on the spoke coroners. Runs great on 87, great MPG and Power. Tires tend to round or wear on the sides befor e the middle, it may be the tires or the stabilzer makes the car feel so square that when you take an off ramp you go fast and puts a lot of load on the edge of the tires. Love this car. Evey through the little things, no doubt a must have car!! Love it love it love it!!!"
"10 10, 2012",Near Perfect,"I have to say, I wish this car was built in Detroit. The exterior styling is a bit wonky but, like consumer reports said, it's a near perfect SUV. I have a 2010 limited with 3.5L V6 and have put 30k miles on it. The leather seats are comfortable, there's class leading room in the rear seat for two grandparents and car seat. The cargo room is like 37 sq ft with the seats up. That's 1/3 more than the Cayenne and GLK etc. It's plenty fast with almost like 275hp and not as heavy as other SUVs. It's got a backup camera IN THE REARVIEW mirror! I've tried to replace this SUV with something else 20 times due to the RAV being ubiquitous. Nothing comes close. All competing SUVs either cost way more, get way worse mileage, have less rear seat room, less cargo room, or are less reliable or all of the above. It's the pinnacle SUV right now, especially with gas prices at $5."
"09  2, 2012",Pleasant Surprise,"I'm previously owned a Celica (168K mi.), 2 Camrys (266K mi. and 173K mi.) and was looking into a change of Toyota product. Because of its good reviews, I decided on the 2010 Rav4 Limited, V6 FULLY loaded with almost 40K miles. For the last few months this vehicle has been a pleasant surprise...comfortable ride, quick, responsive acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6, looks great and plenty of room for cargo or our Labrador. Its only been a short time, but, so far...LOVE IT!"
"08  1, 2012",Nice Car,"I bought the 2010 Rav4 Sport. Ive owned it a little over a month and have put approx 3000 miles on it. There is no spare tire on this model unlike the Base Rav4 or Limited Rav4. It has run flat tires that seem loud in the interior when driving. To combat the loud tires I turn up the stereo (cd, am, fm & sat) and the stereo sound is not real good. There is an upgrade to this stereo I would recommend if your into music, find a model with the upgraded stereo. The vehicle also has a 4 cylinder motor, not bad for running around town or to work and back. I test drove the v6 and its like a rocket, it would be nice to have the get up and go when you step on the gas. The interior is well designed with easy access to all the controls. The gas millage is excellent compared to my last vehicle and Im averaging around 24 mpg. The drivers seat is average, mine is not power or leather and that makes a big difference in comfort. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV."
"06  5, 2012",Rav4 Rocks!,"This is my SECOND Rav4. The first one only being taken away (literally) due to it having been totalled out in a wreck. It was a 2007, had 145,000 miles and we still received an EXTREMELY fair check from the insurance company. It paid for a slightly newer, fancier Rav with only 20,000 miles. The insurance adjuster was even surprised at what a ""salvaged"" Rav 4 was worth. The car literally never gave me any trouble. I changed the oil rarely on time, which I don't recommend and quite often went thousands of miles over and yet that car kept driving. We only put new tires on the vehicle 4 times, new brakes after 125,000 miles on the FACTORY brakes and changed the oil in this vehicle. We did do the recommended dealer inspections/spark plug replacement, etc. but other than that, this car ran like a well tuned engine the entire life of the car. We were even laughing that even due to the high miles, we would not need a new one for another 2 years! The interior on our original Rav was base, a bit noisier than our Camry was, but overall, acceptable road noise. The interior of the cabin of both the 2007 and our current 2010 model are designed around the driver. The only complaint we have found so far is the cupholders in the front seat are so close to the drop of the dash board that when you remove a ""Super Size"" cup from the cupholder, it knocks up against the bottom of the dash and will often knock the lid off and spill the drink or crush the cup. As a consequence, you have to tilt the cup to get it out of the cup holder to avoid knocking the lid off, which will sometimes unseat the lid anyway! The interior of this model is a higher end vehicle and rides much quieter and more comfortable which is to be expected with the number of upgrades (from a Base model to a Limited model). The leg room seems to be a problem in the backseat for our 13 year old recently as he is now 5'11"" so I don't recommend this vehicle if you are toting leggy teens more than a few hours. It is comfortable though and the rear seats recline which aids in the leg room issue. The seat also adjusts forward/backward as does the front seat by a bar underneath the seat which is helpful when carrying items behind the rear seat. The amount of carry space when the rear seat is up or down is amazing. We compared it to the Highlander and it is a great deal more. I have YET to be loaded to the max in this vehicle and we use it for our business carrying boxes either flat or packed from one point to another. There are interior ""hidden"" compartments as well underneath the rear floorboard that we have stuffed blankets and stadium seats into in the past along with ice chests, etc. It is amazing how much space this vehicle really has for such a small car. The exterior of the vehicle leaves a little lacking to be desired in style, but performs magically. Our vehicles sit outside all day and all night, not covered and after a recent SOFTBALL sized hail event, my husband's Ford F150 was dinged up pretty badly, my Rav, not a dint,nor ding ,nor chip of paint missing. When we purchased our first model, we got the 4 cylinder engine which was sufficient even driving in Dallas traffic and the gas mileage was wonderful. The 2010 Rav has the more powerful 6cylinder WITH tow package included and it only misses the gas mileage by a mile or two, a wonderful trade off when considering the amount of power we get with the 6 cyl engine. The vehicle shifts smoothly even at top speed when an extra burst is required for changing lanes in traffic and will get away from you at a red light if you are a heavy gas foot/jack rabbit start at the green!
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a vehicle for carrying items/smaller SUV. We purchased it as a low gas mileage dependable vehicle for business errands as well as errands for family and it has NEVER let us down, NEVER left us stranded AND NEVER failed to outperform any vehicle I have ever owned from luxury car to luxury LARGE SUV!"
"03 30, 2012",Very nice driver,"Lots of room for a small suv, great on gas easy to get in and out of parking lots.
Very comfortable, smooth and quiet."
"01 24, 2012",Very reliable brand,"The 2010 RAV 4 4 cylinder Automatic all wheel drive is very quiet to drive and provides great elbow and leg room for a family of 4. The 4 cylinder has great fuel economy and excellent acceleration. 2010 Rav 4 has several built in creature comforts - multiple cup holders - some adjustable to accommodate larger cup sizes. Also contains built in features to plug in iPod or other music storage devices. I decided on the 2010 Rav because my family was getting cramped in the 1999 Rav - but we really loved the reliability of the brand and vehicle. Toyota has improved styling, features and space (head room and leg room) in newer model years. I still drive my 1999 which has over 130,000 miles and still runs great. I expect the 2010 Rav to have the same reliability especially with how Toyota backs their vehicles. I have owned Corolla, Camry, and Rav, and would buy or recommend buying to anyone who asks. A bonus is many Toyota's are being produced in the US, so I am helping to support the US workforce."
"12  2, 2011",not relieable,"This car only has one hole to put a key into in the whole car..the dealer only gave us one remote control key which is very unhandy and dangerous.
We should of gotten two keys but they would NOt give us two keys..we already had the car in the shop twice since we bought it in a three weeks time.
I would not buy another RAV 4"
"10 20, 2011",LIMITED is GOOD...some tweaks would be nice.,"Purchased a late model 2010 in June 2011 (first owner was Oct 2010), w. 500 miles. This is primarily wife's commuter and our long-trip car. We have added 4500 miles on it 3 months. It is a Limited V6 auto, all leather interior, rearview camera, etc.... I think the interior leaves a little to be desired in comparison to others. I'm sure a comparable model with the same mileage and age would have been cheaper and have a better ""looking"" interior. But those brands cannot compete with the reliability or the durability of Toyota engines, exteriors and interiors. We expect to hold onto this for 10+ years so we also got the 100k bumper to bumper 8 year warranty and Platinum dealer service package. The V6 is very responsive with plenty of pickup. It is driven every day (avg 12 miles) in town/some interstate and is garage kept. The gas mileage is around 22-25m/g and up to 27m/g on interstate long (2+ hour) trips. The interior controls take a little getting used to. I prefer the mirror controls on the driver door vs. the center console. We have keyless entry/push button start which actually is safer and makes you more aware of where your keys are and what you are doing?we love this feature. But, I would have put the push button start on the left side of steering wheel instead of so close to temperature/radio controls. I've cut off the radio instead of the car more than once. Back seat riders have commented on how much leg room they have and the comfort of the seats. I would have expected rear temperature controls in a Limited. The ride is a little noisier (road contact not wind) than I would have expected for a top-of-the-line RAV4. The steering wheel feels a bit tiny but appropriate for the vehicle. It handles very well in parking lots (turn radius) and at high speeds (changing lanes). There are a lot of these on the road, because they are reliable. There are better LOOKING models from other brands, but the durability of them, IME, is 5-7 years. After that the interior, engines and exterior starts to falter. Aside from the small things mentioned above, I would not hesitate to buy another one. I think it's the perfect car for a married couple with 1 (maybe 2) small kid(s). I think if you have a teen you'll need to get a slightly larger vehicle. It's a joy to drive and Toyota's customer service is top notch."
"07  8, 2011",No-frills utilitarian dependable transport,"I was moving across the country, and the Rav4 was perfect as it had the most cargo volume in its class (36 cubic feet with the backseats up, and 70 with them down - both are tops in the compact crossover SUV segment).

Since purchasing the vehicle 10 months ago, I've now put on almost 10,000 miles on it. My FWD 4 cylinder model is EPA rated for 22/28 mpg, and in my real world experience I find it hard to achieve city driving of 22 mpg on an entire tank. Perhaps more like 18 to 20 mpg. On my cross country road trip, though, I was able to many times break 30 mpg on highway trips. In fact, my best tank clocked in at 32.5 mpg - pretty good. So maybe my experience of mileage is around 19/30. One thing to note - the on board mileage calculator is probably a bit generous. My own fill up measurements usually register around 1 or 2 miles lower.

The interior of the Rav4 is very ergonomic - everything where it should be, and nothing distracts from the road. There are lots of little storage areas for phones, maps, paperwork, coins, pens, cameras, etc. However, I felt that the back seat headrests are a little firm and flat, while the front seats are very cushioned and much more comfortable. One good thing though is that the back seats recline - which is a feature not always able to be had on some other SUVs.

The Rav4 is very agile and has a great turning radius. The acceleration is very sensitive and responsive at low speeds, which means the car is very quick coming out of a light or stop sign. At highway speeds, passing power a little less as good, though still adequate. Going up hills requires the engine to rev a bit.

Visibility is excellent for the most part. I feel the A pillars are a bit big, and I have to pay attention to check the sides at intersections as pedestrians on the crosswalk may get hidden in them.

Overall, I thought my purchase was an excellent value. I would recommend to those looking for lots of interior room on a budget, who are willing to sacrifice a luxurious pampering interior for a more utilitarian ergonomic small SUV that is very practical, quick, and fuel efficient compared to other cars that can deliver similar cargo volume."
"05 25, 2011","Good Car, But,","If you get this car make sure you get one with the upgraded stereo sound system already in the vehicle. The base stereo sucks. Also, had to have at least 3 Nav units replaced on this car. I really can not blame Toyota for this. I took the car to Car Toys and it really was not a better place to go. I finally got the stereo fixed by a dealership aftermarket stereo place and since then have been very happy with this small SUV. It gets 31MPG at 70MPH on the freeway. Thats a very impressive MPG considering that this is the 3.5 motor. The only anoying thing on this car is that the climate system automatically defaults to recercerculating air when the temp is reduced to it's lowest setting. It's irritating to constantly have to take the car off recerculate especially on a hot day when you don't want to run the AC."
"05 23, 2011",Great Overall Value,"I have owned the SUV for 6 months now from new. Only had two items needing correction a loose rearview mirrow screw. And a window rubber seal got caught when I rolled it up. They where easily fixed by the dealer The car came with no charge maintanence for 2yrs and 0% interest for 5yrs. We bought the V-6 Sport model with 4 wheel drive with run flat tires. Between the sport suspension and the run flat tires it rides a little hard at times on a bumpy road. It came with no spare on the back of SUV door but I prefer the look to the mounted tire on the back. It looks great and handles like a sports car. The power is excellant 0-60 in 6.2 seconds. It feels like a large SUV but it is only 182 inches. The second seat has a lot of leg room as big as any large SUV. The back hatch that opens from the side is great if you have a low garage door. Love the relining back seat. Great 2 glove boxes for storage. Speaking of storage. The SUV has plenty of storage areas for your phone, CD's, garage door opener, even a hidden storage in the floor of the trunk. It has a lot of new features like hill assist. limited slip differential, traction control, stability control. The dash looks a little on the cheap side but what do you expect in this price range. Excellant gas mileage and runs on regular gas. All and all it is a well rounded SUV. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Previous stationwagons where BMW and Mercedes. Except for the interior of the RAV the RAV has all the creature comforts you would find in a Stationwagon costing twice the price. I test drove the new redesigned BMW X3 for 2011 and I would stack it up to the BMW any day for 1/2 the price. I can see why MotorTrend gave Toyota ""Small SUV of the Year Award"" for 2006. I have owned Toyota's in the past and the reliabilty is excellant compared to the two German cars we owned. And the repair cost when and if it breaks down won't cost you nearly as much as a German car to repair."
"04 21, 2011",Not for snow,"This was my first leased SUV and I was so excited to finally have an SUV that had 4wd ability as I live out in the country of ND. It handled well in good weather, but there are a issues I noticed in the 7 months I have had the vehicle, especially over the winter months - the road grip is poor when the roads are wet or icy, and in snow, the tires pack so much snow into the wheelwell and caps that you have to clean them out or your AWD/4WD and braking system lights come on and your car shakes all over the place, and if you live in a place where there is lots of snow, that rear window wiper is a constant annoyance. Whenever you turn it on, and there is a lot of snowfall, it will get stuck midway by packed snow and it won't turn itself off - normally leading to a trip back to the dealer to get it fixed. Both need to be re-engineered, along with the coffee cup holders which keep coming out, and the car's seats which are not the most comfortable to sit on."
"04  3, 2011",2010 RAV4...4x4 (base),"i've owned the 2010 RAV4 (base model ) for 3 months...
(CONS) driver's seat - wish it was more comfy.., tilt & telescope steering wheel could be better,Sound system poor placement & quality fair/ average, some blind spots when backing out of parking space,paint is Average/fair. interior could be lil' better...

(PROS.) Does drive good, excels good...I'm getting about 25 MPG's,that's HYW & City (4cyl.)that i like! Handles good.does drive nice, i had no problem with snow this year, never even used the 4x4.,plenty of trunk space, rear-leg room a PLUS.

... Road trip in May to disney world, will see if it passes the long ride?"
"03 28, 2011",Great vehicle for the money.,"Owned for eight months since I leased this vehicle in July 2010. Positive: decent handling and acceleration compare to other Toyota, Honda, and Ford SUVs. Gas mileage is decent, 25MPG average for 4 cylinder 4x4, 70% city driving. Good visibility inside out. Excellent lease deal, $185 a month 15K a year. Two years free maintenance. Negative: Rear seats uncomfortable. Road noise. Poor dealership service experience. No steering wheel mounted controls unless you choose top of the line models."
"03 24, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,Excellent preformance in drive the 4 wheel drive is also good slightly poor in milage 21.5 mpg and good reliability smoot drive
"03 14, 2011",Suprising,"At first when I heard my mom wanted to buy an SUV I thought two things... boring and slow. After she did a little comparison between the RAV4, CRV, and Forester there was one clear winner. The Rav4 was much faster, more comfortable, and provided the same fuel economy as the competitors. She bought a 2010 Rav4 V6 Limited and has never looked back.So far she is extremely happy with her purchase. I must say that after driving the car myself the car is shockingly quick and nimble for an SUV, at least the V6 version is anyway. Overall it is a great car, and I would encourage anyone considering an SUV to at least test drive one."
"03 11, 2011","smooth acc., poor road grip poor coffee cup holder","the limited 2 wd is a much smoother car to drive than sports version or 4 wd. somewhat negative is its poor road grip in turning and on wet road. also, its coffee cup holders are very poorly designed."
"12 23, 2010",WELL PLEASED!!!!,"I have had this SUV for three months and am well pleased, thus far. I like the visibility you have of being higher up than in a car. Not sure but I think there is a blind spot when backing up. I have particularly noticed it when backing from from parking spaces in parking lots. Hope it is as good as my 1999 SOLARA that i just sold with 175,000 miles on it. The SOLARA was a wonderful car and was still very good when I sold it."
"12  4, 2010",Exactly what suits my needs,"This vehicle meets my needs because:
It drives and stops well in snow.
It is comfortable on a long drive.
It gets reasonable gas milage (26.5 mpg avg for 1200 miles, from Calif. to Washington state.)
The design and arrangement of the seats, controls, and storage inside is well thought out and functional.
I frequently drive on Forest Service roads and sometimes with some snow. I have really appreciated the safety features that keep the vehicle tracking straight under power and when breaking. We think it is a safe, reliable and efficient package for use around town, long trips, and traveling on the back roads in the wilderness.
I have towed my small sailboat, had my bike rack on it and hauled mountaineering gear up to the trailhead on snowy roads. All worked well."
"11  4, 2010",First SUV,"So far so good, drives well,,,has a couple blind spots that you have to get used to checking but overall an excellent car."
"10 28, 2010",My first Toyota SUV,"I am always on the go and live in the DFW area and the with the size of the gas tank, I have to fill up twice a week. The base model Rav I have only give me 300 miles w/ full gas tank. I wish it were at least 400. I got what I paid for. Good car for a family of 3, any more will be a tight squeeze. Very strong sturdy vehicle, the little engine is great. Has plenty of storage in the back!"
"10 12, 2010",Exceeded my expectations,"The RAV4 is quieter than I expected and the gas mileage is at least as good as the EPA estimate, if not a little better. I got the V6 which is very responsive. I like that you can lock in the 4 wheel drive at lower speeds. I only wish that it came with a compass since I did not get the navigation."
"10 12, 2010",Better than I expected,"It was a toss-up between the CR-V & RAV4, but after test driving and value-comparing the two vehicles, my new RAV4 Limited won hands down. Features that I love: 4-cyl provides great gas mileage but isn't puny when accelerating (CR-V doesn't have the gusto); stylish interior & exterior (mine is red with grey interior), heated seats, great cargo area (jogging stroller, pack n' play and tons of other baby gear fit with room to spare), XM Satellite, Bluetooth capability...and for all of us parents, the convertible car seat for my 16 month old daughter fits perfect (bench seat reclines to allow for a snug fit). This was a huge concern for me, and the CR-V didn't provide the same kind of fit - I would have had to place a rolled up towel or something similar underneath the car seat to get it to snap snuggly in place. The only drawback to the RAV4 is that the seats aren't conducive to long road trips - they get a little hard on the tushie after a while! I was on the fence given Toyota's reputation as of late, but I'm happy I took the chance - looking forward to driving my RAV4 for years to come."
"10  5, 2010",Love it!,"My husband and I moved to upstate NY and decided that we needed a four wheel drive car able to carry our golf clubs, fishing equipment and found antiques. Our only negative is gas milage. Our other car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla and we just gave our 2001 Hyundai Elantra to our daughter. Both of these vehicles get higher gas mileage. But in every other catagory, it is a 5+!"
"09 30, 2010",RAV4 is a solid car,"Just purchased but its first long distance drive proved it is what we wanted - comfortable, quiet, responsive and miserly on fuel."
"09 18, 2010",mary anns review of rav 4,I enjoy being higher up in the car it is the first time for us. We use to have an Avalon. I feel like I can see better. Very comfortable..............
"09 17, 2010",RAV4 2010 Sport V6 4WD,"Before I got my RAV4 in October 2009 I've test driven Acura RDX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Subaru Forester. In my opinion RAV4 V6 is just the best sport SUV for the money.

Pros: The acceleration is great. My black leather interior looks luxurious. The trunk space is big enough for my 2 mountain bikes :)

Cons: Would like to see sharper exterior design. Standard sound system is just ok. No Bluetooth connection.

Toyota Infamous Recall: I haven't had any issues with an acceleration pedal, but I had it replaced by a dealer just in case."
"09  6, 2010",Good car for the money.,"Got a great deal out of a three year lease. Car handles very well for a compact SUV, better than the 2005 Ford Escape I drove before. Ride can be harsh at times and highway wind and tire noise are noticeable. Overall fit and finish is good, material feels a bit cheap though. Honda and Mazda feels more luxurious. Gas mileage is decent for a 4x4 with four cylinder, I get around 25MPG on local roads. Overall I would recommend."
"08 22, 2010",Most noisy new car I have owned,"Bought new RAV4 LTD last week. When I went to pick up the car, it was noisy -- Sounds more like a Diesel engine"
"08 15, 2010",Great for the money,"I bought this car last November (2009) and I love it. It drives and handles really well so far. Unfortunately, it didn't really snow last winter so I was unable to try it on the snow. I have the base 4 cylinder model and was very satisfied with the standard features such as cruise control, keyless entry, Stability control. The interior is spacious both front and back, particularly the big trunk space. This car provides sufficient power and is very agile that it's so fun to drive. This car offers so much for the price. It definitely is a good investment for the money."
"07 11, 2010",RAV4 V6 4WD Limited,I got my RAV4 in October of 2009. If you live where it snows you must own this car! I live in Wisconsin and last winter we got 18 inches of snow one day - I was the only one who made it into the office that day. I don't know how I lived without the bluetooth or keyless entry before this car. I never have to take out my keys! The only gripes are the back door is sometimes awkward and heavy and the seats could be a touch more comfortable. But I would absolutely recommend this car - I love it! Toyota has made me a believer and I will probably buy Toyota from now on. The V6 is the way to go with the RAV4 - Honda is really missing out by not offering a V6 in their CRV. Also - there is LOTS of leg room in the backseat. The seats can be moved backward or forward. I LOVE THIS CAR!
"07  9, 2010",Ravtom,"A good value and trusted Toyota reliability. The purchase process was also painless, and started with cars.com."
"05  4, 2010",Bells and Whistles Gal,"I bought a NEW Toyota Rav4 2010 in March 2010. I bought it because I had driven a 1997 Rav4 for 10 years, sold it , and have been sorry ever since. I am so pleased. It is a V6 Limited with everything and I love each and every little gizmo. This car is ME. Thank you Toyota, the bells and whistles are a 10!"
"04 19, 2010",I wish you could try them out for a month,"I bought a limited which had many nice features. I was disappointed with the stereo. I am 5'8"" and it is even difficult for me to get the driver seat back far enough to be comfortable driving. It also feels like the seats angles toward the door which is uncomfortable for long periods of time since I commute. The ride is somewhat rough. Otherwise, it is quite roomy and appears to be well made except for the several new car rattles. The gas mileage could be better. It is fun to drive and looks nice. Love the heated seats and the cargo space. The back hatch would be better if it opened from the curbside and not the other which makes loading difficult if you are parked on the street."
"04 19, 2010",So far a nice car,I am pleased with the features on my RAV4 limited. It is not too big but it does have great back seat room.
"04 16, 2010",What a Car What A Deal,"Took ownership of a 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited in March and could not be happier. Go a head everyone and dish Toyota. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. The auto is great, I compaired it with a Subaru (I own now, big differance in quality) a crv (felt like a van). Has all the options plus I know it will last."
"04 15, 2010",Rav4 6cyl. LTD with Nav.,"This little SUV does the job but that is about it. Great power but the interior lacks certain details that should be expected for the top model.
The radio is horrific, not even good for a Yugo.

All over the interior you can see coast cutting efforts and yet the car is not so cheap. Leasing it is worth it. Maybe one of the best value lease out there.
For what I need it is fine, but I would have expected more."
"04  9, 2010",great combination of space and fuel economy,"I was sold on RAV4 during my test drive, when I made a almost 135 degree sharp right turn into a side road. Given its size, the handling was remarkable well. Feeling that even V4 gave me sufficient power, I saw no reason to get a V6. I have a long commute to work, 3/4 of it on the high way. I am truly amazed getting just over 30 MPG after two weeks driving. Granted, I am not a spirited driver and seems always get more than the window sticker number on MPG ( I get average 38 out of another car in the family, '10 Corolla in the last 7 month). I am nevertheless very pleased.

Its cargo space is surprisingly large and well laid out, although the interior materials somehow feels cheap with too much hard plastics - truly unfortunate drift by Toyota and now lagged behind Hyundai. The tires have a little bit too much road noise but so do the models from other brand. I initially thought the 4 speed auto made RAV4 look like a decade back comparing with its competitors in the class. But with the smooth ride and remarkable fuel economy, I no longer think it matters.

Recent safety recall no doubt made me think twice. But I have owned several Toyota, including a recalled '10 Corolla. I am not entirely sold by the headline story. All the negative publicity, however, did lead a great deal, including the 0% finance for 60 month. Dealer was also more willing to negotiate. Everything combined, Hyundai no longer has the price advantage and CRV became outright silly. So far, I have no regret with my purchase."
"04  1, 2010",Great Vehicle,"I recently purchased a brand new RAV4 because of the great deals Toyota was offering. I typically wouldnt be able to afford this vehicle but am very happy i was... I purchased the Base Model V6 with AWD and must say i couldnt be more impressed. The V6 has a ton of get up and go, and the options on the base model are hands down better than any other base model SUV. Only minor complaint would be that the seats could be more comfortable. LOVE IT SO FAR"
"03 24, 2010",I expect better from Toyota,"This is a very good car, but could have been great with a some more thoughtful user friendly design. No interior latch on the rear hatch is a bummer when sitting back there and changing into wet suit, bike pants, ski clothes etc. Also, when opening rear hatch, snow on roof falls INTO car. Similar problem on side doors. Center dash heater vents are hard to aim and you can't fully shut them off. Max roof weight of 200lbs is not enough for all my gear. Secondary glove box is hokey and poorly made. Automatic gear shifter drives me crazy. Very difficult to find gears when driving at night and clunky operation. The car is overly computerized. It's constantly beeping at me for some reason or another which is very distracting. Like what's up with the ""traction"" warning like I don't already know that I am sliding around on the snow and don't need to be distracted by warning bells and whistles. And every time I put a bag of groceries on the passenger seat, the no seat belt warning starts going off. Silly, but I guess that is modern cars."
"03 23, 2010",awesome rav4!!!,"I've been looking for a step up from my Toyota Solara for a while now. I settled on the Rav4 after test driving the Ford Edge (close second) and the Honda CR-V (disappointing). The Rav4 excells in comfort, styling, looks and fun! I had to wait to get my V6 in blue, but I love, love, love it!!!"
"03 16, 2010",Big improvement,"This is the 3rd Rav4 I have owned. It is a huge improvement over earlier years although at the time, I thought they were great. The new, bigger 4 cylinder engine handles the extra weight of the longer, wider Rav4 with ease. The extra cargo room is greatly appreciated by my dog and the ride is smooth. The traction and stability controls make winter driving a breeze."
"02 25, 2010",Still have faith in Toyota,"I purchased a 2010 Rav 4 Limited v6 in Nov. 2009. I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The Rav is small and sporty, yet gives me the room for 2 kids. Do your homework, and don't believe the media hype if you are a Toyota fan..."
"01 28, 2010",Great small SUV,"After much research looking at CRV, Subaru Outback & Forester, Chevy Equinox, etc, I settled on the RAV4.

I wanted good gas mileage, good in snow, room for a family of 5 plus the occasional 6 or 7th passenger & dependable. So far I think this fits the bill.

Mileage has been in upper 20's (~27) around town-we bought the 4 cylinder. It drives nice in our snowy NH winter w/good ground clearance/traction. We purchased the 3rd row seat & while small, fits our 2 boys (age 11 & 13), at least for short trips. It's too early to tell re:reliability but it has a good reputation & presumably this will hold up.

I wish the accelerator issue hadn't arisen. That adds new meaning to the Toyota slogan ""moving forward"". Toyota better get that cleared up or they will lose a lot of customers.

My only thought for improvement is I wish it was offered in a manual transmission &/or hybrid engine. Otherwise a great solid package."
"01 13, 2010",Great compact SUV,"This is my first SUV. I have owned this car for over two months now and I am very happy so far. I have the V6 4X4 limited model with NAV and leather seats.

Likes: Very quick and nimble with good ride quality. The back-up camera works well with the spare tire on the rear. The NAV system works well. You cannot input destinations while moving, but all Toyota's are like this. The bluetooth works well.

Dislikes: The driver seat position is OK, but the steering wheel blocks some of the warning lights. The glove box rattles a little."
"01  3, 2010",Very good value!,This is my first suv and I have only had it a month so I can't really compare it. But so far so good!
"01  1, 2010",Great Value - Fun to Drive - First Foreign Car,"Likes: Exterior sporty styling, INCLUDING the rear mounted spare with solid cover; roof cargo rack with rails; better than 26 MPG combined highway/city driving on new engine; interior room; large controls for climate system; center arm rest in back seat; airbags all around; telescoping/tilt steering wheel (a necessity for this vehicle); very responsive steering; 4-cylinder engine has enough power to merge into traffic and climb the hills; and vehicle FEELS solid and well-built when driving.

Dislikes: Seats are pretty firm and takes some getting used to after having a luxury van with leather seats; needs wind/rain deflectors on side windows, which I plan to add very soon. That's all so far.

Overall: I am very impressed with this vehicle, especially when you consider the price point, and Toyota's reputation for safety and resale value. For a Base model, FWD, 4-cylinder RAV, the new 2010 definitely delivers."
"12 19, 2009",One Great Compact Suv,"When I drove it (Base 4 cyl. 4 WD) the first time I loved how comfortably it drove. The handling is excellent...very smooth on the road. I thought the RAV4 controlled and dampened the bumps very well will little noise. Making turns was very easy. The power is more than adequate when starting from a stop position. I like the exterior for its new ruggedness and style, particularly the front grille. Although it was a base model and it had those steel wheels, the overall exterior is appealing and nice to look at. I also like the interior, though not as much as the exterior. Still, I found the HVAC controls very visible, assessible and easy to use. I think Toyota did a decent job with the type of materials on the dashboard. The seats are fairly comfortable. For what it's worth, I believe that the RAV4 does offer a variety of basic features such as air- conditioning, power doors, keyless entry, Brake assist... I bought the 2010 RAV4 last month and I've had so much driving pleasure. It's
a fun compact suv to drive."
"02  6, 2024",Hate steel wheels/plastic hubcaps! But dependable,"Love everything about my rav with the exception of steel wheels, plain drab interior and no electric or heated seats! Mileage could be better as well!"
"03  7, 2021",Toyota Rav 4 was and is still my dream vehicle,Love the car. The previous owner had it brand new for 1 years and maintained the car perfectly as if it was a member of his own family. it rides very smoothly and it has enough room for our musical equipment and  our guitars.
"01  1, 2021",Love the V6,This my second V6 Rav4. Why Toyota discontinued this engine in the Rav is a mystery to me. Love the power and dependability that this car has.
"11 16, 2020",Most Reliable Car I’ve ever had,This car is great interior wise and a very smooth ride to be a part of. I don’t care for the outside but being inside makes you forget what it looks like.
"11 12, 2020",It is very comfortable car,"This car is roomy, family-style car. Good for short and long distances. Only one concern that doesn't has screen and i cannot listen music, i want.  But i got a bunch of CD's . Lol. Overall RAV4 is comfortable, great value for its money and i recommend it. PS. Upgraded to 2020 and happier with music options"
"11  8, 2020",Great all around car,"Owned car since 34k currently has 400k and still going strong, usual brakes rotors pads maitnence. Weird grinding noise sometimes at 40-70km/h speeds. Had driveshaft knuckle replaced, no fix, replaced transmission, helped no fix. Apparently it's a unknown common problem with the model. 4 wheel drive works slick and never got into trouble I couldn't get out of, have done quite a bit of off roading, ride is stiff but tolerable"
"10  7, 2020",RAV4 are the BEST!,"Since my first RAV4 back in the day, I've only ever driven a RAV4.  It's the perfect vehicle for fun, comfort, road trips, beach car, garden car, sports gear, while still being a grown up and driving it to fancy events with pride.  Super reliable - this car (nor its predecessors) have been in the shop for anything besides scheduled maintenance.  The ONLY reason I'm transitioning from this car is because I have three young men with lots of buddies and we need at long last a larger vehicle.  I have driving this car as a single, safe driver since 2012 when I purchased it practically new with very few miles on it.  I've only put 8k miles per year, total of 80.862 at current odometer reading."
"09 14, 2020",Fast and fun to drive.Lots of room.,"My V6 limited is everything I ever wanted.It is fast.Lots power to tow with. Sicks to the road.Huge compartment under the back hatch.Rear seats fold down easily for hauling things.I was going to get a 4 runner.So fare I haven't found any I can't fit inside or tow behind.I have a hitch for a basket or to tow my 6x10 trailer with 2  4x4  4 wheeler's and all my camping supplies.I can't say enough about the power and how it grips the road.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs I have lots of leg room, head room ,The seat will go back even more for someone with longer legs."
"06 24, 2020",This car is exceptional. Great value,"Handles really well in snow, great cargo space, roof rack, extra storage. We took long trips and never feared. Back seats fold nicely - you can easily move a small apartment. Beautiful ride."
"05 14, 2020",Don't discount this small dealer.... Nice cars,"I was really pleased.  Looked up many cars in the price point, most were beat to death.  Drove to Kaysville, and this small shop was great.  We were very picky, and very happy with the purchase.  We even consigned our other car to this dealer, because they were NOT SHADY, but decent people.  Due diligence for all car purchases is necessary, but they passed with flyilng colors."
"03 14, 2020",This RAV4 is very clean perfect engine cold A/c,"Toyota 4cylinders Gas saver perfect suspension .
My price is one of the best on the market.  Very well maintained clean tires. 
Can take the best offer"
"03 13, 2020",EXCELLENT VEHICLE,The Rav4 is perfect vehicle for every situation. It's the last V6 you can find in a compact SUV and definitely has more power. I compared it to the Forester XT before buying but it wasn't even close. Very comfortable and gets around in the mud and off-road great.
"02 15, 2020",Very nice vehicle!,This vehicle was purchase for my granddaughter. She in College at Purdue University. 4 cylinder engine which is awesome on gas. She loves it and all for friends enjoy it too.
"01 29, 2020",I fell in love with the car as soon as i tested it,I love it! Absolutely one of the best cars I've ever own.  I've only had it for a few days but i cam tell it will last me for years with minimal issues
"01  6, 2020",This car  was a perfect car i ever have,This is a nice car drive smooth and clean inside outside no issue and nice interior design it sunroof backup camera the car is perfect condition
"12 18, 2019",Great car!!!,Starts right up. I have not had any problems with the car. Great condition on the inside and out. Lot more room then I thought it would have. Lots of storage areas as well. Will buy from Carvana again as well.
"12 16, 2019",Love our RAV4,"Comfortable and efficient. The only thing we don't like is that the back door does not have a lock on it. Toyota has not been willing to install a lock. When the battery died in a public parking lot, a maintenance person put a charger on reversed and fried the electrical system. We could not lock the rear hatch. Other than this one design flaw, we love the RAV4."
"12  5, 2019",best reliable car i owened,"IT HAS PLENTY OF LEG ROOMS,3rd row with extra seat( it can be fold). The 2010 Toyota RAV4 ranks near the top of the compact SUV class. It offers a comfortable interior, a pleasant ride, loads of cargo space, plus good safety and reliability ratings."
"11 21, 2019",Drove nice,Overall good riding car just wasn't for me. I was looking for more features then what this vehicle had it was a basic model. Had excellent milage for the year it was.
"11  4, 2019",Same oil leak over and over,I felt Rav had a great reputation so I bought one. I had problem after problem with it and wouldn't recommend. I kept having a seal go on it and leaking oil.  The ride wasn't that good. I owned it for about 4 years.
"10 27, 2019",It’s Toyota RAV4 speak its self,If all cars could let you down touts rav4 will never . Electronically mechanical it’s amazingly made so tough to cross over 200k on mileage yet they still strong and for sure they still hold their price value price that they are an amazing cars and well made
"10 18, 2019",Very satisfied with this car and plan to keep it.,This car is perfect for my needs. I primarily use it to drive to work and visiting family. I am very satisfied with the car's performance and value.
"08 26, 2019",Made all plastic paint pulling off makes nose like,I wished I never bought it's been nothing but trouble taken in for recall something about key intion horn never worked since paint pulling of
"07 25, 2019",Meets our Needs,"We specifically wanted a RAV4 with a V6 engine, which was discontinued in 2012. The engine has a lot of punch, which gives you confidence in passing and crossing mountain passes. This car also has ample cargo space and a roof rack that we will probably use to transport kayaks. We will be keeping this car in our vacation home in Idaho. We have owned several Toyotas over the years (including 2 other RAV4's) and love that they are so reliable and durable!"
"06 25, 2019",Everything you'd expect from a Toyota,"The Rav4 is a great little suv. Runs smooth and has great power with the v6. This is our 2nd Rav4 with the v6 and the first one ran just as strong and smooth at 140,000 as it did the day we bought it. Did a great job of keeping us going last year during a snow storm of  8"" to 10"" in northern Minnesota."
"04  2, 2019",Great car!,This is the high end model and I love it. Was in good condition. Had a flat but also had a full size spare in great comfy.
"04  1, 2019",Very satisfied so far.  Only drove it for one day.,So far it is just great.  You sent this to me too early in the purchase.  I would suggest you wait at least a week before sending out reviews.
"03 27, 2019",I've owned a Rav for 5 yrs ... still in love,"I bought my Rav in 2014, it had 97,000kms at the time. It's currently got 230,000kms and still going strong af. I love the styling of the Rav... it's functional as well as being pretty modern ...for it's age. I get an everage i  the summer of 9.4 l/100km and in the winter it's about 10.3(Tires totally a factor). I drive 25 mins each way to work on a highway, averaging 110 km/h. I'm lucky that I have the 2.5L Base, AWD ...it's basic but still rocks in the snow and ice. I've outfitted it with a set of 16"" Gislaved Nord Frost for the winter and have always run Toyo 17""in the summer. I use only synthetic oil now for high mileage vehicles and have treated her to a oxygen sensor clean each summer as well. Having a little suspension issue now but given the KMs and our absolute xxxxe roads in Nova Scotia, it's to be expected. I have 2 kids and the space inside is more than ample for 2 car seats and all our gear.  Paint and interior have held up AMAZINGLY well for what we put it through .. .. I even use it to haul wood for the woodstove, both towed with a trailer and loads in the cargo area when super snowy and the wheelbarrow won't do. Having the diff lock is one of the main reasons I bought the Rav over the CRV, Forester and all other competitors. I've been in a ton of situations where it's been a blessing. Remember, 4 low or diff lock isn't meant to get you in ... it's meant to get you out! Cheers!"
"03 26, 2019",It is the most reliable car I have owned,"It has never given me any issues, all the maintenance it needed was the regular synthetic oil change (my preference of oil) and filters but that's about it, I had never had to take it to the mechanic for any issues, all i had to do was change the battery but that's about it. Very reliable, it drives smoothly and very comfortable."

"03  3, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"Purchased this car new for my wife.  Has basically been bullet proof with very little need for mechanical repairs.  It's understandable why these cars routinely exceed 200,000 miles and more in their lifetime."
"02 11, 2019",My favorite vehicle I have ever had,My favorite vehicle I have ever had. I had an after market radio installed in the vehicle when I bought it and everyone is very impressed with the car and it is a comfortable ride.
"02  9, 2019",Great price for a reliable car with upgrades.,Meets all of the expectations of a Toyota. It is perfect for my needs. Sunroof and rear camera unexpected features. Great performance and value. The Toyota dealership told me I got a great deal.
"01 26, 2019",Good buy. A limited edition with very low miles!!,Sporty & luxury. Good back end space with rubber mat a must! Leg room comfortable & room for child's car seat  Has a nice v6 vroom to it!
"01  8, 2019",Love it!,I love this vehicle.  2nd RAV4 that I’ve owned and I’m really happy with it.  Handles well in poor weather which is frequent in MN. Great size as well.
"12  9, 2018",extremely reliabal v6 2wd handles like sports car,I bought car used with 20000 miles it now has 50000. I love it I am going to keep this car as long as possible
"11 30, 2018",Will NEVER buy a toyota again,"I bought a brand new 2010 RAV4, lovingly cared for and pampered this car.  However, even with great maintenace this car turned out to be a nightmare.  This car was recalled so many times, i just stacked the notices, then when i incured obvious rear end problems like leaking seals and slipping differential,  the dealer wanted $105. to inspect the recall, nice.  Then in 2018 noticed gas mileage decreasing and a strange noise and vibration, after investigating it at 130,000. miles found out the torque converter and lockup clutch was bad.  Decided to get rid of it before it got any worse.  When looking for a different car, many dealorships without even looking or drving my car for trade in, said they wouldnt touch my car with a 10 foot pole because of known transmission problems with that brand and car.  So got lucky one day and traded it in to a busy chevy dealorship that never drove the car and only received 8100 on a chevy truck.  Needless to say, I will never own or buy a toyota again!!!!!!"
"10 28, 2018","Extremely reliable, versatile midsize SUV","Bought new. 218,000 miles so far and no service issues. Comfortable. 23mpg. Enough space to be useful or hold 5 adults.  Quick but not powerful. Nice handling for an SUV. 
One negative - the 4WD is only engaged under 25mph."
"10 23, 2018",Awesome awd suv!,I absolutely love this rav 4 for getting around in the harsh winters and it gets great gas mileage for our traveling adventures. It also has a good amount of space in the back to pack things in!
"10 23, 2018","100,000 miles of reliability","We have 100,000 miles on our 4 wheel drive V6 RAV4. I really love this car. The only problem it has/had is that we noticed a small leak under the engine two years ago. My mechanic said it was the rear main engine seal, and would cost $3000 to fix. We decided we could live with a minor weeping seal, which was his recommendation. It stopped leaking not long after. All fluid levels are normal, so I consider it a non-issue. Now to the positives: You can sleep in the back, as long as you put a small board down to cover the 3 inch gap. When loaded up with 4 people including climbing and camping gear it will go 80 miles an hour uphill all day long. We drive from Seattle to LA every xmas and that thing is a little sports car. It's fantastic in the snow...though that may be due more to the 4 studded snow tires. The seats feel great, even though we have the simple ones. Inside of the car is plastic...but so what? It works. Nothing has broken in 8 years. It has the original starter, water pump, radiator, alternator, everything.  I've had to do brakes of course. We love Toyotas. I've got a 2004 tacoma with 240k on the original engine and clutch! And we have a 1991 Corolla that has 365,000 on the original engine and transmission. It's the unkillable car. I just put on the third radiator. 4th gear on the Corolla  doesn't work anymore, but 4th is over rated. We go straight to 5th."
"09 23, 2018",Never see a Toyota on the side of the road,This was my first car that I actually purchased it was very great to me and my kids very low maintenance required on it great on gas it was very dependable when I finally traded it in it had over a hundred and fifteen thousand miles but it was still running so great and I really didn't want to trade it in because I loved it
"08 12, 2018",Most reliable car in the planet.,"Overall, I just feel in love with this car. I really like the exterior style designed and safety features as described. It's an eye-catching car on the roads. Love it!!! :)"
"08  8, 2018",I love the V6 269HP Limited,"It will run..I mean top speed 135 maybe more.
And real quick 50 to 80mph in a flash.
Ill say more after i tow my 5x8 bike trailer this weekend. IM GOING To lift mine and add skid plates from front to back .Then keep it forever."
"07 25, 2018",This v6 limited Rav 4 will run .130MPH PLUSE,"Its all about the 269hpV6 for me..This Rav is the quickest thing i ever owned.It goes ftom 50 to 80 in seconds..Goes good in snow wet grass dirt and with the right tires even mud..My stero sounds really good its the JBL..It came with a sub in the rear hatch door.
I was going to add one but decided i didn't need it.
I added a hitch and can tow 3500lbs if i want to.
I found a 2 inch coil spring lift from Deaver im going to put on.It will give me 3 1/2 more inches of space between the finder n tire so i can go up 3 or 4 sizes if i want..Pluse they will make the rear spring extra heavy duty and add 500lbs of hauling n towing capacity. 
I live in WV.Lots of hills n mountains. Completely loaded i can go as fast as i want up any hill with more then enough power to pass anything in my way..
I cant say enough good things about my rav. 
I run it really hard up n down hills n mountains loaded going to my camp in the mountains getting over 20mpg..If someone else would drive it would get 25mph or more..Im so happy i picked my Rav 4 over a jeep wrangler."
"07 21, 2018",The best small family car,My wife and I love this car. We haven't had any issue after owning in for 4 years and putting on 90K miles. The only way we ever get rid of it is if our family outgrows it
"07 20, 2018",Very smooth drive,Spacios the trunk and seats good power stroke over hills very reability comforth to the passenger and kids very stabiler automobile good suspension make sure for stop good driving over freeway in city too
"06 22, 2018",Get the RAV4,"I got a used 2010 rav4 limited with 80k miles on it for $11,700 after talking them down & its a really comfortable and smooth ride.  Its a nice looking vehicle, got a lot of compliments on it. I love the look of it. Perfect size for an SUV.  Easy to pull in & out of tight parking, great turning radius. Cant beat the 4WD either.  4WD is way better than AWD and getting harder to find.  I test drove other suv's; dodge journey & ford edge since I have an 04' Xterra that was just totaled & i wouldnt settle until i found another 4WD & the rav4 outbeat them by far. Never thought i would like another suv as much as my Xterra. It actually gets up speed pulling out & going uphills way quicker than my xterra did & that was a 6cylinder so that was a surprise. Plenty of cargo space & it has another hidden cubby for even more space in the back and the back seats recline individually for passenger comfort which is pretty cool. It also has push buttons to put the back seats down for even more cargo space. Great on gas and it gets up and goes really quick for a 4cylinder.  Really roomy inside. Glad I went with the rav4 especially after reading thru 100's of reviews & reading all about the other engine & trans issues on other suv's until my eyes burned outta my head & test driving the other junk.  My neighbor tried buying it from me the day after i brought it home b/c he liked it so much. He ended up finding the exact same one in the same color and all for his wife with 60k miles on it so now we have matching cars...smh.  get the rav4 if you're having trouble deciding."
"06  9, 2018",Reliability and Comfort,I have had the Toyota Rav4 2010 for 5 years and never experienced any issues! Bought it used with very high milage and even so only regular maintenance and care is all it needs to continue for many more years. It has come in handy to carry furniture and large amounts of boxes/merchandise. Very spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly large leg room in the back seats. No complaints!
"06  1, 2018","Fuel efficient, Reliable SUV","We've owned this vehicle about 5yrs and its been a tank during this time, pretty much just the basic maintence, add gas and go. Even though its a fwd version, feels equally competent in the snow.

Even though its the base model, and is a few years old still looks stylish for its age and rides well."
"05 30, 2018",This Vehicle is CHERRY!,"Vehicle has all 3 controls ( Steering, Gas and break )on both left and right of car. Vehicle could be used for mail deliveries or driving instructor! Or car could be converted back to regular vehicle."
"05 29, 2018",Same like hinds,Small size engine. Beautiful looking and Drive sweet.  The price was also very great and I bought it at end of the month so the deal was supper. I am saving gas now
"05 28, 2018",Great Dependable Car,"We  love our Toyota Rav 4.It is super dependable, it has tons of room, and very stylish. Would not trade it for anything. best thing of all is every SUV out there looks the same except the Rav4"
"05 14, 2018",Awesome Handling,Met and surpassed my needs. It has  all the space I need for transporting kids and all the features I wanted also.A delight to drive.
"05  4, 2018",Perfect Car,"Love this car. It has been so reliable. No major mechanical problems just routine things like oil changes, brakes, and tires. The 4WD is great in the winter months. Plenty of room for me and my two sons. I love this car."
"04 26, 2018",Love Toyota!,"Though I just bought my Toyota Rav4 had to avoid highways back to work, but the construction was crazy! My Toyota handled like a pro, the roads were torn up and in some cases only dirt with holes to avoid, Escaped a Cement Truck that didn't have a spotter, and the general drivers strattling to get around you. Handled great, can't wait to take her on a road trip with weekend!!!"
"04  9, 2018",I am very happy with my car,I have no complaints with my car. I enjoy driving it. It gives a nice ride. Solid car and comfortable. It has always been dependable. Would buy another one.
"04  4, 2018",Great winter and Beach car!,"I bought it used in 2014 with only 19K miles, Limited Edition and fell in love.   More comfortable than my 1998 Subaru Forester on the road ( was a very reliable vehicle That I sold to my mechanic with @170K once repairs got expensive).  Color is Blizzard White Pearl  which is so  safe color for night driving but a pain to 
match  if  you want to fill in chips yourself.  Gas mileage average is 21 mpg but they are more efficient now and the ugly spare tire cover is gone which has to be hand washed due to nooks and crannies.   I like the trunk door that opens sideways vs over your head.  Only issue is city parking that doesn?t always allow to open it completely.   Suspension and visibility is excellent. Has a small 2? by 2? backup camera in the rear view mirror.  Radio and speakers are great with optional subscription to Sirius and 6 CD player.  Heated leather seats are an asset in the cold winter months.   Fits a lot of beach gear and other bulky items.    Steering wheel has Bluetooth and radio controls to reduce distractions!   Very good safety ratings."
"03 31, 2018",hard on gas very noisy,Always wanted one as time went by got to hate this rav4 rough ride bangs over bumps wind noise on the highway is terrible it is just poor ride quality won't buy another
"03 12, 2018",Toyota is basically another name for reliability.,"I am generally not a person that likes to own a vehicle identical to what everyone else has. Obviously there are so many Rav4's on the road that it was excellent to be able to purchase a limited edition model that you do not see a lot of on the road. Mine was the Rav4 Sport with the AWD, V6, and Sport Appearance Package. This package had to be custom ordered from the dealer because the sport appearance did not come with the V6 AWD. I had a Subaru WRX and when I moved to the Rav4 as a more family oriented SUV, a little bigger, I was happy I did not lose power. The 270hp engine is super punchy and makes this vehicle like no other. Never had a single problem with it after 8 years of ownership. No check engine lights, no sensor failures, no nothing. Just the best in reliability I have ever owned. Interior is comfy and back seats have great adjustability and fold down flat. Interior road/wind noise is on the average for the type of vehicle. Not a luxury vehicle in road noise performance, but way quieter than a WRX for example. Another plus is that it is built well and after 8 years does not even show a single rust spot on the body unique my previous Jeep that seemed to just react with water when wet. Excellent value and no complaints what so ever!"
"02 22, 2018",Gets me from A to B,"It being a used older vehicle it's hard to say what the previous owner has done to it. Right off the bat my exhaust was blown though. Then there is the whole 4WD thing... I've never once seen the 4WD or VSC light come on when I'm sure I could have used it. (in 30cm of snow) It's always felt as though it is in Front Wheel Drive, which is fine for my gas mileage but the traction of 4WD would be nice. I've heard sooo many raving reviews of the Toyota RAV4 for it's reliability. I hope that's what the future holds for us. For now it does the trick."
"02 20, 2018",Very reliable.,"Toyota reliability.  Gets good fuel economy, in town and on the hwy, despite having 4wd and the capabilities of a light duty SUV.  Works for me."
"02 12, 2018",Love this vehicle!,"The interior is comfortable and stylish.  I love the cargo space, especially that the second row seats fold down flat - sliding larger, heavier items in is so easy.  And I also love the hidden storage.  The one thing I don't like:  the spare tire cover is very difficult to remove.  But I haven't needed to remove it except when I bought new tires, and then the service man did it for me."
"02 12, 2018",Fantastic Car for the Exploring Family,"We bought this RAV4 new 8 years ago.  It has been a fantastic family car.  We've taken on numerous cross-country trip, up mountains and through forests.  It's never let us down and has keep us comfortable and happy.  

And all that enjoyment has been hassle free mechanically.  It's been well taken care of with oil changes and repeated alignments.

The only reason we are selling this car is because our children have left the nest.  We are down-sizing to a Leaf and would love for this car to find a family to keep it going on adventures."
"01 20, 2018",nice car .,"very economic. i had other car cars all this years , but this is the best car out of 8 cars cars in the last 32 years, very economic in gas ."
"01  9, 2018",An SUV that can get me anywhere I want to go.,I needed a SUV that could get in anyplace I wanted to go and in any type of weather.  Also I wanted leather heated seats.  This is the one for me.
"12 14, 2017",i love it,"After driving the Pilot, Ridgeline, Highlander, Santa Fe, and several others, the Sorento EX V6 was by far the best value for my money. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like a Lexus and it handles almost like a sedan. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! On my first 500+ mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. If you're looking for a new crossover in this segment, put this one on your short list to test drive."
"12 13, 2017",The roomiest compact SUV,"Despite not being the most Luxurious or powerful in the class it is incredibly useful vehicle.  It's trunk is huge, the folding seats are very easy to use, the cabin feels more like a large SUV with a lot of leg room on both rows. The AWD is working well and got me out from snow where many other SUVs got stuck (I guess it depends on tires as well though). In 7 years that I had this car I had 1 minor fix- very reliable."
"11 25, 2017","Solid mid size SUV,  always holds its resale valvu","Reliable , No random maintainence issues other than basics required . Limited editions are much nicer inside out."
"11 20, 2017",love this car!,I've owned this car for the past 4 years now and it has been my absolute favorite. Very reliable and a perfect family car.
"11 13, 2017",Dependable and Good on Gas Car I own now,I enjoy the power buttons and the leg room and the heated seats. I also like how you can set the radio stations just by doing them on the steering wheel. I also like how the spare tire is not in the trunk like other cars I have owned. It is great for those family members or friends who use walkers and they fit easily in the back in the car.
"10 12, 2017",A Rave for RAV4,"The best vehicle that I've ever owned.  Well-designed, comfortable, an outstanding performer.  The RAV4 is highly recommended."
"10  3, 2017",Most reliable and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is a great ride for a small SUV. It is larger than the current batch of newer ones and has tons of storage space. Is a very attractive vehicle with all the bells and whistles for this year of vehicle. Nice sporty style with additional options like the moon roof which is very easy to use, roof rails, exterior tire (which adds more space inside), cargo net and cargo cover. Has a very large cargo space compared to other small SUV's and has been a joy to own. I wish the newer Rav 4s had as much space as this one and the same high ground clearance."
"09 13, 2017",Excellent condition!!!,"Clean car, low mileage, priced much lower than the same cars available in the market.
already inspected. new tires. really clean condition car"
"09  5, 2017",Good car for a family,Solid car for a family. Great relaibilty. Good on off road surfaces. Overall great suv for a family.
"09  5, 2017","Durability, is the best description!","is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"08 29, 2017",Super Commuter Car!,"For my commute? Perfect. For a long trip I would prefer my minivan. My only, and ONLY real complaint with this car is the ding-dang cup-holders are tucked almost under the radio. A 20oz cup has issues and most refillable water bottles do not fit. That said, I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  It's been 7 years and aside from the routine stuff (oil, brake pads, wipers, battery) I've only had to replace a water pump.  That pretty much screams quality!"
"08  6, 2017",Incredibly practical. Great for all lifestyles.,"Practical car. Reliable, lots of space, decent on gas, good for all lifestyles. Love how the trunk opens up sideways."
"07  3, 2017",I love the style,"Nice small SUV that has enough cargo space for my needs.
It's really simple interiors design.
It's smooth ride also."
"06 22, 2017",So good I am sorry to have to sell it!,"Great comfy SUV. Dependable and fun to drive. 
Selling only because we need bigger people mover. Only negative is the back Up camera in this model is not great."
"06 19, 2017",great car,has lots of room for a smaller car handlers very well we love are's  good family car  rides smooth has a great sound system too
"05 29, 2017",Love this car,Only owned it a short time (used to have subaru forester) but love the way it handles nice quiet ride plenty of room inside. Would definitely recommend to car.
"05  7, 2017",Good family car,It's a very reliable car and worth the money. I have not had any problems with it even at 7 years of owning it.
"05  4, 2017",Best Small SUV I could find,"I like it. Aside from the issues I have had that were unique to the way the previous owner/dealership took care of it and repairs that were done, it's been great. It gets good gas mileage, and has plenty of room for me, my friends, and all of my adventure gear."
"04 11, 2017",Love my RAV4!!,"Fun to drive, ease of handling and reliability.  Been a loyal Toyota owner for over 20 years.  Will probably continue to be one for the next 20!!!"
"04  9, 2017",Good car for the price,"We purchased this vehicle for a good price, good shape, interior nice and runs pretty good so far as we have only had it for about 2 weeks but so far so good."
"04  5, 2017",Great Experience,One of the best experiences I have ever had at a dealership. I am looking forward to buying my truck from this dealership in the near future.
"04  2, 2017",Great car,"Great car, lots of power for small SUV. I recommend buying the V6 since you get the same mpg as the 4 cylinder. Nothing wrong with more power"
"03  6, 2017",Good choice for a used vehicle,"I purchased '10 Rav-4 a month ago, with 66k.
I'm very pleased so far this car.  It was a good purchase price from Center Subaru.  Time will tell"
"01  8, 2017",Great for what it is.,"Basic, reliable transportation.   Just bought it ... 51,000 miles.  Will find out.  The CD player seems temperamental.  There front window is noisy with a lot of whistling.  Otherwise, the car seems find.  I have also a Honda Accord which feels more solid.  Not so 'tinny' when I shut the door.  However, the RAV4 is just as comfortable."
"02 19, 2016",I've loved this car!,"I bought my RAV4 Limited in 2013 used with about 40k miles on it and it has 80,000 now. I'm currently in the market to trade up to a newer year 6-cylinder RAV4 with less mileage. The V6 is a lot of fun and unfortunately was discontinued for 2013. My gas mileage averaged 26 mpg in the summer and around 23 in the winter.

Driving is responsive and fun. The stereo in my car was upgraded to the 9-speaker JBL system which is GREAT. The bluetooth, satellite radio and phone systems are somewhat antiquated I felt compared to what you could get in other vehicles, but easy to learn and use and the sound quality was good.

4 wheel-drive performance was excellent - it has a button on the console to send drive power to all four wheels up to 25 mph to get you out of tough spots, and there is over 8 inches of ground clearance to take you somewhat off road if you need to be! In everyday driving, it's comfortable and reliable. Winter driving without 4x4 is also excellent.

There is also downhill assist and traction control - the downhill assist slows the engine WAY down when you're in the lowest gear so that you creep down hills slower than you ever could in first gear without braking constantly.

No problems at all with this car other than the recalls that have been stacking up!"
"09 22, 2015",Love my used 2010 Toyoto Rav4~,I was driving a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and I have RA and getting in and out really hurt my back. I can just turn around and sit in the seat of my Rav! I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage although it could be worse. I've only had it for a month and have taken in on a 1000 mile vaca and loved it even more. If I don't have any trouble out of it I will keep it till it literally falls apart. I love it so much I have to give her a name cause she is going to be so much a part of our family. car seat and booster seat for grandkids fit great and I feel safe with them in this vehicle.
"04 20, 2015",2010 RAV4,"Not a ""drivers"" car much like most Toyotas; rides like a boat with little road feed-back. Good brakes but you have to look outside to tell that they are working. Seat adjustments are for smaller folks - I am 5'11"" and have the seat ratcheted all the way back and I still feel cramped a bit (my wife loves it though). Great room in back with many space arrangement options, Dealer fixed a factory defect promptly with no hassle. Ride is floaty-rough; could use quieter tires that Michelins on now though they perform very well. Disappointed with 25 MPG (I get 29-31 with my Honda Accord). Upgrade sound is excellent and fault-free."
"06 17, 2014",Happy with my Toyota...,"My salesperson Jean Eddy Mores did an excellent job. I appreciate going out on the rain to check my Toyota :) He made sure our needs were met, he was very courtious and patient. I never leased a car before. This was so easy the sales person went with us all the way. Now he is a friend. Thank you for looking a masculine car for my husband...
Thank you"
"10  7, 2013",Great Ride and Comfort,Easy to maneuver; great rear view for backing up. More room inside than many of the co.mpetitors that are larger
"09 14, 2013",Very good SUV,"Great on gas, very spacious and good for long trips!. Mine came with third row seat which is awesome. So far no a single complain."
"08  2, 2013",Satisfied owner,"I have only driven this car a 1000 miles, but it starts when I put the key in. It was a good value. See me next year for a more informed review..."
"06 29, 2013",Wrong Car,"We ended up buying a 2012. I believe it was listed on cars.com by a Caddy dealer. I know it's buyer beware, but many of the prices for the RAV were way over for the time period and year we were looking for. Also, they tried to lure you to them with untrue promises. We were lucky and car runs fine."
"05 16, 2013",Wow what a great car,"We traded in a Corolla for the 2010 RAV4 and although we have only had it for a short time, we LOVE it. My husband rarely drove the Corolla but I can see he is going to be using the RAV alot. Being retired I was looking for a vehicle that would provide great comfort and thought the looks of the RAV were great. We got the limited and are very impressed so far with all the features. I am so happy I searched and found the car I have been wanting."
"05 10, 2013",Love my Toyota!,"I got great customer service and they really worked with me on the price. I had a budget to stay within and they worked with me to make that happen. I love owning a Toyota! It is very reliable to drive and looks good, which makes me look good!"
"03 22, 2013",Happy so far,Very happy with the vehicle so far. Had it less than a month so can't really comment on reallity so just gave a 4 star based on others reviews.
"03 12, 2013",Love the v6,Fourth RAV4 and so glad that I went for the v6 version w/ this one. I would not go back to a 4 cylinder. The problem is that for 2013 that's all you can get. I'd miss the power. This car has been super reliable and fun to drive. I can get anywhere (snow and mud) and enjoy the gas mileage.
"11 26, 2012",Great Great Vehicle-TOYOTA PLEASE FIX TRANS WHINE!,"The car is very nice inside and out. Ne never had any trouble with the car. Value is great. Quality is very good except for the nagging transimission whining noise from 20-50 MPH or so that has been on all ravs for about a decade. This at times leads to transmisio n failure, and most of the time it is no problem. Now there is a TSB on it with a mount fix that leads nowhere then a trans replacement that does the trick. Good luck convincing them to do anything without a lot of pressure. Getting back to the vehicle, it really is great though besides the noise. It is soo much more than you realize at first. The inside may appear plain but it is actually just nice and simple and de cluttered. LOTS of room and handles GREAT!! Acceleration is like a rocket. There are times where it does not down shift at low speeds like 25mph and is a shocker. Dealer said it is normal due to drive patterns and fuel economy needs. Glove box has a plastic shock that pops off the stub all the time so that you just leave it. The map lites are in the same area as the dome lite in front so when you push it you forget to turn it off thinking it is the dome lite. Then there is not a battery saver that shuts this off. Base steering wheel even is soo comfortable. It has really nice tapers on the spoke coroners. Runs great on 87, great MPG and Power. Tires tend to round or wear on the sides befor e the middle, it may be the tires or the stabilzer makes the car feel so square that when you take an off ramp you go fast and puts a lot of load on the edge of the tires. Love this car. Evey through the little things, no doubt a must have car!! Love it love it love it!!!"
"10 10, 2012",Near Perfect,"I have to say, I wish this car was built in Detroit. The exterior styling is a bit wonky but, like consumer reports said, it's a near perfect SUV. I have a 2010 limited with 3.5L V6 and have put 30k miles on it. The leather seats are comfortable, there's class leading room in the rear seat for two grandparents and car seat. The cargo room is like 37 sq ft with the seats up. That's 1/3 more than the Cayenne and GLK etc. It's plenty fast with almost like 275hp and not as heavy as other SUVs. It's got a backup camera IN THE REARVIEW mirror! I've tried to replace this SUV with something else 20 times due to the RAV being ubiquitous. Nothing comes close. All competing SUVs either cost way more, get way worse mileage, have less rear seat room, less cargo room, or are less reliable or all of the above. It's the pinnacle SUV right now, especially with gas prices at $5."
"09  2, 2012",Pleasant Surprise,"I'm previously owned a Celica (168K mi.), 2 Camrys (266K mi. and 173K mi.) and was looking into a change of Toyota product. Because of its good reviews, I decided on the 2010 Rav4 Limited, V6 FULLY loaded with almost 40K miles. For the last few months this vehicle has been a pleasant surprise...comfortable ride, quick, responsive acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6, looks great and plenty of room for cargo or our Labrador. Its only been a short time, but, so far...LOVE IT!"
"08  1, 2012",Nice Car,"I bought the 2010 Rav4 Sport. Ive owned it a little over a month and have put approx 3000 miles on it. There is no spare tire on this model unlike the Base Rav4 or Limited Rav4. It has run flat tires that seem loud in the interior when driving. To combat the loud tires I turn up the stereo (cd, am, fm & sat) and the stereo sound is not real good. There is an upgrade to this stereo I would recommend if your into music, find a model with the upgraded stereo. The vehicle also has a 4 cylinder motor, not bad for running around town or to work and back. I test drove the v6 and its like a rocket, it would be nice to have the get up and go when you step on the gas. The interior is well designed with easy access to all the controls. The gas millage is excellent compared to my last vehicle and Im averaging around 24 mpg. The drivers seat is average, mine is not power or leather and that makes a big difference in comfort. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV."
"06  5, 2012",Rav4 Rocks!,"This is my SECOND Rav4. The first one only being taken away (literally) due to it having been totalled out in a wreck. It was a 2007, had 145,000 miles and we still received an EXTREMELY fair check from the insurance company. It paid for a slightly newer, fancier Rav with only 20,000 miles. The insurance adjuster was even surprised at what a ""salvaged"" Rav 4 was worth. The car literally never gave me any trouble. I changed the oil rarely on time, which I don't recommend and quite often went thousands of miles over and yet that car kept driving. We only put new tires on the vehicle 4 times, new brakes after 125,000 miles on the FACTORY brakes and changed the oil in this vehicle. We did do the recommended dealer inspections/spark plug replacement, etc. but other than that, this car ran like a well tuned engine the entire life of the car. We were even laughing that even due to the high miles, we would not need a new one for another 2 years! The interior on our original Rav was base, a bit noisier than our Camry was, but overall, acceptable road noise. The interior of the cabin of both the 2007 and our current 2010 model are designed around the driver. The only complaint we have found so far is the cupholders in the front seat are so close to the drop of the dash board that when you remove a ""Super Size"" cup from the cupholder, it knocks up against the bottom of the dash and will often knock the lid off and spill the drink or crush the cup. As a consequence, you have to tilt the cup to get it out of the cup holder to avoid knocking the lid off, which will sometimes unseat the lid anyway! The interior of this model is a higher end vehicle and rides much quieter and more comfortable which is to be expected with the number of upgrades (from a Base model to a Limited model). The leg room seems to be a problem in the backseat for our 13 year old recently as he is now 5'11"" so I don't recommend this vehicle if you are toting leggy teens more than a few hours. It is comfortable though and the rear seats recline which aids in the leg room issue. The seat also adjusts forward/backward as does the front seat by a bar underneath the seat which is helpful when carrying items behind the rear seat. The amount of carry space when the rear seat is up or down is amazing. We compared it to the Highlander and it is a great deal more. I have YET to be loaded to the max in this vehicle and we use it for our business carrying boxes either flat or packed from one point to another. There are interior ""hidden"" compartments as well underneath the rear floorboard that we have stuffed blankets and stadium seats into in the past along with ice chests, etc. It is amazing how much space this vehicle really has for such a small car. The exterior of the vehicle leaves a little lacking to be desired in style, but performs magically. Our vehicles sit outside all day and all night, not covered and after a recent SOFTBALL sized hail event, my husband's Ford F150 was dinged up pretty badly, my Rav, not a dint,nor ding ,nor chip of paint missing. When we purchased our first model, we got the 4 cylinder engine which was sufficient even driving in Dallas traffic and the gas mileage was wonderful. The 2010 Rav has the more powerful 6cylinder WITH tow package included and it only misses the gas mileage by a mile or two, a wonderful trade off when considering the amount of power we get with the 6 cyl engine. The vehicle shifts smoothly even at top speed when an extra burst is required for changing lanes in traffic and will get away from you at a red light if you are a heavy gas foot/jack rabbit start at the green!
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a vehicle for carrying items/smaller SUV. We purchased it as a low gas mileage dependable vehicle for business errands as well as errands for family and it has NEVER let us down, NEVER left us stranded AND NEVER failed to outperform any vehicle I have ever owned from luxury car to luxury LARGE SUV!"
"03 30, 2012",Very nice driver,"Lots of room for a small suv, great on gas easy to get in and out of parking lots.
Very comfortable, smooth and quiet."
"01 24, 2012",Very reliable brand,"The 2010 RAV 4 4 cylinder Automatic all wheel drive is very quiet to drive and provides great elbow and leg room for a family of 4. The 4 cylinder has great fuel economy and excellent acceleration. 2010 Rav 4 has several built in creature comforts - multiple cup holders - some adjustable to accommodate larger cup sizes. Also contains built in features to plug in iPod or other music storage devices. I decided on the 2010 Rav because my family was getting cramped in the 1999 Rav - but we really loved the reliability of the brand and vehicle. Toyota has improved styling, features and space (head room and leg room) in newer model years. I still drive my 1999 which has over 130,000 miles and still runs great. I expect the 2010 Rav to have the same reliability especially with how Toyota backs their vehicles. I have owned Corolla, Camry, and Rav, and would buy or recommend buying to anyone who asks. A bonus is many Toyota's are being produced in the US, so I am helping to support the US workforce."
"12  2, 2011",not relieable,"This car only has one hole to put a key into in the whole car..the dealer only gave us one remote control key which is very unhandy and dangerous.
We should of gotten two keys but they would NOt give us two keys..we already had the car in the shop twice since we bought it in a three weeks time.
I would not buy another RAV 4"
"10 20, 2011",LIMITED is GOOD...some tweaks would be nice.,"Purchased a late model 2010 in June 2011 (first owner was Oct 2010), w. 500 miles. This is primarily wife's commuter and our long-trip car. We have added 4500 miles on it 3 months. It is a Limited V6 auto, all leather interior, rearview camera, etc.... I think the interior leaves a little to be desired in comparison to others. I'm sure a comparable model with the same mileage and age would have been cheaper and have a better ""looking"" interior. But those brands cannot compete with the reliability or the durability of Toyota engines, exteriors and interiors. We expect to hold onto this for 10+ years so we also got the 100k bumper to bumper 8 year warranty and Platinum dealer service package. The V6 is very responsive with plenty of pickup. It is driven every day (avg 12 miles) in town/some interstate and is garage kept. The gas mileage is around 22-25m/g and up to 27m/g on interstate long (2+ hour) trips. The interior controls take a little getting used to. I prefer the mirror controls on the driver door vs. the center console. We have keyless entry/push button start which actually is safer and makes you more aware of where your keys are and what you are doing?we love this feature. But, I would have put the push button start on the left side of steering wheel instead of so close to temperature/radio controls. I've cut off the radio instead of the car more than once. Back seat riders have commented on how much leg room they have and the comfort of the seats. I would have expected rear temperature controls in a Limited. The ride is a little noisier (road contact not wind) than I would have expected for a top-of-the-line RAV4. The steering wheel feels a bit tiny but appropriate for the vehicle. It handles very well in parking lots (turn radius) and at high speeds (changing lanes). There are a lot of these on the road, because they are reliable. There are better LOOKING models from other brands, but the durability of them, IME, is 5-7 years. After that the interior, engines and exterior starts to falter. Aside from the small things mentioned above, I would not hesitate to buy another one. I think it's the perfect car for a married couple with 1 (maybe 2) small kid(s). I think if you have a teen you'll need to get a slightly larger vehicle. It's a joy to drive and Toyota's customer service is top notch."
"07  8, 2011",No-frills utilitarian dependable transport,"I was moving across the country, and the Rav4 was perfect as it had the most cargo volume in its class (36 cubic feet with the backseats up, and 70 with them down - both are tops in the compact crossover SUV segment).

Since purchasing the vehicle 10 months ago, I've now put on almost 10,000 miles on it. My FWD 4 cylinder model is EPA rated for 22/28 mpg, and in my real world experience I find it hard to achieve city driving of 22 mpg on an entire tank. Perhaps more like 18 to 20 mpg. On my cross country road trip, though, I was able to many times break 30 mpg on highway trips. In fact, my best tank clocked in at 32.5 mpg - pretty good. So maybe my experience of mileage is around 19/30. One thing to note - the on board mileage calculator is probably a bit generous. My own fill up measurements usually register around 1 or 2 miles lower.

The interior of the Rav4 is very ergonomic - everything where it should be, and nothing distracts from the road. There are lots of little storage areas for phones, maps, paperwork, coins, pens, cameras, etc. However, I felt that the back seat headrests are a little firm and flat, while the front seats are very cushioned and much more comfortable. One good thing though is that the back seats recline - which is a feature not always able to be had on some other SUVs.

The Rav4 is very agile and has a great turning radius. The acceleration is very sensitive and responsive at low speeds, which means the car is very quick coming out of a light or stop sign. At highway speeds, passing power a little less as good, though still adequate. Going up hills requires the engine to rev a bit.

Visibility is excellent for the most part. I feel the A pillars are a bit big, and I have to pay attention to check the sides at intersections as pedestrians on the crosswalk may get hidden in them.

Overall, I thought my purchase was an excellent value. I would recommend to those looking for lots of interior room on a budget, who are willing to sacrifice a luxurious pampering interior for a more utilitarian ergonomic small SUV that is very practical, quick, and fuel efficient compared to other cars that can deliver similar cargo volume."
"05 25, 2011","Good Car, But,","If you get this car make sure you get one with the upgraded stereo sound system already in the vehicle. The base stereo sucks. Also, had to have at least 3 Nav units replaced on this car. I really can not blame Toyota for this. I took the car to Car Toys and it really was not a better place to go. I finally got the stereo fixed by a dealership aftermarket stereo place and since then have been very happy with this small SUV. It gets 31MPG at 70MPH on the freeway. Thats a very impressive MPG considering that this is the 3.5 motor. The only anoying thing on this car is that the climate system automatically defaults to recercerculating air when the temp is reduced to it's lowest setting. It's irritating to constantly have to take the car off recerculate especially on a hot day when you don't want to run the AC."
"05 23, 2011",Great Overall Value,"I have owned the SUV for 6 months now from new. Only had two items needing correction a loose rearview mirrow screw. And a window rubber seal got caught when I rolled it up. They where easily fixed by the dealer The car came with no charge maintanence for 2yrs and 0% interest for 5yrs. We bought the V-6 Sport model with 4 wheel drive with run flat tires. Between the sport suspension and the run flat tires it rides a little hard at times on a bumpy road. It came with no spare on the back of SUV door but I prefer the look to the mounted tire on the back. It looks great and handles like a sports car. The power is excellant 0-60 in 6.2 seconds. It feels like a large SUV but it is only 182 inches. The second seat has a lot of leg room as big as any large SUV. The back hatch that opens from the side is great if you have a low garage door. Love the relining back seat. Great 2 glove boxes for storage. Speaking of storage. The SUV has plenty of storage areas for your phone, CD's, garage door opener, even a hidden storage in the floor of the trunk. It has a lot of new features like hill assist. limited slip differential, traction control, stability control. The dash looks a little on the cheap side but what do you expect in this price range. Excellant gas mileage and runs on regular gas. All and all it is a well rounded SUV. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Previous stationwagons where BMW and Mercedes. Except for the interior of the RAV the RAV has all the creature comforts you would find in a Stationwagon costing twice the price. I test drove the new redesigned BMW X3 for 2011 and I would stack it up to the BMW any day for 1/2 the price. I can see why MotorTrend gave Toyota ""Small SUV of the Year Award"" for 2006. I have owned Toyota's in the past and the reliabilty is excellant compared to the two German cars we owned. And the repair cost when and if it breaks down won't cost you nearly as much as a German car to repair."
"04 21, 2011",Not for snow,"This was my first leased SUV and I was so excited to finally have an SUV that had 4wd ability as I live out in the country of ND. It handled well in good weather, but there are a issues I noticed in the 7 months I have had the vehicle, especially over the winter months - the road grip is poor when the roads are wet or icy, and in snow, the tires pack so much snow into the wheelwell and caps that you have to clean them out or your AWD/4WD and braking system lights come on and your car shakes all over the place, and if you live in a place where there is lots of snow, that rear window wiper is a constant annoyance. Whenever you turn it on, and there is a lot of snowfall, it will get stuck midway by packed snow and it won't turn itself off - normally leading to a trip back to the dealer to get it fixed. Both need to be re-engineered, along with the coffee cup holders which keep coming out, and the car's seats which are not the most comfortable to sit on."
"04  3, 2011",2010 RAV4...4x4 (base),"i've owned the 2010 RAV4 (base model ) for 3 months...
(CONS) driver's seat - wish it was more comfy.., tilt & telescope steering wheel could be better,Sound system poor placement & quality fair/ average, some blind spots when backing out of parking space,paint is Average/fair. interior could be lil' better...

(PROS.) Does drive good, excels good...I'm getting about 25 MPG's,that's HYW & City (4cyl.)that i like! Handles good.does drive nice, i had no problem with snow this year, never even used the 4x4.,plenty of trunk space, rear-leg room a PLUS.

... Road trip in May to disney world, will see if it passes the long ride?"
"03 28, 2011",Great vehicle for the money.,"Owned for eight months since I leased this vehicle in July 2010. Positive: decent handling and acceleration compare to other Toyota, Honda, and Ford SUVs. Gas mileage is decent, 25MPG average for 4 cylinder 4x4, 70% city driving. Good visibility inside out. Excellent lease deal, $185 a month 15K a year. Two years free maintenance. Negative: Rear seats uncomfortable. Road noise. Poor dealership service experience. No steering wheel mounted controls unless you choose top of the line models."
"03 24, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,Excellent preformance in drive the 4 wheel drive is also good slightly poor in milage 21.5 mpg and good reliability smoot drive
"03 14, 2011",Suprising,"At first when I heard my mom wanted to buy an SUV I thought two things... boring and slow. After she did a little comparison between the RAV4, CRV, and Forester there was one clear winner. The Rav4 was much faster, more comfortable, and provided the same fuel economy as the competitors. She bought a 2010 Rav4 V6 Limited and has never looked back.So far she is extremely happy with her purchase. I must say that after driving the car myself the car is shockingly quick and nimble for an SUV, at least the V6 version is anyway. Overall it is a great car, and I would encourage anyone considering an SUV to at least test drive one."
"03 11, 2011","smooth acc., poor road grip poor coffee cup holder","the limited 2 wd is a much smoother car to drive than sports version or 4 wd. somewhat negative is its poor road grip in turning and on wet road. also, its coffee cup holders are very poorly designed."
"12 23, 2010",WELL PLEASED!!!!,"I have had this SUV for three months and am well pleased, thus far. I like the visibility you have of being higher up than in a car. Not sure but I think there is a blind spot when backing up. I have particularly noticed it when backing from from parking spaces in parking lots. Hope it is as good as my 1999 SOLARA that i just sold with 175,000 miles on it. The SOLARA was a wonderful car and was still very good when I sold it."
"12  4, 2010",Exactly what suits my needs,"This vehicle meets my needs because:
It drives and stops well in snow.
It is comfortable on a long drive.
It gets reasonable gas milage (26.5 mpg avg for 1200 miles, from Calif. to Washington state.)
The design and arrangement of the seats, controls, and storage inside is well thought out and functional.
I frequently drive on Forest Service roads and sometimes with some snow. I have really appreciated the safety features that keep the vehicle tracking straight under power and when breaking. We think it is a safe, reliable and efficient package for use around town, long trips, and traveling on the back roads in the wilderness.
I have towed my small sailboat, had my bike rack on it and hauled mountaineering gear up to the trailhead on snowy roads. All worked well."
"11  4, 2010",First SUV,"So far so good, drives well,,,has a couple blind spots that you have to get used to checking but overall an excellent car."
"10 28, 2010",My first Toyota SUV,"I am always on the go and live in the DFW area and the with the size of the gas tank, I have to fill up twice a week. The base model Rav I have only give me 300 miles w/ full gas tank. I wish it were at least 400. I got what I paid for. Good car for a family of 3, any more will be a tight squeeze. Very strong sturdy vehicle, the little engine is great. Has plenty of storage in the back!"
"10 12, 2010",Exceeded my expectations,"The RAV4 is quieter than I expected and the gas mileage is at least as good as the EPA estimate, if not a little better. I got the V6 which is very responsive. I like that you can lock in the 4 wheel drive at lower speeds. I only wish that it came with a compass since I did not get the navigation."
"10 12, 2010",Better than I expected,"It was a toss-up between the CR-V & RAV4, but after test driving and value-comparing the two vehicles, my new RAV4 Limited won hands down. Features that I love: 4-cyl provides great gas mileage but isn't puny when accelerating (CR-V doesn't have the gusto); stylish interior & exterior (mine is red with grey interior), heated seats, great cargo area (jogging stroller, pack n' play and tons of other baby gear fit with room to spare), XM Satellite, Bluetooth capability...and for all of us parents, the convertible car seat for my 16 month old daughter fits perfect (bench seat reclines to allow for a snug fit). This was a huge concern for me, and the CR-V didn't provide the same kind of fit - I would have had to place a rolled up towel or something similar underneath the car seat to get it to snap snuggly in place. The only drawback to the RAV4 is that the seats aren't conducive to long road trips - they get a little hard on the tushie after a while! I was on the fence given Toyota's reputation as of late, but I'm happy I took the chance - looking forward to driving my RAV4 for years to come."
"10  5, 2010",Love it!,"My husband and I moved to upstate NY and decided that we needed a four wheel drive car able to carry our golf clubs, fishing equipment and found antiques. Our only negative is gas milage. Our other car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla and we just gave our 2001 Hyundai Elantra to our daughter. Both of these vehicles get higher gas mileage. But in every other catagory, it is a 5+!"
"09 30, 2010",RAV4 is a solid car,"Just purchased but its first long distance drive proved it is what we wanted - comfortable, quiet, responsive and miserly on fuel."
"09 18, 2010",mary anns review of rav 4,I enjoy being higher up in the car it is the first time for us. We use to have an Avalon. I feel like I can see better. Very comfortable..............
"09 17, 2010",RAV4 2010 Sport V6 4WD,"Before I got my RAV4 in October 2009 I've test driven Acura RDX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Subaru Forester. In my opinion RAV4 V6 is just the best sport SUV for the money.

Pros: The acceleration is great. My black leather interior looks luxurious. The trunk space is big enough for my 2 mountain bikes :)

Cons: Would like to see sharper exterior design. Standard sound system is just ok. No Bluetooth connection.

Toyota Infamous Recall: I haven't had any issues with an acceleration pedal, but I had it replaced by a dealer just in case."
"09  6, 2010",Good car for the money.,"Got a great deal out of a three year lease. Car handles very well for a compact SUV, better than the 2005 Ford Escape I drove before. Ride can be harsh at times and highway wind and tire noise are noticeable. Overall fit and finish is good, material feels a bit cheap though. Honda and Mazda feels more luxurious. Gas mileage is decent for a 4x4 with four cylinder, I get around 25MPG on local roads. Overall I would recommend."
"08 22, 2010",Most noisy new car I have owned,"Bought new RAV4 LTD last week. When I went to pick up the car, it was noisy -- Sounds more like a Diesel engine"
"08 15, 2010",Great for the money,"I bought this car last November (2009) and I love it. It drives and handles really well so far. Unfortunately, it didn't really snow last winter so I was unable to try it on the snow. I have the base 4 cylinder model and was very satisfied with the standard features such as cruise control, keyless entry, Stability control. The interior is spacious both front and back, particularly the big trunk space. This car provides sufficient power and is very agile that it's so fun to drive. This car offers so much for the price. It definitely is a good investment for the money."
"07 11, 2010",RAV4 V6 4WD Limited,I got my RAV4 in October of 2009. If you live where it snows you must own this car! I live in Wisconsin and last winter we got 18 inches of snow one day - I was the only one who made it into the office that day. I don't know how I lived without the bluetooth or keyless entry before this car. I never have to take out my keys! The only gripes are the back door is sometimes awkward and heavy and the seats could be a touch more comfortable. But I would absolutely recommend this car - I love it! Toyota has made me a believer and I will probably buy Toyota from now on. The V6 is the way to go with the RAV4 - Honda is really missing out by not offering a V6 in their CRV. Also - there is LOTS of leg room in the backseat. The seats can be moved backward or forward. I LOVE THIS CAR!
"07  9, 2010",Ravtom,"A good value and trusted Toyota reliability. The purchase process was also painless, and started with cars.com."
"05  4, 2010",Bells and Whistles Gal,"I bought a NEW Toyota Rav4 2010 in March 2010. I bought it because I had driven a 1997 Rav4 for 10 years, sold it , and have been sorry ever since. I am so pleased. It is a V6 Limited with everything and I love each and every little gizmo. This car is ME. Thank you Toyota, the bells and whistles are a 10!"
"04 19, 2010",I wish you could try them out for a month,"I bought a limited which had many nice features. I was disappointed with the stereo. I am 5'8"" and it is even difficult for me to get the driver seat back far enough to be comfortable driving. It also feels like the seats angles toward the door which is uncomfortable for long periods of time since I commute. The ride is somewhat rough. Otherwise, it is quite roomy and appears to be well made except for the several new car rattles. The gas mileage could be better. It is fun to drive and looks nice. Love the heated seats and the cargo space. The back hatch would be better if it opened from the curbside and not the other which makes loading difficult if you are parked on the street."
"04 19, 2010",So far a nice car,I am pleased with the features on my RAV4 limited. It is not too big but it does have great back seat room.
"04 16, 2010",What a Car What A Deal,"Took ownership of a 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited in March and could not be happier. Go a head everyone and dish Toyota. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. The auto is great, I compaired it with a Subaru (I own now, big differance in quality) a crv (felt like a van). Has all the options plus I know it will last."
"04 15, 2010",Rav4 6cyl. LTD with Nav.,"This little SUV does the job but that is about it. Great power but the interior lacks certain details that should be expected for the top model.
The radio is horrific, not even good for a Yugo.

All over the interior you can see coast cutting efforts and yet the car is not so cheap. Leasing it is worth it. Maybe one of the best value lease out there.
For what I need it is fine, but I would have expected more."
"04  9, 2010",great combination of space and fuel economy,"I was sold on RAV4 during my test drive, when I made a almost 135 degree sharp right turn into a side road. Given its size, the handling was remarkable well. Feeling that even V4 gave me sufficient power, I saw no reason to get a V6. I have a long commute to work, 3/4 of it on the high way. I am truly amazed getting just over 30 MPG after two weeks driving. Granted, I am not a spirited driver and seems always get more than the window sticker number on MPG ( I get average 38 out of another car in the family, '10 Corolla in the last 7 month). I am nevertheless very pleased.

Its cargo space is surprisingly large and well laid out, although the interior materials somehow feels cheap with too much hard plastics - truly unfortunate drift by Toyota and now lagged behind Hyundai. The tires have a little bit too much road noise but so do the models from other brand. I initially thought the 4 speed auto made RAV4 look like a decade back comparing with its competitors in the class. But with the smooth ride and remarkable fuel economy, I no longer think it matters.

Recent safety recall no doubt made me think twice. But I have owned several Toyota, including a recalled '10 Corolla. I am not entirely sold by the headline story. All the negative publicity, however, did lead a great deal, including the 0% finance for 60 month. Dealer was also more willing to negotiate. Everything combined, Hyundai no longer has the price advantage and CRV became outright silly. So far, I have no regret with my purchase."
"04  1, 2010",Great Vehicle,"I recently purchased a brand new RAV4 because of the great deals Toyota was offering. I typically wouldnt be able to afford this vehicle but am very happy i was... I purchased the Base Model V6 with AWD and must say i couldnt be more impressed. The V6 has a ton of get up and go, and the options on the base model are hands down better than any other base model SUV. Only minor complaint would be that the seats could be more comfortable. LOVE IT SO FAR"
"03 24, 2010",I expect better from Toyota,"This is a very good car, but could have been great with a some more thoughtful user friendly design. No interior latch on the rear hatch is a bummer when sitting back there and changing into wet suit, bike pants, ski clothes etc. Also, when opening rear hatch, snow on roof falls INTO car. Similar problem on side doors. Center dash heater vents are hard to aim and you can't fully shut them off. Max roof weight of 200lbs is not enough for all my gear. Secondary glove box is hokey and poorly made. Automatic gear shifter drives me crazy. Very difficult to find gears when driving at night and clunky operation. The car is overly computerized. It's constantly beeping at me for some reason or another which is very distracting. Like what's up with the ""traction"" warning like I don't already know that I am sliding around on the snow and don't need to be distracted by warning bells and whistles. And every time I put a bag of groceries on the passenger seat, the no seat belt warning starts going off. Silly, but I guess that is modern cars."
"03 23, 2010",awesome rav4!!!,"I've been looking for a step up from my Toyota Solara for a while now. I settled on the Rav4 after test driving the Ford Edge (close second) and the Honda CR-V (disappointing). The Rav4 excells in comfort, styling, looks and fun! I had to wait to get my V6 in blue, but I love, love, love it!!!"
"03 16, 2010",Big improvement,"This is the 3rd Rav4 I have owned. It is a huge improvement over earlier years although at the time, I thought they were great. The new, bigger 4 cylinder engine handles the extra weight of the longer, wider Rav4 with ease. The extra cargo room is greatly appreciated by my dog and the ride is smooth. The traction and stability controls make winter driving a breeze."
"02 25, 2010",Still have faith in Toyota,"I purchased a 2010 Rav 4 Limited v6 in Nov. 2009. I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The Rav is small and sporty, yet gives me the room for 2 kids. Do your homework, and don't believe the media hype if you are a Toyota fan..."
"01 28, 2010",Great small SUV,"After much research looking at CRV, Subaru Outback & Forester, Chevy Equinox, etc, I settled on the RAV4.

I wanted good gas mileage, good in snow, room for a family of 5 plus the occasional 6 or 7th passenger & dependable. So far I think this fits the bill.

Mileage has been in upper 20's (~27) around town-we bought the 4 cylinder. It drives nice in our snowy NH winter w/good ground clearance/traction. We purchased the 3rd row seat & while small, fits our 2 boys (age 11 & 13), at least for short trips. It's too early to tell re:reliability but it has a good reputation & presumably this will hold up.

I wish the accelerator issue hadn't arisen. That adds new meaning to the Toyota slogan ""moving forward"". Toyota better get that cleared up or they will lose a lot of customers.

My only thought for improvement is I wish it was offered in a manual transmission &/or hybrid engine. Otherwise a great solid package."
"01 13, 2010",Great compact SUV,"This is my first SUV. I have owned this car for over two months now and I am very happy so far. I have the V6 4X4 limited model with NAV and leather seats.

Likes: Very quick and nimble with good ride quality. The back-up camera works well with the spare tire on the rear. The NAV system works well. You cannot input destinations while moving, but all Toyota's are like this. The bluetooth works well.

Dislikes: The driver seat position is OK, but the steering wheel blocks some of the warning lights. The glove box rattles a little."
"01  3, 2010",Very good value!,This is my first suv and I have only had it a month so I can't really compare it. But so far so good!
"01  1, 2010",Great Value - Fun to Drive - First Foreign Car,"Likes: Exterior sporty styling, INCLUDING the rear mounted spare with solid cover; roof cargo rack with rails; better than 26 MPG combined highway/city driving on new engine; interior room; large controls for climate system; center arm rest in back seat; airbags all around; telescoping/tilt steering wheel (a necessity for this vehicle); very responsive steering; 4-cylinder engine has enough power to merge into traffic and climb the hills; and vehicle FEELS solid and well-built when driving.

Dislikes: Seats are pretty firm and takes some getting used to after having a luxury van with leather seats; needs wind/rain deflectors on side windows, which I plan to add very soon. That's all so far.

Overall: I am very impressed with this vehicle, especially when you consider the price point, and Toyota's reputation for safety and resale value. For a Base model, FWD, 4-cylinder RAV, the new 2010 definitely delivers."
"12 19, 2009",One Great Compact Suv,"When I drove it (Base 4 cyl. 4 WD) the first time I loved how comfortably it drove. The handling is excellent...very smooth on the road. I thought the RAV4 controlled and dampened the bumps very well will little noise. Making turns was very easy. The power is more than adequate when starting from a stop position. I like the exterior for its new ruggedness and style, particularly the front grille. Although it was a base model and it had those steel wheels, the overall exterior is appealing and nice to look at. I also like the interior, though not as much as the exterior. Still, I found the HVAC controls very visible, assessible and easy to use. I think Toyota did a decent job with the type of materials on the dashboard. The seats are fairly comfortable. For what it's worth, I believe that the RAV4 does offer a variety of basic features such as air- conditioning, power doors, keyless entry, Brake assist... I bought the 2010 RAV4 last month and I've had so much driving pleasure. It's
a fun compact suv to drive."
"02  6, 2024",Hate steel wheels/plastic hubcaps! But dependable,"Love everything about my rav with the exception of steel wheels, plain drab interior and no electric or heated seats! Mileage could be better as well!"
"03  7, 2021",Toyota Rav 4 was and is still my dream vehicle,Love the car. The previous owner had it brand new for 1 years and maintained the car perfectly as if it was a member of his own family. it rides very smoothly and it has enough room for our musical equipment and  our guitars.
"01  1, 2021",Love the V6,This my second V6 Rav4. Why Toyota discontinued this engine in the Rav is a mystery to me. Love the power and dependability that this car has.
"11 16, 2020",Most Reliable Car I’ve ever had,This car is great interior wise and a very smooth ride to be a part of. I don’t care for the outside but being inside makes you forget what it looks like.
"11 12, 2020",It is very comfortable car,"This car is roomy, family-style car. Good for short and long distances. Only one concern that doesn't has screen and i cannot listen music, i want.  But i got a bunch of CD's . Lol. Overall RAV4 is comfortable, great value for its money and i recommend it. PS. Upgraded to 2020 and happier with music options"
"11  8, 2020",Great all around car,"Owned car since 34k currently has 400k and still going strong, usual brakes rotors pads maitnence. Weird grinding noise sometimes at 40-70km/h speeds. Had driveshaft knuckle replaced, no fix, replaced transmission, helped no fix. Apparently it's a unknown common problem with the model. 4 wheel drive works slick and never got into trouble I couldn't get out of, have done quite a bit of off roading, ride is stiff but tolerable"
"10  7, 2020",RAV4 are the BEST!,"Since my first RAV4 back in the day, I've only ever driven a RAV4.  It's the perfect vehicle for fun, comfort, road trips, beach car, garden car, sports gear, while still being a grown up and driving it to fancy events with pride.  Super reliable - this car (nor its predecessors) have been in the shop for anything besides scheduled maintenance.  The ONLY reason I'm transitioning from this car is because I have three young men with lots of buddies and we need at long last a larger vehicle.  I have driving this car as a single, safe driver since 2012 when I purchased it practically new with very few miles on it.  I've only put 8k miles per year, total of 80.862 at current odometer reading."
"09 14, 2020",Fast and fun to drive.Lots of room.,"My V6 limited is everything I ever wanted.It is fast.Lots power to tow with. Sicks to the road.Huge compartment under the back hatch.Rear seats fold down easily for hauling things.I was going to get a 4 runner.So fare I haven't found any I can't fit inside or tow behind.I have a hitch for a basket or to tow my 6x10 trailer with 2  4x4  4 wheeler's and all my camping supplies.I can't say enough about the power and how it grips the road.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs I have lots of leg room, head room ,The seat will go back even more for someone with longer legs."
"06 24, 2020",This car is exceptional. Great value,"Handles really well in snow, great cargo space, roof rack, extra storage. We took long trips and never feared. Back seats fold nicely - you can easily move a small apartment. Beautiful ride."
"05 14, 2020",Don't discount this small dealer.... Nice cars,"I was really pleased.  Looked up many cars in the price point, most were beat to death.  Drove to Kaysville, and this small shop was great.  We were very picky, and very happy with the purchase.  We even consigned our other car to this dealer, because they were NOT SHADY, but decent people.  Due diligence for all car purchases is necessary, but they passed with flyilng colors."
"03 14, 2020",This RAV4 is very clean perfect engine cold A/c,"Toyota 4cylinders Gas saver perfect suspension .
My price is one of the best on the market.  Very well maintained clean tires. 
Can take the best offer"
"03 13, 2020",EXCELLENT VEHICLE,The Rav4 is perfect vehicle for every situation. It's the last V6 you can find in a compact SUV and definitely has more power. I compared it to the Forester XT before buying but it wasn't even close. Very comfortable and gets around in the mud and off-road great.
"02 15, 2020",Very nice vehicle!,This vehicle was purchase for my granddaughter. She in College at Purdue University. 4 cylinder engine which is awesome on gas. She loves it and all for friends enjoy it too.
"01 29, 2020",I fell in love with the car as soon as i tested it,I love it! Absolutely one of the best cars I've ever own.  I've only had it for a few days but i cam tell it will last me for years with minimal issues
"01  6, 2020",This car  was a perfect car i ever have,This is a nice car drive smooth and clean inside outside no issue and nice interior design it sunroof backup camera the car is perfect condition
"12 18, 2019",Great car!!!,Starts right up. I have not had any problems with the car. Great condition on the inside and out. Lot more room then I thought it would have. Lots of storage areas as well. Will buy from Carvana again as well.
"12 16, 2019",Love our RAV4,"Comfortable and efficient. The only thing we don't like is that the back door does not have a lock on it. Toyota has not been willing to install a lock. When the battery died in a public parking lot, a maintenance person put a charger on reversed and fried the electrical system. We could not lock the rear hatch. Other than this one design flaw, we love the RAV4."
"12  5, 2019",best reliable car i owened,"IT HAS PLENTY OF LEG ROOMS,3rd row with extra seat( it can be fold). The 2010 Toyota RAV4 ranks near the top of the compact SUV class. It offers a comfortable interior, a pleasant ride, loads of cargo space, plus good safety and reliability ratings."
"11 21, 2019",Drove nice,Overall good riding car just wasn't for me. I was looking for more features then what this vehicle had it was a basic model. Had excellent milage for the year it was.
"11  4, 2019",Same oil leak over and over,I felt Rav had a great reputation so I bought one. I had problem after problem with it and wouldn't recommend. I kept having a seal go on it and leaking oil.  The ride wasn't that good. I owned it for about 4 years.
"10 27, 2019",It’s Toyota RAV4 speak its self,If all cars could let you down touts rav4 will never . Electronically mechanical it’s amazingly made so tough to cross over 200k on mileage yet they still strong and for sure they still hold their price value price that they are an amazing cars and well made
"10 18, 2019",Very satisfied with this car and plan to keep it.,This car is perfect for my needs. I primarily use it to drive to work and visiting family. I am very satisfied with the car's performance and value.
"08 26, 2019",Made all plastic paint pulling off makes nose like,I wished I never bought it's been nothing but trouble taken in for recall something about key intion horn never worked since paint pulling of
"07 25, 2019",Meets our Needs,"We specifically wanted a RAV4 with a V6 engine, which was discontinued in 2012. The engine has a lot of punch, which gives you confidence in passing and crossing mountain passes. This car also has ample cargo space and a roof rack that we will probably use to transport kayaks. We will be keeping this car in our vacation home in Idaho. We have owned several Toyotas over the years (including 2 other RAV4's) and love that they are so reliable and durable!"
"06 25, 2019",Everything you'd expect from a Toyota,"The Rav4 is a great little suv. Runs smooth and has great power with the v6. This is our 2nd Rav4 with the v6 and the first one ran just as strong and smooth at 140,000 as it did the day we bought it. Did a great job of keeping us going last year during a snow storm of  8"" to 10"" in northern Minnesota."
"04  2, 2019",Great car!,This is the high end model and I love it. Was in good condition. Had a flat but also had a full size spare in great comfy.
"04  1, 2019",Very satisfied so far.  Only drove it for one day.,So far it is just great.  You sent this to me too early in the purchase.  I would suggest you wait at least a week before sending out reviews.
"03 27, 2019",I've owned a Rav for 5 yrs ... still in love,"I bought my Rav in 2014, it had 97,000kms at the time. It's currently got 230,000kms and still going strong af. I love the styling of the Rav... it's functional as well as being pretty modern ...for it's age. I get an everage i  the summer of 9.4 l/100km and in the winter it's about 10.3(Tires totally a factor). I drive 25 mins each way to work on a highway, averaging 110 km/h. I'm lucky that I have the 2.5L Base, AWD ...it's basic but still rocks in the snow and ice. I've outfitted it with a set of 16"" Gislaved Nord Frost for the winter and have always run Toyo 17""in the summer. I use only synthetic oil now for high mileage vehicles and have treated her to a oxygen sensor clean each summer as well. Having a little suspension issue now but given the KMs and our absolute xxxxe roads in Nova Scotia, it's to be expected. I have 2 kids and the space inside is more than ample for 2 car seats and all our gear.  Paint and interior have held up AMAZINGLY well for what we put it through .. .. I even use it to haul wood for the woodstove, both towed with a trailer and loads in the cargo area when super snowy and the wheelbarrow won't do. Having the diff lock is one of the main reasons I bought the Rav over the CRV, Forester and all other competitors. I've been in a ton of situations where it's been a blessing. Remember, 4 low or diff lock isn't meant to get you in ... it's meant to get you out! Cheers!"
"03 26, 2019",It is the most reliable car I have owned,"It has never given me any issues, all the maintenance it needed was the regular synthetic oil change (my preference of oil) and filters but that's about it, I had never had to take it to the mechanic for any issues, all i had to do was change the battery but that's about it. Very reliable, it drives smoothly and very comfortable."

Superb power yet great fuel economy from optional V4; huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height; comfortable ride; responsive handling."
"03  3, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"Purchased this car new for my wife.  Has basically been bullet proof with very little need for mechanical repairs.  It's understandable why these cars routinely exceed 200,000 miles and more in their lifetime."
"02 11, 2019",My favorite vehicle I have ever had,My favorite vehicle I have ever had. I had an after market radio installed in the vehicle when I bought it and everyone is very impressed with the car and it is a comfortable ride.
"02  9, 2019",Great price for a reliable car with upgrades.,Meets all of the expectations of a Toyota. It is perfect for my needs. Sunroof and rear camera unexpected features. Great performance and value. The Toyota dealership told me I got a great deal.
"01 26, 2019",Good buy. A limited edition with very low miles!!,Sporty & luxury. Good back end space with rubber mat a must! Leg room comfortable & room for child's car seat  Has a nice v6 vroom to it!
"01  8, 2019",Love it!,I love this vehicle.  2nd RAV4 that I’ve owned and I’m really happy with it.  Handles well in poor weather which is frequent in MN. Great size as well.
"12  9, 2018",extremely reliabal v6 2wd handles like sports car,I bought car used with 20000 miles it now has 50000. I love it I am going to keep this car as long as possible
"11 30, 2018",Will NEVER buy a toyota again,"I bought a brand new 2010 RAV4, lovingly cared for and pampered this car.  However, even with great maintenace this car turned out to be a nightmare.  This car was recalled so many times, i just stacked the notices, then when i incured obvious rear end problems like leaking seals and slipping differential,  the dealer wanted $105. to inspect the recall, nice.  Then in 2018 noticed gas mileage decreasing and a strange noise and vibration, after investigating it at 130,000. miles found out the torque converter and lockup clutch was bad.  Decided to get rid of it before it got any worse.  When looking for a different car, many dealorships without even looking or drving my car for trade in, said they wouldnt touch my car with a 10 foot pole because of known transmission problems with that brand and car.  So got lucky one day and traded it in to a busy chevy dealorship that never drove the car and only received 8100 on a chevy truck.  Needless to say, I will never own or buy a toyota again!!!!!!"
"10 28, 2018","Extremely reliable, versatile midsize SUV","Bought new. 218,000 miles so far and no service issues. Comfortable. 23mpg. Enough space to be useful or hold 5 adults.  Quick but not powerful. Nice handling for an SUV. 
One negative - the 4WD is only engaged under 25mph."
"10 23, 2018",Awesome awd suv!,I absolutely love this rav 4 for getting around in the harsh winters and it gets great gas mileage for our traveling adventures. It also has a good amount of space in the back to pack things in!
"10 23, 2018","100,000 miles of reliability","We have 100,000 miles on our 4 wheel drive V6 RAV4. I really love this car. The only problem it has/had is that we noticed a small leak under the engine two years ago. My mechanic said it was the rear main engine seal, and would cost $3000 to fix. We decided we could live with a minor weeping seal, which was his recommendation. It stopped leaking not long after. All fluid levels are normal, so I consider it a non-issue. Now to the positives: You can sleep in the back, as long as you put a small board down to cover the 3 inch gap. When loaded up with 4 people including climbing and camping gear it will go 80 miles an hour uphill all day long. We drive from Seattle to LA every xmas and that thing is a little sports car. It's fantastic in the snow...though that may be due more to the 4 studded snow tires. The seats feel great, even though we have the simple ones. Inside of the car is plastic...but so what? It works. Nothing has broken in 8 years. It has the original starter, water pump, radiator, alternator, everything.  I've had to do brakes of course. We love Toyotas. I've got a 2004 tacoma with 240k on the original engine and clutch! And we have a 1991 Corolla that has 365,000 on the original engine and transmission. It's the unkillable car. I just put on the third radiator. 4th gear on the Corolla  doesn't work anymore, but 4th is over rated. We go straight to 5th."
"09 23, 2018",Never see a Toyota on the side of the road,This was my first car that I actually purchased it was very great to me and my kids very low maintenance required on it great on gas it was very dependable when I finally traded it in it had over a hundred and fifteen thousand miles but it was still running so great and I really didn't want to trade it in because I loved it
"08 12, 2018",Most reliable car in the planet.,"Overall, I just feel in love with this car. I really like the exterior style designed and safety features as described. It's an eye-catching car on the roads. Love it!!! :)"
"08  8, 2018",I love the V6 269HP Limited,"It will run..I mean top speed 135 maybe more.
And real quick 50 to 80mph in a flash.
Ill say more after i tow my 5x8 bike trailer this weekend. IM GOING To lift mine and add skid plates from front to back .Then keep it forever."
"07 25, 2018",This v6 limited Rav 4 will run .130MPH PLUSE,"Its all about the 269hpV6 for me..This Rav is the quickest thing i ever owned.It goes ftom 50 to 80 in seconds..Goes good in snow wet grass dirt and with the right tires even mud..My stero sounds really good its the JBL..It came with a sub in the rear hatch door.
I was going to add one but decided i didn't need it.
I added a hitch and can tow 3500lbs if i want to.
I found a 2 inch coil spring lift from Deaver im going to put on.It will give me 3 1/2 more inches of space between the finder n tire so i can go up 3 or 4 sizes if i want..Pluse they will make the rear spring extra heavy duty and add 500lbs of hauling n towing capacity. 
I live in WV.Lots of hills n mountains. Completely loaded i can go as fast as i want up any hill with more then enough power to pass anything in my way..
I cant say enough good things about my rav. 
I run it really hard up n down hills n mountains loaded going to my camp in the mountains getting over 20mpg..If someone else would drive it would get 25mph or more..Im so happy i picked my Rav 4 over a jeep wrangler."
"07 21, 2018",The best small family car,My wife and I love this car. We haven't had any issue after owning in for 4 years and putting on 90K miles. The only way we ever get rid of it is if our family outgrows it
"07 20, 2018",Very smooth drive,Spacios the trunk and seats good power stroke over hills very reability comforth to the passenger and kids very stabiler automobile good suspension make sure for stop good driving over freeway in city too
"06 22, 2018",Get the RAV4,"I got a used 2010 rav4 limited with 80k miles on it for $11,700 after talking them down & its a really comfortable and smooth ride.  Its a nice looking vehicle, got a lot of compliments on it. I love the look of it. Perfect size for an SUV.  Easy to pull in & out of tight parking, great turning radius. Cant beat the 4WD either.  4WD is way better than AWD and getting harder to find.  I test drove other suv's; dodge journey & ford edge since I have an 04' Xterra that was just totaled & i wouldnt settle until i found another 4WD & the rav4 outbeat them by far. Never thought i would like another suv as much as my Xterra. It actually gets up speed pulling out & going uphills way quicker than my xterra did & that was a 6cylinder so that was a surprise. Plenty of cargo space & it has another hidden cubby for even more space in the back and the back seats recline individually for passenger comfort which is pretty cool. It also has push buttons to put the back seats down for even more cargo space. Great on gas and it gets up and goes really quick for a 4cylinder.  Really roomy inside. Glad I went with the rav4 especially after reading thru 100's of reviews & reading all about the other engine & trans issues on other suv's until my eyes burned outta my head & test driving the other junk.  My neighbor tried buying it from me the day after i brought it home b/c he liked it so much. He ended up finding the exact same one in the same color and all for his wife with 60k miles on it so now we have matching cars...smh.  get the rav4 if you're having trouble deciding."
"06  9, 2018",Reliability and Comfort,I have had the Toyota Rav4 2010 for 5 years and never experienced any issues! Bought it used with very high milage and even so only regular maintenance and care is all it needs to continue for many more years. It has come in handy to carry furniture and large amounts of boxes/merchandise. Very spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly large leg room in the back seats. No complaints!
"06  1, 2018","Fuel efficient, Reliable SUV","We've owned this vehicle about 5yrs and its been a tank during this time, pretty much just the basic maintence, add gas and go. Even though its a fwd version, feels equally competent in the snow.

Even though its the base model, and is a few years old still looks stylish for its age and rides well."
"05 30, 2018",This Vehicle is CHERRY!,"Vehicle has all 3 controls ( Steering, Gas and break )on both left and right of car. Vehicle could be used for mail deliveries or driving instructor! Or car could be converted back to regular vehicle."
"05 29, 2018",Same like hinds,Small size engine. Beautiful looking and Drive sweet.  The price was also very great and I bought it at end of the month so the deal was supper. I am saving gas now
"05 28, 2018",Great Dependable Car,"We  love our Toyota Rav 4.It is super dependable, it has tons of room, and very stylish. Would not trade it for anything. best thing of all is every SUV out there looks the same except the Rav4"
"05 14, 2018",Awesome Handling,Met and surpassed my needs. It has  all the space I need for transporting kids and all the features I wanted also.A delight to drive.
"05  4, 2018",Perfect Car,"Love this car. It has been so reliable. No major mechanical problems just routine things like oil changes, brakes, and tires. The 4WD is great in the winter months. Plenty of room for me and my two sons. I love this car."
"04 26, 2018",Love Toyota!,"Though I just bought my Toyota Rav4 had to avoid highways back to work, but the construction was crazy! My Toyota handled like a pro, the roads were torn up and in some cases only dirt with holes to avoid, Escaped a Cement Truck that didn't have a spotter, and the general drivers strattling to get around you. Handled great, can't wait to take her on a road trip with weekend!!!"
"04  9, 2018",I am very happy with my car,I have no complaints with my car. I enjoy driving it. It gives a nice ride. Solid car and comfortable. It has always been dependable. Would buy another one.
"04  4, 2018",Great winter and Beach car!,"I bought it used in 2014 with only 19K miles, Limited Edition and fell in love.   More comfortable than my 1998 Subaru Forester on the road ( was a very reliable vehicle That I sold to my mechanic with @170K once repairs got expensive).  Color is Blizzard White Pearl  which is so  safe color for night driving but a pain to 
match  if  you want to fill in chips yourself.  Gas mileage average is 21 mpg but they are more efficient now and the ugly spare tire cover is gone which has to be hand washed due to nooks and crannies.   I like the trunk door that opens sideways vs over your head.  Only issue is city parking that doesn?t always allow to open it completely.   Suspension and visibility is excellent. Has a small 2? by 2? backup camera in the rear view mirror.  Radio and speakers are great with optional subscription to Sirius and 6 CD player.  Heated leather seats are an asset in the cold winter months.   Fits a lot of beach gear and other bulky items.    Steering wheel has Bluetooth and radio controls to reduce distractions!   Very good safety ratings."
"03 31, 2018",hard on gas very noisy,Always wanted one as time went by got to hate this rav4 rough ride bangs over bumps wind noise on the highway is terrible it is just poor ride quality won't buy another
"03 12, 2018",Toyota is basically another name for reliability.,"I am generally not a person that likes to own a vehicle identical to what everyone else has. Obviously there are so many Rav4's on the road that it was excellent to be able to purchase a limited edition model that you do not see a lot of on the road. Mine was the Rav4 Sport with the AWD, V6, and Sport Appearance Package. This package had to be custom ordered from the dealer because the sport appearance did not come with the V6 AWD. I had a Subaru WRX and when I moved to the Rav4 as a more family oriented SUV, a little bigger, I was happy I did not lose power. The 270hp engine is super punchy and makes this vehicle like no other. Never had a single problem with it after 8 years of ownership. No check engine lights, no sensor failures, no nothing. Just the best in reliability I have ever owned. Interior is comfy and back seats have great adjustability and fold down flat. Interior road/wind noise is on the average for the type of vehicle. Not a luxury vehicle in road noise performance, but way quieter than a WRX for example. Another plus is that it is built well and after 8 years does not even show a single rust spot on the body unique my previous Jeep that seemed to just react with water when wet. Excellent value and no complaints what so ever!"
"02 22, 2018",Gets me from A to B,"It being a used older vehicle it's hard to say what the previous owner has done to it. Right off the bat my exhaust was blown though. Then there is the whole 4WD thing... I've never once seen the 4WD or VSC light come on when I'm sure I could have used it. (in 30cm of snow) It's always felt as though it is in Front Wheel Drive, which is fine for my gas mileage but the traction of 4WD would be nice. I've heard sooo many raving reviews of the Toyota RAV4 for it's reliability. I hope that's what the future holds for us. For now it does the trick."
"02 20, 2018",Very reliable.,"Toyota reliability.  Gets good fuel economy, in town and on the hwy, despite having 4wd and the capabilities of a light duty SUV.  Works for me."
"02 12, 2018",Love this vehicle!,"The interior is comfortable and stylish.  I love the cargo space, especially that the second row seats fold down flat - sliding larger, heavier items in is so easy.  And I also love the hidden storage.  The one thing I don't like:  the spare tire cover is very difficult to remove.  But I haven't needed to remove it except when I bought new tires, and then the service man did it for me."
"02 12, 2018",Fantastic Car for the Exploring Family,"We bought this RAV4 new 8 years ago.  It has been a fantastic family car.  We've taken on numerous cross-country trip, up mountains and through forests.  It's never let us down and has keep us comfortable and happy.  

And all that enjoyment has been hassle free mechanically.  It's been well taken care of with oil changes and repeated alignments.

The only reason we are selling this car is because our children have left the nest.  We are down-sizing to a Leaf and would love for this car to find a family to keep it going on adventures."
"01 20, 2018",nice car .,"very economic. i had other car cars all this years , but this is the best car out of 8 cars cars in the last 32 years, very economic in gas ."
"01  9, 2018",An SUV that can get me anywhere I want to go.,I needed a SUV that could get in anyplace I wanted to go and in any type of weather.  Also I wanted leather heated seats.  This is the one for me.
"12 14, 2017",i love it,"After driving the Pilot, Ridgeline, Highlander, Santa Fe, and several others, the Sorento EX V6 was by far the best value for my money. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like a Lexus and it handles almost like a sedan. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! On my first 500+ mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. If you're looking for a new crossover in this segment, put this one on your short list to test drive."
"12 13, 2017",The roomiest compact SUV,"Despite not being the most Luxurious or powerful in the class it is incredibly useful vehicle.  It's trunk is huge, the folding seats are very easy to use, the cabin feels more like a large SUV with a lot of leg room on both rows. The AWD is working well and got me out from snow where many other SUVs got stuck (I guess it depends on tires as well though). In 7 years that I had this car I had 1 minor fix- very reliable."
"11 25, 2017","Solid mid size SUV,  always holds its resale valvu","Reliable , No random maintainence issues other than basics required . Limited editions are much nicer inside out."
"11 20, 2017",love this car!,I've owned this car for the past 4 years now and it has been my absolute favorite. Very reliable and a perfect family car.
"11 13, 2017",Dependable and Good on Gas Car I own now,I enjoy the power buttons and the leg room and the heated seats. I also like how you can set the radio stations just by doing them on the steering wheel. I also like how the spare tire is not in the trunk like other cars I have owned. It is great for those family members or friends who use walkers and they fit easily in the back in the car.
"10 12, 2017",A Rave for RAV4,"The best vehicle that I've ever owned.  Well-designed, comfortable, an outstanding performer.  The RAV4 is highly recommended."
"10  3, 2017",Most reliable and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is a great ride for a small SUV. It is larger than the current batch of newer ones and has tons of storage space. Is a very attractive vehicle with all the bells and whistles for this year of vehicle. Nice sporty style with additional options like the moon roof which is very easy to use, roof rails, exterior tire (which adds more space inside), cargo net and cargo cover. Has a very large cargo space compared to other small SUV's and has been a joy to own. I wish the newer Rav 4s had as much space as this one and the same high ground clearance."
"09 13, 2017",Excellent condition!!!,"Clean car, low mileage, priced much lower than the same cars available in the market.
already inspected. new tires. really clean condition car"
"09  5, 2017",Good car for a family,Solid car for a family. Great relaibilty. Good on off road surfaces. Overall great suv for a family.
"09  5, 2017","Durability, is the best description!","is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"08 29, 2017",Super Commuter Car!,"For my commute? Perfect. For a long trip I would prefer my minivan. My only, and ONLY real complaint with this car is the ding-dang cup-holders are tucked almost under the radio. A 20oz cup has issues and most refillable water bottles do not fit. That said, I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  It's been 7 years and aside from the routine stuff (oil, brake pads, wipers, battery) I've only had to replace a water pump.  That pretty much screams quality!"
"08  6, 2017",Incredibly practical. Great for all lifestyles.,"Practical car. Reliable, lots of space, decent on gas, good for all lifestyles. Love how the trunk opens up sideways."
"07  3, 2017",I love the style,"Nice small SUV that has enough cargo space for my needs.
It's really simple interiors design.
It's smooth ride also."
"06 22, 2017",So good I am sorry to have to sell it!,"Great comfy SUV. Dependable and fun to drive. 
Selling only because we need bigger people mover. Only negative is the back Up camera in this model is not great."
"06 19, 2017",great car,has lots of room for a smaller car handlers very well we love are's  good family car  rides smooth has a great sound system too
"05 29, 2017",Love this car,Only owned it a short time (used to have subaru forester) but love the way it handles nice quiet ride plenty of room inside. Would definitely recommend to car.
"05  7, 2017",Good family car,It's a very reliable car and worth the money. I have not had any problems with it even at 7 years of owning it.
"05  4, 2017",Best Small SUV I could find,"I like it. Aside from the issues I have had that were unique to the way the previous owner/dealership took care of it and repairs that were done, it's been great. It gets good gas mileage, and has plenty of room for me, my friends, and all of my adventure gear."
"04 11, 2017",Love my RAV4!!,"Fun to drive, ease of handling and reliability.  Been a loyal Toyota owner for over 20 years.  Will probably continue to be one for the next 20!!!"
"04  9, 2017",Good car for the price,"We purchased this vehicle for a good price, good shape, interior nice and runs pretty good so far as we have only had it for about 2 weeks but so far so good."
"04  5, 2017",Great Experience,One of the best experiences I have ever had at a dealership. I am looking forward to buying my truck from this dealership in the near future.
"04  2, 2017",Great car,"Great car, lots of power for small SUV. I recommend buying the V6 since you get the same mpg as the 4 cylinder. Nothing wrong with more power"
"03  6, 2017",Good choice for a used vehicle,"I purchased '10 Rav-4 a month ago, with 66k.
I'm very pleased so far this car.  It was a good purchase price from Center Subaru.  Time will tell"
"01  8, 2017",Great for what it is.,"Basic, reliable transportation.   Just bought it ... 51,000 miles.  Will find out.  The CD player seems temperamental.  There front window is noisy with a lot of whistling.  Otherwise, the car seems find.  I have also a Honda Accord which feels more solid.  Not so 'tinny' when I shut the door.  However, the RAV4 is just as comfortable."
"02 19, 2016",I've loved this car!,"I bought my RAV4 Limited in 2013 used with about 40k miles on it and it has 80,000 now. I'm currently in the market to trade up to a newer year 6-cylinder RAV4 with less mileage. The V6 is a lot of fun and unfortunately was discontinued for 2013. My gas mileage averaged 26 mpg in the summer and around 23 in the winter.

Driving is responsive and fun. The stereo in my car was upgraded to the 9-speaker JBL system which is GREAT. The bluetooth, satellite radio and phone systems are somewhat antiquated I felt compared to what you could get in other vehicles, but easy to learn and use and the sound quality was good.

4 wheel-drive performance was excellent - it has a button on the console to send drive power to all four wheels up to 25 mph to get you out of tough spots, and there is over 8 inches of ground clearance to take you somewhat off road if you need to be! In everyday driving, it's comfortable and reliable. Winter driving without 4x4 is also excellent.

There is also downhill assist and traction control - the downhill assist slows the engine WAY down when you're in the lowest gear so that you creep down hills slower than you ever could in first gear without braking constantly.

No problems at all with this car other than the recalls that have been stacking up!"
"09 22, 2015",Love my used 2010 Toyoto Rav4~,I was driving a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and I have RA and getting in and out really hurt my back. I can just turn around and sit in the seat of my Rav! I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage although it could be worse. I've only had it for a month and have taken in on a 1000 mile vaca and loved it even more. If I don't have any trouble out of it I will keep it till it literally falls apart. I love it so much I have to give her a name cause she is going to be so much a part of our family. car seat and booster seat for grandkids fit great and I feel safe with them in this vehicle.
"04 20, 2015",2010 RAV4,"Not a ""drivers"" car much like most Toyotas; rides like a boat with little road feed-back. Good brakes but you have to look outside to tell that they are working. Seat adjustments are for smaller folks - I am 5'11"" and have the seat ratcheted all the way back and I still feel cramped a bit (my wife loves it though). Great room in back with many space arrangement options, Dealer fixed a factory defect promptly with no hassle. Ride is floaty-rough; could use quieter tires that Michelins on now though they perform very well. Disappointed with 25 MPG (I get 29-31 with my Honda Accord). Upgrade sound is excellent and fault-free."
"06 17, 2014",Happy with my Toyota...,"My salesperson Jean Eddy Mores did an excellent job. I appreciate going out on the rain to check my Toyota :) He made sure our needs were met, he was very courtious and patient. I never leased a car before. This was so easy the sales person went with us all the way. Now he is a friend. Thank you for looking a masculine car for my husband...
Thank you"
"10  7, 2013",Great Ride and Comfort,Easy to maneuver; great rear view for backing up. More room inside than many of the co.mpetitors that are larger
"09 14, 2013",Very good SUV,"Great on gas, very spacious and good for long trips!. Mine came with third row seat which is awesome. So far no a single complain."
"08  2, 2013",Satisfied owner,"I have only driven this car a 1000 miles, but it starts when I put the key in. It was a good value. See me next year for a more informed review..."
"06 29, 2013",Wrong Car,"We ended up buying a 2012. I believe it was listed on cars.com by a Caddy dealer. I know it's buyer beware, but many of the prices for the RAV were way over for the time period and year we were looking for. Also, they tried to lure you to them with untrue promises. We were lucky and car runs fine."
"05 16, 2013",Wow what a great car,"We traded in a Corolla for the 2010 RAV4 and although we have only had it for a short time, we LOVE it. My husband rarely drove the Corolla but I can see he is going to be using the RAV alot. Being retired I was looking for a vehicle that would provide great comfort and thought the looks of the RAV were great. We got the limited and are very impressed so far with all the features. I am so happy I searched and found the car I have been wanting."
"05 10, 2013",Love my Toyota!,"I got great customer service and they really worked with me on the price. I had a budget to stay within and they worked with me to make that happen. I love owning a Toyota! It is very reliable to drive and looks good, which makes me look good!"
"03 22, 2013",Happy so far,Very happy with the vehicle so far. Had it less than a month so can't really comment on reallity so just gave a 4 star based on others reviews.
"03 12, 2013",Love the v6,Fourth RAV4 and so glad that I went for the v6 version w/ this one. I would not go back to a 4 cylinder. The problem is that for 2013 that's all you can get. I'd miss the power. This car has been super reliable and fun to drive. I can get anywhere (snow and mud) and enjoy the gas mileage.
"11 26, 2012",Great Great Vehicle-TOYOTA PLEASE FIX TRANS WHINE!,"The car is very nice inside and out. Ne never had any trouble with the car. Value is great. Quality is very good except for the nagging transimission whining noise from 20-50 MPH or so that has been on all ravs for about a decade. This at times leads to transmisio n failure, and most of the time it is no problem. Now there is a TSB on it with a mount fix that leads nowhere then a trans replacement that does the trick. Good luck convincing them to do anything without a lot of pressure. Getting back to the vehicle, it really is great though besides the noise. It is soo much more than you realize at first. The inside may appear plain but it is actually just nice and simple and de cluttered. LOTS of room and handles GREAT!! Acceleration is like a rocket. There are times where it does not down shift at low speeds like 25mph and is a shocker. Dealer said it is normal due to drive patterns and fuel economy needs. Glove box has a plastic shock that pops off the stub all the time so that you just leave it. The map lites are in the same area as the dome lite in front so when you push it you forget to turn it off thinking it is the dome lite. Then there is not a battery saver that shuts this off. Base steering wheel even is soo comfortable. It has really nice tapers on the spoke coroners. Runs great on 87, great MPG and Power. Tires tend to round or wear on the sides befor e the middle, it may be the tires or the stabilzer makes the car feel so square that when you take an off ramp you go fast and puts a lot of load on the edge of the tires. Love this car. Evey through the little things, no doubt a must have car!! Love it love it love it!!!"
"10 10, 2012",Near Perfect,"I have to say, I wish this car was built in Detroit. The exterior styling is a bit wonky but, like consumer reports said, it's a near perfect SUV. I have a 2010 limited with 3.5L V6 and have put 30k miles on it. The leather seats are comfortable, there's class leading room in the rear seat for two grandparents and car seat. The cargo room is like 37 sq ft with the seats up. That's 1/3 more than the Cayenne and GLK etc. It's plenty fast with almost like 275hp and not as heavy as other SUVs. It's got a backup camera IN THE REARVIEW mirror! I've tried to replace this SUV with something else 20 times due to the RAV being ubiquitous. Nothing comes close. All competing SUVs either cost way more, get way worse mileage, have less rear seat room, less cargo room, or are less reliable or all of the above. It's the pinnacle SUV right now, especially with gas prices at $5."
"09  2, 2012",Pleasant Surprise,"I'm previously owned a Celica (168K mi.), 2 Camrys (266K mi. and 173K mi.) and was looking into a change of Toyota product. Because of its good reviews, I decided on the 2010 Rav4 Limited, V6 FULLY loaded with almost 40K miles. For the last few months this vehicle has been a pleasant surprise...comfortable ride, quick, responsive acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6, looks great and plenty of room for cargo or our Labrador. Its only been a short time, but, so far...LOVE IT!"
"08  1, 2012",Nice Car,"I bought the 2010 Rav4 Sport. Ive owned it a little over a month and have put approx 3000 miles on it. There is no spare tire on this model unlike the Base Rav4 or Limited Rav4. It has run flat tires that seem loud in the interior when driving. To combat the loud tires I turn up the stereo (cd, am, fm & sat) and the stereo sound is not real good. There is an upgrade to this stereo I would recommend if your into music, find a model with the upgraded stereo. The vehicle also has a 4 cylinder motor, not bad for running around town or to work and back. I test drove the v6 and its like a rocket, it would be nice to have the get up and go when you step on the gas. The interior is well designed with easy access to all the controls. The gas millage is excellent compared to my last vehicle and Im averaging around 24 mpg. The drivers seat is average, mine is not power or leather and that makes a big difference in comfort. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV."
"06  5, 2012",Rav4 Rocks!,"This is my SECOND Rav4. The first one only being taken away (literally) due to it having been totalled out in a wreck. It was a 2007, had 145,000 miles and we still received an EXTREMELY fair check from the insurance company. It paid for a slightly newer, fancier Rav with only 20,000 miles. The insurance adjuster was even surprised at what a ""salvaged"" Rav 4 was worth. The car literally never gave me any trouble. I changed the oil rarely on time, which I don't recommend and quite often went thousands of miles over and yet that car kept driving. We only put new tires on the vehicle 4 times, new brakes after 125,000 miles on the FACTORY brakes and changed the oil in this vehicle. We did do the recommended dealer inspections/spark plug replacement, etc. but other than that, this car ran like a well tuned engine the entire life of the car. We were even laughing that even due to the high miles, we would not need a new one for another 2 years! The interior on our original Rav was base, a bit noisier than our Camry was, but overall, acceptable road noise. The interior of the cabin of both the 2007 and our current 2010 model are designed around the driver. The only complaint we have found so far is the cupholders in the front seat are so close to the drop of the dash board that when you remove a ""Super Size"" cup from the cupholder, it knocks up against the bottom of the dash and will often knock the lid off and spill the drink or crush the cup. As a consequence, you have to tilt the cup to get it out of the cup holder to avoid knocking the lid off, which will sometimes unseat the lid anyway! The interior of this model is a higher end vehicle and rides much quieter and more comfortable which is to be expected with the number of upgrades (from a Base model to a Limited model). The leg room seems to be a problem in the backseat for our 13 year old recently as he is now 5'11"" so I don't recommend this vehicle if you are toting leggy teens more than a few hours. It is comfortable though and the rear seats recline which aids in the leg room issue. The seat also adjusts forward/backward as does the front seat by a bar underneath the seat which is helpful when carrying items behind the rear seat. The amount of carry space when the rear seat is up or down is amazing. We compared it to the Highlander and it is a great deal more. I have YET to be loaded to the max in this vehicle and we use it for our business carrying boxes either flat or packed from one point to another. There are interior ""hidden"" compartments as well underneath the rear floorboard that we have stuffed blankets and stadium seats into in the past along with ice chests, etc. It is amazing how much space this vehicle really has for such a small car. The exterior of the vehicle leaves a little lacking to be desired in style, but performs magically. Our vehicles sit outside all day and all night, not covered and after a recent SOFTBALL sized hail event, my husband's Ford F150 was dinged up pretty badly, my Rav, not a dint,nor ding ,nor chip of paint missing. When we purchased our first model, we got the 4 cylinder engine which was sufficient even driving in Dallas traffic and the gas mileage was wonderful. The 2010 Rav has the more powerful 6cylinder WITH tow package included and it only misses the gas mileage by a mile or two, a wonderful trade off when considering the amount of power we get with the 6 cyl engine. The vehicle shifts smoothly even at top speed when an extra burst is required for changing lanes in traffic and will get away from you at a red light if you are a heavy gas foot/jack rabbit start at the green!
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a vehicle for carrying items/smaller SUV. We purchased it as a low gas mileage dependable vehicle for business errands as well as errands for family and it has NEVER let us down, NEVER left us stranded AND NEVER failed to outperform any vehicle I have ever owned from luxury car to luxury LARGE SUV!"
"03 30, 2012",Very nice driver,"Lots of room for a small suv, great on gas easy to get in and out of parking lots.
Very comfortable, smooth and quiet."
"01 24, 2012",Very reliable brand,"The 2010 RAV 4 4 cylinder Automatic all wheel drive is very quiet to drive and provides great elbow and leg room for a family of 4. The 4 cylinder has great fuel economy and excellent acceleration. 2010 Rav 4 has several built in creature comforts - multiple cup holders - some adjustable to accommodate larger cup sizes. Also contains built in features to plug in iPod or other music storage devices. I decided on the 2010 Rav because my family was getting cramped in the 1999 Rav - but we really loved the reliability of the brand and vehicle. Toyota has improved styling, features and space (head room and leg room) in newer model years. I still drive my 1999 which has over 130,000 miles and still runs great. I expect the 2010 Rav to have the same reliability especially with how Toyota backs their vehicles. I have owned Corolla, Camry, and Rav, and would buy or recommend buying to anyone who asks. A bonus is many Toyota's are being produced in the US, so I am helping to support the US workforce."
"12  2, 2011",not relieable,"This car only has one hole to put a key into in the whole car..the dealer only gave us one remote control key which is very unhandy and dangerous.
We should of gotten two keys but they would NOt give us two keys..we already had the car in the shop twice since we bought it in a three weeks time.
I would not buy another RAV 4"
"10 20, 2011",LIMITED is GOOD...some tweaks would be nice.,"Purchased a late model 2010 in June 2011 (first owner was Oct 2010), w. 500 miles. This is primarily wife's commuter and our long-trip car. We have added 4500 miles on it 3 months. It is a Limited V6 auto, all leather interior, rearview camera, etc.... I think the interior leaves a little to be desired in comparison to others. I'm sure a comparable model with the same mileage and age would have been cheaper and have a better ""looking"" interior. But those brands cannot compete with the reliability or the durability of Toyota engines, exteriors and interiors. We expect to hold onto this for 10+ years so we also got the 100k bumper to bumper 8 year warranty and Platinum dealer service package. The V6 is very responsive with plenty of pickup. It is driven every day (avg 12 miles) in town/some interstate and is garage kept. The gas mileage is around 22-25m/g and up to 27m/g on interstate long (2+ hour) trips. The interior controls take a little getting used to. I prefer the mirror controls on the driver door vs. the center console. We have keyless entry/push button start which actually is safer and makes you more aware of where your keys are and what you are doing?we love this feature. But, I would have put the push button start on the left side of steering wheel instead of so close to temperature/radio controls. I've cut off the radio instead of the car more than once. Back seat riders have commented on how much leg room they have and the comfort of the seats. I would have expected rear temperature controls in a Limited. The ride is a little noisier (road contact not wind) than I would have expected for a top-of-the-line RAV4. The steering wheel feels a bit tiny but appropriate for the vehicle. It handles very well in parking lots (turn radius) and at high speeds (changing lanes). There are a lot of these on the road, because they are reliable. There are better LOOKING models from other brands, but the durability of them, IME, is 5-7 years. After that the interior, engines and exterior starts to falter. Aside from the small things mentioned above, I would not hesitate to buy another one. I think it's the perfect car for a married couple with 1 (maybe 2) small kid(s). I think if you have a teen you'll need to get a slightly larger vehicle. It's a joy to drive and Toyota's customer service is top notch."
"07  8, 2011",No-frills utilitarian dependable transport,"I was moving across the country, and the Rav4 was perfect as it had the most cargo volume in its class (36 cubic feet with the backseats up, and 70 with them down - both are tops in the compact crossover SUV segment).

Since purchasing the vehicle 10 months ago, I've now put on almost 10,000 miles on it. My FWD 4 cylinder model is EPA rated for 22/28 mpg, and in my real world experience I find it hard to achieve city driving of 22 mpg on an entire tank. Perhaps more like 18 to 20 mpg. On my cross country road trip, though, I was able to many times break 30 mpg on highway trips. In fact, my best tank clocked in at 32.5 mpg - pretty good. So maybe my experience of mileage is around 19/30. One thing to note - the on board mileage calculator is probably a bit generous. My own fill up measurements usually register around 1 or 2 miles lower.

The interior of the Rav4 is very ergonomic - everything where it should be, and nothing distracts from the road. There are lots of little storage areas for phones, maps, paperwork, coins, pens, cameras, etc. However, I felt that the back seat headrests are a little firm and flat, while the front seats are very cushioned and much more comfortable. One good thing though is that the back seats recline - which is a feature not always able to be had on some other SUVs.

The Rav4 is very agile and has a great turning radius. The acceleration is very sensitive and responsive at low speeds, which means the car is very quick coming out of a light or stop sign. At highway speeds, passing power a little less as good, though still adequate. Going up hills requires the engine to rev a bit.

Visibility is excellent for the most part. I feel the A pillars are a bit big, and I have to pay attention to check the sides at intersections as pedestrians on the crosswalk may get hidden in them.

Overall, I thought my purchase was an excellent value. I would recommend to those looking for lots of interior room on a budget, who are willing to sacrifice a luxurious pampering interior for a more utilitarian ergonomic small SUV that is very practical, quick, and fuel efficient compared to other cars that can deliver similar cargo volume."
"05 25, 2011","Good Car, But,","If you get this car make sure you get one with the upgraded stereo sound system already in the vehicle. The base stereo sucks. Also, had to have at least 3 Nav units replaced on this car. I really can not blame Toyota for this. I took the car to Car Toys and it really was not a better place to go. I finally got the stereo fixed by a dealership aftermarket stereo place and since then have been very happy with this small SUV. It gets 31MPG at 70MPH on the freeway. Thats a very impressive MPG considering that this is the 3.5 motor. The only anoying thing on this car is that the climate system automatically defaults to recercerculating air when the temp is reduced to it's lowest setting. It's irritating to constantly have to take the car off recerculate especially on a hot day when you don't want to run the AC."
"05 23, 2011",Great Overall Value,"I have owned the SUV for 6 months now from new. Only had two items needing correction a loose rearview mirrow screw. And a window rubber seal got caught when I rolled it up. They where easily fixed by the dealer The car came with no charge maintanence for 2yrs and 0% interest for 5yrs. We bought the V-6 Sport model with 4 wheel drive with run flat tires. Between the sport suspension and the run flat tires it rides a little hard at times on a bumpy road. It came with no spare on the back of SUV door but I prefer the look to the mounted tire on the back. It looks great and handles like a sports car. The power is excellant 0-60 in 6.2 seconds. It feels like a large SUV but it is only 182 inches. The second seat has a lot of leg room as big as any large SUV. The back hatch that opens from the side is great if you have a low garage door. Love the relining back seat. Great 2 glove boxes for storage. Speaking of storage. The SUV has plenty of storage areas for your phone, CD's, garage door opener, even a hidden storage in the floor of the trunk. It has a lot of new features like hill assist. limited slip differential, traction control, stability control. The dash looks a little on the cheap side but what do you expect in this price range. Excellant gas mileage and runs on regular gas. All and all it is a well rounded SUV. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Previous stationwagons where BMW and Mercedes. Except for the interior of the RAV the RAV has all the creature comforts you would find in a Stationwagon costing twice the price. I test drove the new redesigned BMW X3 for 2011 and I would stack it up to the BMW any day for 1/2 the price. I can see why MotorTrend gave Toyota ""Small SUV of the Year Award"" for 2006. I have owned Toyota's in the past and the reliabilty is excellant compared to the two German cars we owned. And the repair cost when and if it breaks down won't cost you nearly as much as a German car to repair."
"04 21, 2011",Not for snow,"This was my first leased SUV and I was so excited to finally have an SUV that had 4wd ability as I live out in the country of ND. It handled well in good weather, but there are a issues I noticed in the 7 months I have had the vehicle, especially over the winter months - the road grip is poor when the roads are wet or icy, and in snow, the tires pack so much snow into the wheelwell and caps that you have to clean them out or your AWD/4WD and braking system lights come on and your car shakes all over the place, and if you live in a place where there is lots of snow, that rear window wiper is a constant annoyance. Whenever you turn it on, and there is a lot of snowfall, it will get stuck midway by packed snow and it won't turn itself off - normally leading to a trip back to the dealer to get it fixed. Both need to be re-engineered, along with the coffee cup holders which keep coming out, and the car's seats which are not the most comfortable to sit on."
"04  3, 2011",2010 RAV4...4x4 (base),"i've owned the 2010 RAV4 (base model ) for 3 months...
(CONS) driver's seat - wish it was more comfy.., tilt & telescope steering wheel could be better,Sound system poor placement & quality fair/ average, some blind spots when backing out of parking space,paint is Average/fair. interior could be lil' better...

(PROS.) Does drive good, excels good...I'm getting about 25 MPG's,that's HYW & City (4cyl.)that i like! Handles good.does drive nice, i had no problem with snow this year, never even used the 4x4.,plenty of trunk space, rear-leg room a PLUS.

... Road trip in May to disney world, will see if it passes the long ride?"
"03 28, 2011",Great vehicle for the money.,"Owned for eight months since I leased this vehicle in July 2010. Positive: decent handling and acceleration compare to other Toyota, Honda, and Ford SUVs. Gas mileage is decent, 25MPG average for 4 cylinder 4x4, 70% city driving. Good visibility inside out. Excellent lease deal, $185 a month 15K a year. Two years free maintenance. Negative: Rear seats uncomfortable. Road noise. Poor dealership service experience. No steering wheel mounted controls unless you choose top of the line models."
"03 24, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,Excellent preformance in drive the 4 wheel drive is also good slightly poor in milage 21.5 mpg and good reliability smoot drive
"03 14, 2011",Suprising,"At first when I heard my mom wanted to buy an SUV I thought two things... boring and slow. After she did a little comparison between the RAV4, CRV, and Forester there was one clear winner. The Rav4 was much faster, more comfortable, and provided the same fuel economy as the competitors. She bought a 2010 Rav4 V6 Limited and has never looked back.So far she is extremely happy with her purchase. I must say that after driving the car myself the car is shockingly quick and nimble for an SUV, at least the V6 version is anyway. Overall it is a great car, and I would encourage anyone considering an SUV to at least test drive one."
"03 11, 2011","smooth acc., poor road grip poor coffee cup holder","the limited 2 wd is a much smoother car to drive than sports version or 4 wd. somewhat negative is its poor road grip in turning and on wet road. also, its coffee cup holders are very poorly designed."
"12 23, 2010",WELL PLEASED!!!!,"I have had this SUV for three months and am well pleased, thus far. I like the visibility you have of being higher up than in a car. Not sure but I think there is a blind spot when backing up. I have particularly noticed it when backing from from parking spaces in parking lots. Hope it is as good as my 1999 SOLARA that i just sold with 175,000 miles on it. The SOLARA was a wonderful car and was still very good when I sold it."
"12  4, 2010",Exactly what suits my needs,"This vehicle meets my needs because:
It drives and stops well in snow.
It is comfortable on a long drive.
It gets reasonable gas milage (26.5 mpg avg for 1200 miles, from Calif. to Washington state.)
The design and arrangement of the seats, controls, and storage inside is well thought out and functional.
I frequently drive on Forest Service roads and sometimes with some snow. I have really appreciated the safety features that keep the vehicle tracking straight under power and when breaking. We think it is a safe, reliable and efficient package for use around town, long trips, and traveling on the back roads in the wilderness.
I have towed my small sailboat, had my bike rack on it and hauled mountaineering gear up to the trailhead on snowy roads. All worked well."
"11  4, 2010",First SUV,"So far so good, drives well,,,has a couple blind spots that you have to get used to checking but overall an excellent car."
"10 28, 2010",My first Toyota SUV,"I am always on the go and live in the DFW area and the with the size of the gas tank, I have to fill up twice a week. The base model Rav I have only give me 300 miles w/ full gas tank. I wish it were at least 400. I got what I paid for. Good car for a family of 3, any more will be a tight squeeze. Very strong sturdy vehicle, the little engine is great. Has plenty of storage in the back!"
"10 12, 2010",Exceeded my expectations,"The RAV4 is quieter than I expected and the gas mileage is at least as good as the EPA estimate, if not a little better. I got the V6 which is very responsive. I like that you can lock in the 4 wheel drive at lower speeds. I only wish that it came with a compass since I did not get the navigation."
"10 12, 2010",Better than I expected,"It was a toss-up between the CR-V & RAV4, but after test driving and value-comparing the two vehicles, my new RAV4 Limited won hands down. Features that I love: 4-cyl provides great gas mileage but isn't puny when accelerating (CR-V doesn't have the gusto); stylish interior & exterior (mine is red with grey interior), heated seats, great cargo area (jogging stroller, pack n' play and tons of other baby gear fit with room to spare), XM Satellite, Bluetooth capability...and for all of us parents, the convertible car seat for my 16 month old daughter fits perfect (bench seat reclines to allow for a snug fit). This was a huge concern for me, and the CR-V didn't provide the same kind of fit - I would have had to place a rolled up towel or something similar underneath the car seat to get it to snap snuggly in place. The only drawback to the RAV4 is that the seats aren't conducive to long road trips - they get a little hard on the tushie after a while! I was on the fence given Toyota's reputation as of late, but I'm happy I took the chance - looking forward to driving my RAV4 for years to come."
"10  5, 2010",Love it!,"My husband and I moved to upstate NY and decided that we needed a four wheel drive car able to carry our golf clubs, fishing equipment and found antiques. Our only negative is gas milage. Our other car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla and we just gave our 2001 Hyundai Elantra to our daughter. Both of these vehicles get higher gas mileage. But in every other catagory, it is a 5+!"
"09 30, 2010",RAV4 is a solid car,"Just purchased but its first long distance drive proved it is what we wanted - comfortable, quiet, responsive and miserly on fuel."
"09 18, 2010",mary anns review of rav 4,I enjoy being higher up in the car it is the first time for us. We use to have an Avalon. I feel like I can see better. Very comfortable..............
"09 17, 2010",RAV4 2010 Sport V6 4WD,"Before I got my RAV4 in October 2009 I've test driven Acura RDX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Subaru Forester. In my opinion RAV4 V6 is just the best sport SUV for the money.

Pros: The acceleration is great. My black leather interior looks luxurious. The trunk space is big enough for my 2 mountain bikes :)

Cons: Would like to see sharper exterior design. Standard sound system is just ok. No Bluetooth connection.

Toyota Infamous Recall: I haven't had any issues with an acceleration pedal, but I had it replaced by a dealer just in case."
"09  6, 2010",Good car for the money.,"Got a great deal out of a three year lease. Car handles very well for a compact SUV, better than the 2005 Ford Escape I drove before. Ride can be harsh at times and highway wind and tire noise are noticeable. Overall fit and finish is good, material feels a bit cheap though. Honda and Mazda feels more luxurious. Gas mileage is decent for a 4x4 with four cylinder, I get around 25MPG on local roads. Overall I would recommend."
"08 22, 2010",Most noisy new car I have owned,"Bought new RAV4 LTD last week. When I went to pick up the car, it was noisy -- Sounds more like a Diesel engine"
"08 15, 2010",Great for the money,"I bought this car last November (2009) and I love it. It drives and handles really well so far. Unfortunately, it didn't really snow last winter so I was unable to try it on the snow. I have the base 4 cylinder model and was very satisfied with the standard features such as cruise control, keyless entry, Stability control. The interior is spacious both front and back, particularly the big trunk space. This car provides sufficient power and is very agile that it's so fun to drive. This car offers so much for the price. It definitely is a good investment for the money."
"07 11, 2010",RAV4 V6 4WD Limited,I got my RAV4 in October of 2009. If you live where it snows you must own this car! I live in Wisconsin and last winter we got 18 inches of snow one day - I was the only one who made it into the office that day. I don't know how I lived without the bluetooth or keyless entry before this car. I never have to take out my keys! The only gripes are the back door is sometimes awkward and heavy and the seats could be a touch more comfortable. But I would absolutely recommend this car - I love it! Toyota has made me a believer and I will probably buy Toyota from now on. The V6 is the way to go with the RAV4 - Honda is really missing out by not offering a V6 in their CRV. Also - there is LOTS of leg room in the backseat. The seats can be moved backward or forward. I LOVE THIS CAR!
"07  9, 2010",Ravtom,"A good value and trusted Toyota reliability. The purchase process was also painless, and started with cars.com."
"05  4, 2010",Bells and Whistles Gal,"I bought a NEW Toyota Rav4 2010 in March 2010. I bought it because I had driven a 1997 Rav4 for 10 years, sold it , and have been sorry ever since. I am so pleased. It is a V6 Limited with everything and I love each and every little gizmo. This car is ME. Thank you Toyota, the bells and whistles are a 10!"
"04 19, 2010",I wish you could try them out for a month,"I bought a limited which had many nice features. I was disappointed with the stereo. I am 5'8"" and it is even difficult for me to get the driver seat back far enough to be comfortable driving. It also feels like the seats angles toward the door which is uncomfortable for long periods of time since I commute. The ride is somewhat rough. Otherwise, it is quite roomy and appears to be well made except for the several new car rattles. The gas mileage could be better. It is fun to drive and looks nice. Love the heated seats and the cargo space. The back hatch would be better if it opened from the curbside and not the other which makes loading difficult if you are parked on the street."
"04 19, 2010",So far a nice car,I am pleased with the features on my RAV4 limited. It is not too big but it does have great back seat room.
"04 16, 2010",What a Car What A Deal,"Took ownership of a 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited in March and could not be happier. Go a head everyone and dish Toyota. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. The auto is great, I compaired it with a Subaru (I own now, big differance in quality) a crv (felt like a van). Has all the options plus I know it will last."
"04 15, 2010",Rav4 6cyl. LTD with Nav.,"This little SUV does the job but that is about it. Great power but the interior lacks certain details that should be expected for the top model.
The radio is horrific, not even good for a Yugo.

All over the interior you can see coast cutting efforts and yet the car is not so cheap. Leasing it is worth it. Maybe one of the best value lease out there.
For what I need it is fine, but I would have expected more."
"04  9, 2010",great combination of space and fuel economy,"I was sold on RAV4 during my test drive, when I made a almost 135 degree sharp right turn into a side road. Given its size, the handling was remarkable well. Feeling that even V4 gave me sufficient power, I saw no reason to get a V6. I have a long commute to work, 3/4 of it on the high way. I am truly amazed getting just over 30 MPG after two weeks driving. Granted, I am not a spirited driver and seems always get more than the window sticker number on MPG ( I get average 38 out of another car in the family, '10 Corolla in the last 7 month). I am nevertheless very pleased.

Its cargo space is surprisingly large and well laid out, although the interior materials somehow feels cheap with too much hard plastics - truly unfortunate drift by Toyota and now lagged behind Hyundai. The tires have a little bit too much road noise but so do the models from other brand. I initially thought the 4 speed auto made RAV4 look like a decade back comparing with its competitors in the class. But with the smooth ride and remarkable fuel economy, I no longer think it matters.

Recent safety recall no doubt made me think twice. But I have owned several Toyota, including a recalled '10 Corolla. I am not entirely sold by the headline story. All the negative publicity, however, did lead a great deal, including the 0% finance for 60 month. Dealer was also more willing to negotiate. Everything combined, Hyundai no longer has the price advantage and CRV became outright silly. So far, I have no regret with my purchase."
"04  1, 2010",Great Vehicle,"I recently purchased a brand new RAV4 because of the great deals Toyota was offering. I typically wouldnt be able to afford this vehicle but am very happy i was... I purchased the Base Model V6 with AWD and must say i couldnt be more impressed. The V6 has a ton of get up and go, and the options on the base model are hands down better than any other base model SUV. Only minor complaint would be that the seats could be more comfortable. LOVE IT SO FAR"
"03 24, 2010",I expect better from Toyota,"This is a very good car, but could have been great with a some more thoughtful user friendly design. No interior latch on the rear hatch is a bummer when sitting back there and changing into wet suit, bike pants, ski clothes etc. Also, when opening rear hatch, snow on roof falls INTO car. Similar problem on side doors. Center dash heater vents are hard to aim and you can't fully shut them off. Max roof weight of 200lbs is not enough for all my gear. Secondary glove box is hokey and poorly made. Automatic gear shifter drives me crazy. Very difficult to find gears when driving at night and clunky operation. The car is overly computerized. It's constantly beeping at me for some reason or another which is very distracting. Like what's up with the ""traction"" warning like I don't already know that I am sliding around on the snow and don't need to be distracted by warning bells and whistles. And every time I put a bag of groceries on the passenger seat, the no seat belt warning starts going off. Silly, but I guess that is modern cars."
"03 23, 2010",awesome rav4!!!,"I've been looking for a step up from my Toyota Solara for a while now. I settled on the Rav4 after test driving the Ford Edge (close second) and the Honda CR-V (disappointing). The Rav4 excells in comfort, styling, looks and fun! I had to wait to get my V6 in blue, but I love, love, love it!!!"
"03 16, 2010",Big improvement,"This is the 3rd Rav4 I have owned. It is a huge improvement over earlier years although at the time, I thought they were great. The new, bigger 4 cylinder engine handles the extra weight of the longer, wider Rav4 with ease. The extra cargo room is greatly appreciated by my dog and the ride is smooth. The traction and stability controls make winter driving a breeze."
"02 25, 2010",Still have faith in Toyota,"I purchased a 2010 Rav 4 Limited v6 in Nov. 2009. I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The Rav is small and sporty, yet gives me the room for 2 kids. Do your homework, and don't believe the media hype if you are a Toyota fan..."
"01 28, 2010",Great small SUV,"After much research looking at CRV, Subaru Outback & Forester, Chevy Equinox, etc, I settled on the RAV4.

I wanted good gas mileage, good in snow, room for a family of 5 plus the occasional 6 or 7th passenger & dependable. So far I think this fits the bill.

Mileage has been in upper 20's (~27) around town-we bought the 4 cylinder. It drives nice in our snowy NH winter w/good ground clearance/traction. We purchased the 3rd row seat & while small, fits our 2 boys (age 11 & 13), at least for short trips. It's too early to tell re:reliability but it has a good reputation & presumably this will hold up.

I wish the accelerator issue hadn't arisen. That adds new meaning to the Toyota slogan ""moving forward"". Toyota better get that cleared up or they will lose a lot of customers.

My only thought for improvement is I wish it was offered in a manual transmission &/or hybrid engine. Otherwise a great solid package."
"01 13, 2010",Great compact SUV,"This is my first SUV. I have owned this car for over two months now and I am very happy so far. I have the V6 4X4 limited model with NAV and leather seats.

Likes: Very quick and nimble with good ride quality. The back-up camera works well with the spare tire on the rear. The NAV system works well. You cannot input destinations while moving, but all Toyota's are like this. The bluetooth works well.

Dislikes: The driver seat position is OK, but the steering wheel blocks some of the warning lights. The glove box rattles a little."
"01  3, 2010",Very good value!,This is my first suv and I have only had it a month so I can't really compare it. But so far so good!
"01  1, 2010",Great Value - Fun to Drive - First Foreign Car,"Likes: Exterior sporty styling, INCLUDING the rear mounted spare with solid cover; roof cargo rack with rails; better than 26 MPG combined highway/city driving on new engine; interior room; large controls for climate system; center arm rest in back seat; airbags all around; telescoping/tilt steering wheel (a necessity for this vehicle); very responsive steering; 4-cylinder engine has enough power to merge into traffic and climb the hills; and vehicle FEELS solid and well-built when driving.

Dislikes: Seats are pretty firm and takes some getting used to after having a luxury van with leather seats; needs wind/rain deflectors on side windows, which I plan to add very soon. That's all so far.

Overall: I am very impressed with this vehicle, especially when you consider the price point, and Toyota's reputation for safety and resale value. For a Base model, FWD, 4-cylinder RAV, the new 2010 definitely delivers."
"12 19, 2009",One Great Compact Suv,"When I drove it (Base 4 cyl. 4 WD) the first time I loved how comfortably it drove. The handling is excellent...very smooth on the road. I thought the RAV4 controlled and dampened the bumps very well will little noise. Making turns was very easy. The power is more than adequate when starting from a stop position. I like the exterior for its new ruggedness and style, particularly the front grille. Although it was a base model and it had those steel wheels, the overall exterior is appealing and nice to look at. I also like the interior, though not as much as the exterior. Still, I found the HVAC controls very visible, assessible and easy to use. I think Toyota did a decent job with the type of materials on the dashboard. The seats are fairly comfortable. For what it's worth, I believe that the RAV4 does offer a variety of basic features such as air- conditioning, power doors, keyless entry, Brake assist... I bought the 2010 RAV4 last month and I've had so much driving pleasure. It's
a fun compact suv to drive."
"02  6, 2024",Hate steel wheels/plastic hubcaps! But dependable,"Love everything about my rav with the exception of steel wheels, plain drab interior and no electric or heated seats! Mileage could be better as well!"
"03  7, 2021",Toyota Rav 4 was and is still my dream vehicle,Love the car. The previous owner had it brand new for 1 years and maintained the car perfectly as if it was a member of his own family. it rides very smoothly and it has enough room for our musical equipment and  our guitars.
"01  1, 2021",Love the V6,This my second V6 Rav4. Why Toyota discontinued this engine in the Rav is a mystery to me. Love the power and dependability that this car has.
"11 16, 2020",Most Reliable Car I’ve ever had,This car is great interior wise and a very smooth ride to be a part of. I don’t care for the outside but being inside makes you forget what it looks like.
"11 12, 2020",It is very comfortable car,"This car is roomy, family-style car. Good for short and long distances. Only one concern that doesn't has screen and i cannot listen music, i want.  But i got a bunch of CD's . Lol. Overall RAV4 is comfortable, great value for its money and i recommend it. PS. Upgraded to 2020 and happier with music options"
"11  8, 2020",Great all around car,"Owned car since 34k currently has 400k and still going strong, usual brakes rotors pads maitnence. Weird grinding noise sometimes at 40-70km/h speeds. Had driveshaft knuckle replaced, no fix, replaced transmission, helped no fix. Apparently it's a unknown common problem with the model. 4 wheel drive works slick and never got into trouble I couldn't get out of, have done quite a bit of off roading, ride is stiff but tolerable"
"10  7, 2020",RAV4 are the BEST!,"Since my first RAV4 back in the day, I've only ever driven a RAV4.  It's the perfect vehicle for fun, comfort, road trips, beach car, garden car, sports gear, while still being a grown up and driving it to fancy events with pride.  Super reliable - this car (nor its predecessors) have been in the shop for anything besides scheduled maintenance.  The ONLY reason I'm transitioning from this car is because I have three young men with lots of buddies and we need at long last a larger vehicle.  I have driving this car as a single, safe driver since 2012 when I purchased it practically new with very few miles on it.  I've only put 8k miles per year, total of 80.862 at current odometer reading."
"09 14, 2020",Fast and fun to drive.Lots of room.,"My V6 limited is everything I ever wanted.It is fast.Lots power to tow with. Sicks to the road.Huge compartment under the back hatch.Rear seats fold down easily for hauling things.I was going to get a 4 runner.So fare I haven't found any I can't fit inside or tow behind.I have a hitch for a basket or to tow my 6x10 trailer with 2  4x4  4 wheeler's and all my camping supplies.I can't say enough about the power and how it grips the road.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs I have lots of leg room, head room ,The seat will go back even more for someone with longer legs."
"06 24, 2020",This car is exceptional. Great value,"Handles really well in snow, great cargo space, roof rack, extra storage. We took long trips and never feared. Back seats fold nicely - you can easily move a small apartment. Beautiful ride."
"05 14, 2020",Don't discount this small dealer.... Nice cars,"I was really pleased.  Looked up many cars in the price point, most were beat to death.  Drove to Kaysville, and this small shop was great.  We were very picky, and very happy with the purchase.  We even consigned our other car to this dealer, because they were NOT SHADY, but decent people.  Due diligence for all car purchases is necessary, but they passed with flyilng colors."
"03 14, 2020",This RAV4 is very clean perfect engine cold A/c,"Toyota 4cylinders Gas saver perfect suspension .
My price is one of the best on the market.  Very well maintained clean tires. 
Can take the best offer"
"03 13, 2020",EXCELLENT VEHICLE,The Rav4 is perfect vehicle for every situation. It's the last V6 you can find in a compact SUV and definitely has more power. I compared it to the Forester XT before buying but it wasn't even close. Very comfortable and gets around in the mud and off-road great.
"02 15, 2020",Very nice vehicle!,This vehicle was purchase for my granddaughter. She in College at Purdue University. 4 cylinder engine which is awesome on gas. She loves it and all for friends enjoy it too.
"01 29, 2020",I fell in love with the car as soon as i tested it,I love it! Absolutely one of the best cars I've ever own.  I've only had it for a few days but i cam tell it will last me for years with minimal issues
"01  6, 2020",This car  was a perfect car i ever have,This is a nice car drive smooth and clean inside outside no issue and nice interior design it sunroof backup camera the car is perfect condition
"12 18, 2019",Great car!!!,Starts right up. I have not had any problems with the car. Great condition on the inside and out. Lot more room then I thought it would have. Lots of storage areas as well. Will buy from Carvana again as well.
"12 16, 2019",Love our RAV4,"Comfortable and efficient. The only thing we don't like is that the back door does not have a lock on it. Toyota has not been willing to install a lock. When the battery died in a public parking lot, a maintenance person put a charger on reversed and fried the electrical system. We could not lock the rear hatch. Other than this one design flaw, we love the RAV4."
"12  5, 2019",best reliable car i owened,"IT HAS PLENTY OF LEG ROOMS,3rd row with extra seat( it can be fold). The 2010 Toyota RAV4 ranks near the top of the compact SUV class. It offers a comfortable interior, a pleasant ride, loads of cargo space, plus good safety and reliability ratings."
"11 21, 2019",Drove nice,Overall good riding car just wasn't for me. I was looking for more features then what this vehicle had it was a basic model. Had excellent milage for the year it was.
"11  4, 2019",Same oil leak over and over,I felt Rav had a great reputation so I bought one. I had problem after problem with it and wouldn't recommend. I kept having a seal go on it and leaking oil.  The ride wasn't that good. I owned it for about 4 years.
"10 27, 2019",It’s Toyota RAV4 speak its self,If all cars could let you down touts rav4 will never . Electronically mechanical it’s amazingly made so tough to cross over 200k on mileage yet they still strong and for sure they still hold their price value price that they are an amazing cars and well made
"10 18, 2019",Very satisfied with this car and plan to keep it.,This car is perfect for my needs. I primarily use it to drive to work and visiting family. I am very satisfied with the car's performance and value.
"08 26, 2019",Made all plastic paint pulling off makes nose like,I wished I never bought it's been nothing but trouble taken in for recall something about key intion horn never worked since paint pulling of
"07 25, 2019",Meets our Needs,"We specifically wanted a RAV4 with a V6 engine, which was discontinued in 2012. The engine has a lot of punch, which gives you confidence in passing and crossing mountain passes. This car also has ample cargo space and a roof rack that we will probably use to transport kayaks. We will be keeping this car in our vacation home in Idaho. We have owned several Toyotas over the years (including 2 other RAV4's) and love that they are so reliable and durable!"
"06 25, 2019",Everything you'd expect from a Toyota,"The Rav4 is a great little suv. Runs smooth and has great power with the v6. This is our 2nd Rav4 with the v6 and the first one ran just as strong and smooth at 140,000 as it did the day we bought it. Did a great job of keeping us going last year during a snow storm of  8"" to 10"" in northern Minnesota."
"04  2, 2019",Great car!,This is the high end model and I love it. Was in good condition. Had a flat but also had a full size spare in great comfy.
"04  1, 2019",Very satisfied so far.  Only drove it for one day.,So far it is just great.  You sent this to me too early in the purchase.  I would suggest you wait at least a week before sending out reviews.
"03 27, 2019",I've owned a Rav for 5 yrs ... still in love,"I bought my Rav in 2014, it had 97,000kms at the time. It's currently got 230,000kms and still going strong af. I love the styling of the Rav... it's functional as well as being pretty modern ...for it's age. I get an everage i  the summer of 9.4 l/100km and in the winter it's about 10.3(Tires totally a factor). I drive 25 mins each way to work on a highway, averaging 110 km/h. I'm lucky that I have the 2.5L Base, AWD ...it's basic but still rocks in the snow and ice. I've outfitted it with a set of 16"" Gislaved Nord Frost for the winter and have always run Toyo 17""in the summer. I use only synthetic oil now for high mileage vehicles and have treated her to a oxygen sensor clean each summer as well. Having a little suspension issue now but given the KMs and our absolute xxxxe roads in Nova Scotia, it's to be expected. I have 2 kids and the space inside is more than ample for 2 car seats and all our gear.  Paint and interior have held up AMAZINGLY well for what we put it through .. .. I even use it to haul wood for the woodstove, both towed with a trailer and loads in the cargo area when super snowy and the wheelbarrow won't do. Having the diff lock is one of the main reasons I bought the Rav over the CRV, Forester and all other competitors. I've been in a ton of situations where it's been a blessing. Remember, 4 low or diff lock isn't meant to get you in ... it's meant to get you out! Cheers!"
"03 26, 2019",It is the most reliable car I have owned,"It has never given me any issues, all the maintenance it needed was the regular synthetic oil change (my preference of oil) and filters but that's about it, I had never had to take it to the mechanic for any issues, all i had to do was change the battery but that's about it. Very reliable, it drives smoothly and very comfortable."

"03  3, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"Purchased this car new for my wife.  Has basically been bullet proof with very little need for mechanical repairs.  It's understandable why these cars routinely exceed 200,000 miles and more in their lifetime."
"02 11, 2019",My favorite vehicle I have ever had,My favorite vehicle I have ever had. I had an after market radio installed in the vehicle when I bought it and everyone is very impressed with the car and it is a comfortable ride.
"02  9, 2019",Great price for a reliable car with upgrades.,Meets all of the expectations of a Toyota. It is perfect for my needs. Sunroof and rear camera unexpected features. Great performance and value. The Toyota dealership told me I got a great deal.
"01 26, 2019",Good buy. A limited edition with very low miles!!,Sporty & luxury. Good back end space with rubber mat a must! Leg room comfortable & room for child's car seat  Has a nice v6 vroom to it!
"01  8, 2019",Love it!,I love this vehicle.  2nd RAV4 that I’ve owned and I’m really happy with it.  Handles well in poor weather which is frequent in MN. Great size as well.
"12  9, 2018",extremely reliabal v6 2wd handles like sports car,I bought car used with 20000 miles it now has 50000. I love it I am going to keep this car as long as possible
"11 30, 2018",Will NEVER buy a toyota again,"I bought a brand new 2010 RAV4, lovingly cared for and pampered this car.  However, even with great maintenace this car turned out to be a nightmare.  This car was recalled so many times, i just stacked the notices, then when i incured obvious rear end problems like leaking seals and slipping differential,  the dealer wanted $105. to inspect the recall, nice.  Then in 2018 noticed gas mileage decreasing and a strange noise and vibration, after investigating it at 130,000. miles found out the torque converter and lockup clutch was bad.  Decided to get rid of it before it got any worse.  When looking for a different car, many dealorships without even looking or drving my car for trade in, said they wouldnt touch my car with a 10 foot pole because of known transmission problems with that brand and car.  So got lucky one day and traded it in to a busy chevy dealorship that never drove the car and only received 8100 on a chevy truck.  Needless to say, I will never own or buy a toyota again!!!!!!"
"10 28, 2018","Extremely reliable, versatile midsize SUV","Bought new. 218,000 miles so far and no service issues. Comfortable. 23mpg. Enough space to be useful or hold 5 adults.  Quick but not powerful. Nice handling for an SUV. 
One negative - the 4WD is only engaged under 25mph."
"10 23, 2018",Awesome awd suv!,I absolutely love this rav 4 for getting around in the harsh winters and it gets great gas mileage for our traveling adventures. It also has a good amount of space in the back to pack things in!
"10 23, 2018","100,000 miles of reliability","We have 100,000 miles on our 4 wheel drive V6 RAV4. I really love this car. The only problem it has/had is that we noticed a small leak under the engine two years ago. My mechanic said it was the rear main engine seal, and would cost $3000 to fix. We decided we could live with a minor weeping seal, which was his recommendation. It stopped leaking not long after. All fluid levels are normal, so I consider it a non-issue. Now to the positives: You can sleep in the back, as long as you put a small board down to cover the 3 inch gap. When loaded up with 4 people including climbing and camping gear it will go 80 miles an hour uphill all day long. We drive from Seattle to LA every xmas and that thing is a little sports car. It's fantastic in the snow...though that may be due more to the 4 studded snow tires. The seats feel great, even though we have the simple ones. Inside of the car is plastic...but so what? It works. Nothing has broken in 8 years. It has the original starter, water pump, radiator, alternator, everything.  I've had to do brakes of course. We love Toyotas. I've got a 2004 tacoma with 240k on the original engine and clutch! And we have a 1991 Corolla that has 365,000 on the original engine and transmission. It's the unkillable car. I just put on the third radiator. 4th gear on the Corolla  doesn't work anymore, but 4th is over rated. We go straight to 5th."
"09 23, 2018",Never see a Toyota on the side of the road,This was my first car that I actually purchased it was very great to me and my kids very low maintenance required on it great on gas it was very dependable when I finally traded it in it had over a hundred and fifteen thousand miles but it was still running so great and I really didn't want to trade it in because I loved it
"08 12, 2018",Most reliable car in the planet.,"Overall, I just feel in love with this car. I really like the exterior style designed and safety features as described. It's an eye-catching car on the roads. Love it!!! :)"
"08  8, 2018",I love the V6 269HP Limited,"It will run..I mean top speed 135 maybe more.
And real quick 50 to 80mph in a flash.
Ill say more after i tow my 5x8 bike trailer this weekend. IM GOING To lift mine and add skid plates from front to back .Then keep it forever."
"07 25, 2018",This v6 limited Rav 4 will run .130MPH PLUSE,"Its all about the 269hpV6 for me..This Rav is the quickest thing i ever owned.It goes ftom 50 to 80 in seconds..Goes good in snow wet grass dirt and with the right tires even mud..My stero sounds really good its the JBL..It came with a sub in the rear hatch door.
I was going to add one but decided i didn't need it.
I added a hitch and can tow 3500lbs if i want to.
I found a 2 inch coil spring lift from Deaver im going to put on.It will give me 3 1/2 more inches of space between the finder n tire so i can go up 3 or 4 sizes if i want..Pluse they will make the rear spring extra heavy duty and add 500lbs of hauling n towing capacity. 
I live in WV.Lots of hills n mountains. Completely loaded i can go as fast as i want up any hill with more then enough power to pass anything in my way..
I cant say enough good things about my rav. 
I run it really hard up n down hills n mountains loaded going to my camp in the mountains getting over 20mpg..If someone else would drive it would get 25mph or more..Im so happy i picked my Rav 4 over a jeep wrangler."
"07 21, 2018",The best small family car,My wife and I love this car. We haven't had any issue after owning in for 4 years and putting on 90K miles. The only way we ever get rid of it is if our family outgrows it
"07 20, 2018",Very smooth drive,Spacios the trunk and seats good power stroke over hills very reability comforth to the passenger and kids very stabiler automobile good suspension make sure for stop good driving over freeway in city too
"06 22, 2018",Get the RAV4,"I got a used 2010 rav4 limited with 80k miles on it for $11,700 after talking them down & its a really comfortable and smooth ride.  Its a nice looking vehicle, got a lot of compliments on it. I love the look of it. Perfect size for an SUV.  Easy to pull in & out of tight parking, great turning radius. Cant beat the 4WD either.  4WD is way better than AWD and getting harder to find.  I test drove other suv's; dodge journey & ford edge since I have an 04' Xterra that was just totaled & i wouldnt settle until i found another 4WD & the rav4 outbeat them by far. Never thought i would like another suv as much as my Xterra. It actually gets up speed pulling out & going uphills way quicker than my xterra did & that was a 6cylinder so that was a surprise. Plenty of cargo space & it has another hidden cubby for even more space in the back and the back seats recline individually for passenger comfort which is pretty cool. It also has push buttons to put the back seats down for even more cargo space. Great on gas and it gets up and goes really quick for a 4cylinder.  Really roomy inside. Glad I went with the rav4 especially after reading thru 100's of reviews & reading all about the other engine & trans issues on other suv's until my eyes burned outta my head & test driving the other junk.  My neighbor tried buying it from me the day after i brought it home b/c he liked it so much. He ended up finding the exact same one in the same color and all for his wife with 60k miles on it so now we have matching cars...smh.  get the rav4 if you're having trouble deciding."
"06  9, 2018",Reliability and Comfort,I have had the Toyota Rav4 2010 for 5 years and never experienced any issues! Bought it used with very high milage and even so only regular maintenance and care is all it needs to continue for many more years. It has come in handy to carry furniture and large amounts of boxes/merchandise. Very spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly large leg room in the back seats. No complaints!
"06  1, 2018","Fuel efficient, Reliable SUV","We've owned this vehicle about 5yrs and its been a tank during this time, pretty much just the basic maintence, add gas and go. Even though its a fwd version, feels equally competent in the snow.

Even though its the base model, and is a few years old still looks stylish for its age and rides well."
"05 30, 2018",This Vehicle is CHERRY!,"Vehicle has all 3 controls ( Steering, Gas and break )on both left and right of car. Vehicle could be used for mail deliveries or driving instructor! Or car could be converted back to regular vehicle."
"05 29, 2018",Same like hinds,Small size engine. Beautiful looking and Drive sweet.  The price was also very great and I bought it at end of the month so the deal was supper. I am saving gas now
"05 28, 2018",Great Dependable Car,"We  love our Toyota Rav 4.It is super dependable, it has tons of room, and very stylish. Would not trade it for anything. best thing of all is every SUV out there looks the same except the Rav4"
"05 14, 2018",Awesome Handling,Met and surpassed my needs. It has  all the space I need for transporting kids and all the features I wanted also.A delight to drive.
"05  4, 2018",Perfect Car,"Love this car. It has been so reliable. No major mechanical problems just routine things like oil changes, brakes, and tires. The 4WD is great in the winter months. Plenty of room for me and my two sons. I love this car."
"04 26, 2018",Love Toyota!,"Though I just bought my Toyota Rav4 had to avoid highways back to work, but the construction was crazy! My Toyota handled like a pro, the roads were torn up and in some cases only dirt with holes to avoid, Escaped a Cement Truck that didn't have a spotter, and the general drivers strattling to get around you. Handled great, can't wait to take her on a road trip with weekend!!!"
"04  9, 2018",I am very happy with my car,I have no complaints with my car. I enjoy driving it. It gives a nice ride. Solid car and comfortable. It has always been dependable. Would buy another one.
"04  4, 2018",Great winter and Beach car!,"I bought it used in 2014 with only 19K miles, Limited Edition and fell in love.   More comfortable than my 1998 Subaru Forester on the road ( was a very reliable vehicle That I sold to my mechanic with @170K once repairs got expensive).  Color is Blizzard White Pearl  which is so  safe color for night driving but a pain to 
match  if  you want to fill in chips yourself.  Gas mileage average is 21 mpg but they are more efficient now and the ugly spare tire cover is gone which has to be hand washed due to nooks and crannies.   I like the trunk door that opens sideways vs over your head.  Only issue is city parking that doesn?t always allow to open it completely.   Suspension and visibility is excellent. Has a small 2? by 2? backup camera in the rear view mirror.  Radio and speakers are great with optional subscription to Sirius and 6 CD player.  Heated leather seats are an asset in the cold winter months.   Fits a lot of beach gear and other bulky items.    Steering wheel has Bluetooth and radio controls to reduce distractions!   Very good safety ratings."
"03 31, 2018",hard on gas very noisy,Always wanted one as time went by got to hate this rav4 rough ride bangs over bumps wind noise on the highway is terrible it is just poor ride quality won't buy another
"03 12, 2018",Toyota is basically another name for reliability.,"I am generally not a person that likes to own a vehicle identical to what everyone else has. Obviously there are so many Rav4's on the road that it was excellent to be able to purchase a limited edition model that you do not see a lot of on the road. Mine was the Rav4 Sport with the AWD, V6, and Sport Appearance Package. This package had to be custom ordered from the dealer because the sport appearance did not come with the V6 AWD. I had a Subaru WRX and when I moved to the Rav4 as a more family oriented SUV, a little bigger, I was happy I did not lose power. The 270hp engine is super punchy and makes this vehicle like no other. Never had a single problem with it after 8 years of ownership. No check engine lights, no sensor failures, no nothing. Just the best in reliability I have ever owned. Interior is comfy and back seats have great adjustability and fold down flat. Interior road/wind noise is on the average for the type of vehicle. Not a luxury vehicle in road noise performance, but way quieter than a WRX for example. Another plus is that it is built well and after 8 years does not even show a single rust spot on the body unique my previous Jeep that seemed to just react with water when wet. Excellent value and no complaints what so ever!"
"02 22, 2018",Gets me from A to B,"It being a used older vehicle it's hard to say what the previous owner has done to it. Right off the bat my exhaust was blown though. Then there is the whole 4WD thing... I've never once seen the 4WD or VSC light come on when I'm sure I could have used it. (in 30cm of snow) It's always felt as though it is in Front Wheel Drive, which is fine for my gas mileage but the traction of 4WD would be nice. I've heard sooo many raving reviews of the Toyota RAV4 for it's reliability. I hope that's what the future holds for us. For now it does the trick."
"02 20, 2018",Very reliable.,"Toyota reliability.  Gets good fuel economy, in town and on the hwy, despite having 4wd and the capabilities of a light duty SUV.  Works for me."
"02 12, 2018",Love this vehicle!,"The interior is comfortable and stylish.  I love the cargo space, especially that the second row seats fold down flat - sliding larger, heavier items in is so easy.  And I also love the hidden storage.  The one thing I don't like:  the spare tire cover is very difficult to remove.  But I haven't needed to remove it except when I bought new tires, and then the service man did it for me."
"02 12, 2018",Fantastic Car for the Exploring Family,"We bought this RAV4 new 8 years ago.  It has been a fantastic family car.  We've taken on numerous cross-country trip, up mountains and through forests.  It's never let us down and has keep us comfortable and happy.  

And all that enjoyment has been hassle free mechanically.  It's been well taken care of with oil changes and repeated alignments.

The only reason we are selling this car is because our children have left the nest.  We are down-sizing to a Leaf and would love for this car to find a family to keep it going on adventures."
"01 20, 2018",nice car .,"very economic. i had other car cars all this years , but this is the best car out of 8 cars cars in the last 32 years, very economic in gas ."
"01  9, 2018",An SUV that can get me anywhere I want to go.,I needed a SUV that could get in anyplace I wanted to go and in any type of weather.  Also I wanted leather heated seats.  This is the one for me.
"12 14, 2017",i love it,"After driving the Pilot, Ridgeline, Highlander, Santa Fe, and several others, the Sorento EX V6 was by far the best value for my money. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like a Lexus and it handles almost like a sedan. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! On my first 500+ mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. If you're looking for a new crossover in this segment, put this one on your short list to test drive."
"12 13, 2017",The roomiest compact SUV,"Despite not being the most Luxurious or powerful in the class it is incredibly useful vehicle.  It's trunk is huge, the folding seats are very easy to use, the cabin feels more like a large SUV with a lot of leg room on both rows. The AWD is working well and got me out from snow where many other SUVs got stuck (I guess it depends on tires as well though). In 7 years that I had this car I had 1 minor fix- very reliable."
"11 25, 2017","Solid mid size SUV,  always holds its resale valvu","Reliable , No random maintainence issues other than basics required . Limited editions are much nicer inside out."
"11 20, 2017",love this car!,I've owned this car for the past 4 years now and it has been my absolute favorite. Very reliable and a perfect family car.
"11 13, 2017",Dependable and Good on Gas Car I own now,I enjoy the power buttons and the leg room and the heated seats. I also like how you can set the radio stations just by doing them on the steering wheel. I also like how the spare tire is not in the trunk like other cars I have owned. It is great for those family members or friends who use walkers and they fit easily in the back in the car.
"10 12, 2017",A Rave for RAV4,"The best vehicle that I've ever owned.  Well-designed, comfortable, an outstanding performer.  The RAV4 is highly recommended."
"10  3, 2017",Most reliable and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is a great ride for a small SUV. It is larger than the current batch of newer ones and has tons of storage space. Is a very attractive vehicle with all the bells and whistles for this year of vehicle. Nice sporty style with additional options like the moon roof which is very easy to use, roof rails, exterior tire (which adds more space inside), cargo net and cargo cover. Has a very large cargo space compared to other small SUV's and has been a joy to own. I wish the newer Rav 4s had as much space as this one and the same high ground clearance."
"09 13, 2017",Excellent condition!!!,"Clean car, low mileage, priced much lower than the same cars available in the market.
already inspected. new tires. really clean condition car"
"09  5, 2017",Good car for a family,Solid car for a family. Great relaibilty. Good on off road surfaces. Overall great suv for a family.
"09  5, 2017","Durability, is the best description!","is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"08 29, 2017",Super Commuter Car!,"For my commute? Perfect. For a long trip I would prefer my minivan. My only, and ONLY real complaint with this car is the ding-dang cup-holders are tucked almost under the radio. A 20oz cup has issues and most refillable water bottles do not fit. That said, I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  It's been 7 years and aside from the routine stuff (oil, brake pads, wipers, battery) I've only had to replace a water pump.  That pretty much screams quality!"
"08  6, 2017",Incredibly practical. Great for all lifestyles.,"Practical car. Reliable, lots of space, decent on gas, good for all lifestyles. Love how the trunk opens up sideways."
"07  3, 2017",I love the style,"Nice small SUV that has enough cargo space for my needs.
It's really simple interiors design.
It's smooth ride also."
"06 22, 2017",So good I am sorry to have to sell it!,"Great comfy SUV. Dependable and fun to drive. 
Selling only because we need bigger people mover. Only negative is the back Up camera in this model is not great."
"06 19, 2017",great car,has lots of room for a smaller car handlers very well we love are's  good family car  rides smooth has a great sound system too
"05 29, 2017",Love this car,Only owned it a short time (used to have subaru forester) but love the way it handles nice quiet ride plenty of room inside. Would definitely recommend to car.
"05  7, 2017",Good family car,It's a very reliable car and worth the money. I have not had any problems with it even at 7 years of owning it.
"05  4, 2017",Best Small SUV I could find,"I like it. Aside from the issues I have had that were unique to the way the previous owner/dealership took care of it and repairs that were done, it's been great. It gets good gas mileage, and has plenty of room for me, my friends, and all of my adventure gear."
"04 11, 2017",Love my RAV4!!,"Fun to drive, ease of handling and reliability.  Been a loyal Toyota owner for over 20 years.  Will probably continue to be one for the next 20!!!"
"04  9, 2017",Good car for the price,"We purchased this vehicle for a good price, good shape, interior nice and runs pretty good so far as we have only had it for about 2 weeks but so far so good."
"04  5, 2017",Great Experience,One of the best experiences I have ever had at a dealership. I am looking forward to buying my truck from this dealership in the near future.
"04  2, 2017",Great car,"Great car, lots of power for small SUV. I recommend buying the V6 since you get the same mpg as the 4 cylinder. Nothing wrong with more power"
"03  6, 2017",Good choice for a used vehicle,"I purchased '10 Rav-4 a month ago, with 66k.
I'm very pleased so far this car.  It was a good purchase price from Center Subaru.  Time will tell"
"01  8, 2017",Great for what it is.,"Basic, reliable transportation.   Just bought it ... 51,000 miles.  Will find out.  The CD player seems temperamental.  There front window is noisy with a lot of whistling.  Otherwise, the car seems find.  I have also a Honda Accord which feels more solid.  Not so 'tinny' when I shut the door.  However, the RAV4 is just as comfortable."
"02 19, 2016",I've loved this car!,"I bought my RAV4 Limited in 2013 used with about 40k miles on it and it has 80,000 now. I'm currently in the market to trade up to a newer year 6-cylinder RAV4 with less mileage. The V6 is a lot of fun and unfortunately was discontinued for 2013. My gas mileage averaged 26 mpg in the summer and around 23 in the winter.

Driving is responsive and fun. The stereo in my car was upgraded to the 9-speaker JBL system which is GREAT. The bluetooth, satellite radio and phone systems are somewhat antiquated I felt compared to what you could get in other vehicles, but easy to learn and use and the sound quality was good.

4 wheel-drive performance was excellent - it has a button on the console to send drive power to all four wheels up to 25 mph to get you out of tough spots, and there is over 8 inches of ground clearance to take you somewhat off road if you need to be! In everyday driving, it's comfortable and reliable. Winter driving without 4x4 is also excellent.

There is also downhill assist and traction control - the downhill assist slows the engine WAY down when you're in the lowest gear so that you creep down hills slower than you ever could in first gear without braking constantly.

No problems at all with this car other than the recalls that have been stacking up!"
"09 22, 2015",Love my used 2010 Toyoto Rav4~,I was driving a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and I have RA and getting in and out really hurt my back. I can just turn around and sit in the seat of my Rav! I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage although it could be worse. I've only had it for a month and have taken in on a 1000 mile vaca and loved it even more. If I don't have any trouble out of it I will keep it till it literally falls apart. I love it so much I have to give her a name cause she is going to be so much a part of our family. car seat and booster seat for grandkids fit great and I feel safe with them in this vehicle.
"04 20, 2015",2010 RAV4,"Not a ""drivers"" car much like most Toyotas; rides like a boat with little road feed-back. Good brakes but you have to look outside to tell that they are working. Seat adjustments are for smaller folks - I am 5'11"" and have the seat ratcheted all the way back and I still feel cramped a bit (my wife loves it though). Great room in back with many space arrangement options, Dealer fixed a factory defect promptly with no hassle. Ride is floaty-rough; could use quieter tires that Michelins on now though they perform very well. Disappointed with 25 MPG (I get 29-31 with my Honda Accord). Upgrade sound is excellent and fault-free."
"06 17, 2014",Happy with my Toyota...,"My salesperson Jean Eddy Mores did an excellent job. I appreciate going out on the rain to check my Toyota :) He made sure our needs were met, he was very courtious and patient. I never leased a car before. This was so easy the sales person went with us all the way. Now he is a friend. Thank you for looking a masculine car for my husband...
Thank you"
"10  7, 2013",Great Ride and Comfort,Easy to maneuver; great rear view for backing up. More room inside than many of the co.mpetitors that are larger
"09 14, 2013",Very good SUV,"Great on gas, very spacious and good for long trips!. Mine came with third row seat which is awesome. So far no a single complain."
"08  2, 2013",Satisfied owner,"I have only driven this car a 1000 miles, but it starts when I put the key in. It was a good value. See me next year for a more informed review..."
"06 29, 2013",Wrong Car,"We ended up buying a 2012. I believe it was listed on cars.com by a Caddy dealer. I know it's buyer beware, but many of the prices for the RAV were way over for the time period and year we were looking for. Also, they tried to lure you to them with untrue promises. We were lucky and car runs fine."
"05 16, 2013",Wow what a great car,"We traded in a Corolla for the 2010 RAV4 and although we have only had it for a short time, we LOVE it. My husband rarely drove the Corolla but I can see he is going to be using the RAV alot. Being retired I was looking for a vehicle that would provide great comfort and thought the looks of the RAV were great. We got the limited and are very impressed so far with all the features. I am so happy I searched and found the car I have been wanting."
"05 10, 2013",Love my Toyota!,"I got great customer service and they really worked with me on the price. I had a budget to stay within and they worked with me to make that happen. I love owning a Toyota! It is very reliable to drive and looks good, which makes me look good!"
"03 22, 2013",Happy so far,Very happy with the vehicle so far. Had it less than a month so can't really comment on reallity so just gave a 4 star based on others reviews.
"03 12, 2013",Love the v6,Fourth RAV4 and so glad that I went for the v6 version w/ this one. I would not go back to a 4 cylinder. The problem is that for 2013 that's all you can get. I'd miss the power. This car has been super reliable and fun to drive. I can get anywhere (snow and mud) and enjoy the gas mileage.
"11 26, 2012",Great Great Vehicle-TOYOTA PLEASE FIX TRANS WHINE!,"The car is very nice inside and out. Ne never had any trouble with the car. Value is great. Quality is very good except for the nagging transimission whining noise from 20-50 MPH or so that has been on all ravs for about a decade. This at times leads to transmisio n failure, and most of the time it is no problem. Now there is a TSB on it with a mount fix that leads nowhere then a trans replacement that does the trick. Good luck convincing them to do anything without a lot of pressure. Getting back to the vehicle, it really is great though besides the noise. It is soo much more than you realize at first. The inside may appear plain but it is actually just nice and simple and de cluttered. LOTS of room and handles GREAT!! Acceleration is like a rocket. There are times where it does not down shift at low speeds like 25mph and is a shocker. Dealer said it is normal due to drive patterns and fuel economy needs. Glove box has a plastic shock that pops off the stub all the time so that you just leave it. The map lites are in the same area as the dome lite in front so when you push it you forget to turn it off thinking it is the dome lite. Then there is not a battery saver that shuts this off. Base steering wheel even is soo comfortable. It has really nice tapers on the spoke coroners. Runs great on 87, great MPG and Power. Tires tend to round or wear on the sides befor e the middle, it may be the tires or the stabilzer makes the car feel so square that when you take an off ramp you go fast and puts a lot of load on the edge of the tires. Love this car. Evey through the little things, no doubt a must have car!! Love it love it love it!!!"
"10 10, 2012",Near Perfect,"I have to say, I wish this car was built in Detroit. The exterior styling is a bit wonky but, like consumer reports said, it's a near perfect SUV. I have a 2010 limited with 3.5L V6 and have put 30k miles on it. The leather seats are comfortable, there's class leading room in the rear seat for two grandparents and car seat. The cargo room is like 37 sq ft with the seats up. That's 1/3 more than the Cayenne and GLK etc. It's plenty fast with almost like 275hp and not as heavy as other SUVs. It's got a backup camera IN THE REARVIEW mirror! I've tried to replace this SUV with something else 20 times due to the RAV being ubiquitous. Nothing comes close. All competing SUVs either cost way more, get way worse mileage, have less rear seat room, less cargo room, or are less reliable or all of the above. It's the pinnacle SUV right now, especially with gas prices at $5."
"09  2, 2012",Pleasant Surprise,"I'm previously owned a Celica (168K mi.), 2 Camrys (266K mi. and 173K mi.) and was looking into a change of Toyota product. Because of its good reviews, I decided on the 2010 Rav4 Limited, V6 FULLY loaded with almost 40K miles. For the last few months this vehicle has been a pleasant surprise...comfortable ride, quick, responsive acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6, looks great and plenty of room for cargo or our Labrador. Its only been a short time, but, so far...LOVE IT!"
"08  1, 2012",Nice Car,"I bought the 2010 Rav4 Sport. Ive owned it a little over a month and have put approx 3000 miles on it. There is no spare tire on this model unlike the Base Rav4 or Limited Rav4. It has run flat tires that seem loud in the interior when driving. To combat the loud tires I turn up the stereo (cd, am, fm & sat) and the stereo sound is not real good. There is an upgrade to this stereo I would recommend if your into music, find a model with the upgraded stereo. The vehicle also has a 4 cylinder motor, not bad for running around town or to work and back. I test drove the v6 and its like a rocket, it would be nice to have the get up and go when you step on the gas. The interior is well designed with easy access to all the controls. The gas millage is excellent compared to my last vehicle and Im averaging around 24 mpg. The drivers seat is average, mine is not power or leather and that makes a big difference in comfort. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV."
"06  5, 2012",Rav4 Rocks!,"This is my SECOND Rav4. The first one only being taken away (literally) due to it having been totalled out in a wreck. It was a 2007, had 145,000 miles and we still received an EXTREMELY fair check from the insurance company. It paid for a slightly newer, fancier Rav with only 20,000 miles. The insurance adjuster was even surprised at what a ""salvaged"" Rav 4 was worth. The car literally never gave me any trouble. I changed the oil rarely on time, which I don't recommend and quite often went thousands of miles over and yet that car kept driving. We only put new tires on the vehicle 4 times, new brakes after 125,000 miles on the FACTORY brakes and changed the oil in this vehicle. We did do the recommended dealer inspections/spark plug replacement, etc. but other than that, this car ran like a well tuned engine the entire life of the car. We were even laughing that even due to the high miles, we would not need a new one for another 2 years! The interior on our original Rav was base, a bit noisier than our Camry was, but overall, acceptable road noise. The interior of the cabin of both the 2007 and our current 2010 model are designed around the driver. The only complaint we have found so far is the cupholders in the front seat are so close to the drop of the dash board that when you remove a ""Super Size"" cup from the cupholder, it knocks up against the bottom of the dash and will often knock the lid off and spill the drink or crush the cup. As a consequence, you have to tilt the cup to get it out of the cup holder to avoid knocking the lid off, which will sometimes unseat the lid anyway! The interior of this model is a higher end vehicle and rides much quieter and more comfortable which is to be expected with the number of upgrades (from a Base model to a Limited model). The leg room seems to be a problem in the backseat for our 13 year old recently as he is now 5'11"" so I don't recommend this vehicle if you are toting leggy teens more than a few hours. It is comfortable though and the rear seats recline which aids in the leg room issue. The seat also adjusts forward/backward as does the front seat by a bar underneath the seat which is helpful when carrying items behind the rear seat. The amount of carry space when the rear seat is up or down is amazing. We compared it to the Highlander and it is a great deal more. I have YET to be loaded to the max in this vehicle and we use it for our business carrying boxes either flat or packed from one point to another. There are interior ""hidden"" compartments as well underneath the rear floorboard that we have stuffed blankets and stadium seats into in the past along with ice chests, etc. It is amazing how much space this vehicle really has for such a small car. The exterior of the vehicle leaves a little lacking to be desired in style, but performs magically. Our vehicles sit outside all day and all night, not covered and after a recent SOFTBALL sized hail event, my husband's Ford F150 was dinged up pretty badly, my Rav, not a dint,nor ding ,nor chip of paint missing. When we purchased our first model, we got the 4 cylinder engine which was sufficient even driving in Dallas traffic and the gas mileage was wonderful. The 2010 Rav has the more powerful 6cylinder WITH tow package included and it only misses the gas mileage by a mile or two, a wonderful trade off when considering the amount of power we get with the 6 cyl engine. The vehicle shifts smoothly even at top speed when an extra burst is required for changing lanes in traffic and will get away from you at a red light if you are a heavy gas foot/jack rabbit start at the green!
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a vehicle for carrying items/smaller SUV. We purchased it as a low gas mileage dependable vehicle for business errands as well as errands for family and it has NEVER let us down, NEVER left us stranded AND NEVER failed to outperform any vehicle I have ever owned from luxury car to luxury LARGE SUV!"
"03 30, 2012",Very nice driver,"Lots of room for a small suv, great on gas easy to get in and out of parking lots.
Very comfortable, smooth and quiet."
"01 24, 2012",Very reliable brand,"The 2010 RAV 4 4 cylinder Automatic all wheel drive is very quiet to drive and provides great elbow and leg room for a family of 4. The 4 cylinder has great fuel economy and excellent acceleration. 2010 Rav 4 has several built in creature comforts - multiple cup holders - some adjustable to accommodate larger cup sizes. Also contains built in features to plug in iPod or other music storage devices. I decided on the 2010 Rav because my family was getting cramped in the 1999 Rav - but we really loved the reliability of the brand and vehicle. Toyota has improved styling, features and space (head room and leg room) in newer model years. I still drive my 1999 which has over 130,000 miles and still runs great. I expect the 2010 Rav to have the same reliability especially with how Toyota backs their vehicles. I have owned Corolla, Camry, and Rav, and would buy or recommend buying to anyone who asks. A bonus is many Toyota's are being produced in the US, so I am helping to support the US workforce."
"12  2, 2011",not relieable,"This car only has one hole to put a key into in the whole car..the dealer only gave us one remote control key which is very unhandy and dangerous.
We should of gotten two keys but they would NOt give us two keys..we already had the car in the shop twice since we bought it in a three weeks time.
I would not buy another RAV 4"
"10 20, 2011",LIMITED is GOOD...some tweaks would be nice.,"Purchased a late model 2010 in June 2011 (first owner was Oct 2010), w. 500 miles. This is primarily wife's commuter and our long-trip car. We have added 4500 miles on it 3 months. It is a Limited V6 auto, all leather interior, rearview camera, etc.... I think the interior leaves a little to be desired in comparison to others. I'm sure a comparable model with the same mileage and age would have been cheaper and have a better ""looking"" interior. But those brands cannot compete with the reliability or the durability of Toyota engines, exteriors and interiors. We expect to hold onto this for 10+ years so we also got the 100k bumper to bumper 8 year warranty and Platinum dealer service package. The V6 is very responsive with plenty of pickup. It is driven every day (avg 12 miles) in town/some interstate and is garage kept. The gas mileage is around 22-25m/g and up to 27m/g on interstate long (2+ hour) trips. The interior controls take a little getting used to. I prefer the mirror controls on the driver door vs. the center console. We have keyless entry/push button start which actually is safer and makes you more aware of where your keys are and what you are doing?we love this feature. But, I would have put the push button start on the left side of steering wheel instead of so close to temperature/radio controls. I've cut off the radio instead of the car more than once. Back seat riders have commented on how much leg room they have and the comfort of the seats. I would have expected rear temperature controls in a Limited. The ride is a little noisier (road contact not wind) than I would have expected for a top-of-the-line RAV4. The steering wheel feels a bit tiny but appropriate for the vehicle. It handles very well in parking lots (turn radius) and at high speeds (changing lanes). There are a lot of these on the road, because they are reliable. There are better LOOKING models from other brands, but the durability of them, IME, is 5-7 years. After that the interior, engines and exterior starts to falter. Aside from the small things mentioned above, I would not hesitate to buy another one. I think it's the perfect car for a married couple with 1 (maybe 2) small kid(s). I think if you have a teen you'll need to get a slightly larger vehicle. It's a joy to drive and Toyota's customer service is top notch."
"07  8, 2011",No-frills utilitarian dependable transport,"I was moving across the country, and the Rav4 was perfect as it had the most cargo volume in its class (36 cubic feet with the backseats up, and 70 with them down - both are tops in the compact crossover SUV segment).

Since purchasing the vehicle 10 months ago, I've now put on almost 10,000 miles on it. My FWD 4 cylinder model is EPA rated for 22/28 mpg, and in my real world experience I find it hard to achieve city driving of 22 mpg on an entire tank. Perhaps more like 18 to 20 mpg. On my cross country road trip, though, I was able to many times break 30 mpg on highway trips. In fact, my best tank clocked in at 32.5 mpg - pretty good. So maybe my experience of mileage is around 19/30. One thing to note - the on board mileage calculator is probably a bit generous. My own fill up measurements usually register around 1 or 2 miles lower.

The interior of the Rav4 is very ergonomic - everything where it should be, and nothing distracts from the road. There are lots of little storage areas for phones, maps, paperwork, coins, pens, cameras, etc. However, I felt that the back seat headrests are a little firm and flat, while the front seats are very cushioned and much more comfortable. One good thing though is that the back seats recline - which is a feature not always able to be had on some other SUVs.

The Rav4 is very agile and has a great turning radius. The acceleration is very sensitive and responsive at low speeds, which means the car is very quick coming out of a light or stop sign. At highway speeds, passing power a little less as good, though still adequate. Going up hills requires the engine to rev a bit.

Visibility is excellent for the most part. I feel the A pillars are a bit big, and I have to pay attention to check the sides at intersections as pedestrians on the crosswalk may get hidden in them.

Overall, I thought my purchase was an excellent value. I would recommend to those looking for lots of interior room on a budget, who are willing to sacrifice a luxurious pampering interior for a more utilitarian ergonomic small SUV that is very practical, quick, and fuel efficient compared to other cars that can deliver similar cargo volume."
"05 25, 2011","Good Car, But,","If you get this car make sure you get one with the upgraded stereo sound system already in the vehicle. The base stereo sucks. Also, had to have at least 3 Nav units replaced on this car. I really can not blame Toyota for this. I took the car to Car Toys and it really was not a better place to go. I finally got the stereo fixed by a dealership aftermarket stereo place and since then have been very happy with this small SUV. It gets 31MPG at 70MPH on the freeway. Thats a very impressive MPG considering that this is the 3.5 motor. The only anoying thing on this car is that the climate system automatically defaults to recercerculating air when the temp is reduced to it's lowest setting. It's irritating to constantly have to take the car off recerculate especially on a hot day when you don't want to run the AC."
"05 23, 2011",Great Overall Value,"I have owned the SUV for 6 months now from new. Only had two items needing correction a loose rearview mirrow screw. And a window rubber seal got caught when I rolled it up. They where easily fixed by the dealer The car came with no charge maintanence for 2yrs and 0% interest for 5yrs. We bought the V-6 Sport model with 4 wheel drive with run flat tires. Between the sport suspension and the run flat tires it rides a little hard at times on a bumpy road. It came with no spare on the back of SUV door but I prefer the look to the mounted tire on the back. It looks great and handles like a sports car. The power is excellant 0-60 in 6.2 seconds. It feels like a large SUV but it is only 182 inches. The second seat has a lot of leg room as big as any large SUV. The back hatch that opens from the side is great if you have a low garage door. Love the relining back seat. Great 2 glove boxes for storage. Speaking of storage. The SUV has plenty of storage areas for your phone, CD's, garage door opener, even a hidden storage in the floor of the trunk. It has a lot of new features like hill assist. limited slip differential, traction control, stability control. The dash looks a little on the cheap side but what do you expect in this price range. Excellant gas mileage and runs on regular gas. All and all it is a well rounded SUV. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Previous stationwagons where BMW and Mercedes. Except for the interior of the RAV the RAV has all the creature comforts you would find in a Stationwagon costing twice the price. I test drove the new redesigned BMW X3 for 2011 and I would stack it up to the BMW any day for 1/2 the price. I can see why MotorTrend gave Toyota ""Small SUV of the Year Award"" for 2006. I have owned Toyota's in the past and the reliabilty is excellant compared to the two German cars we owned. And the repair cost when and if it breaks down won't cost you nearly as much as a German car to repair."
"04 21, 2011",Not for snow,"This was my first leased SUV and I was so excited to finally have an SUV that had 4wd ability as I live out in the country of ND. It handled well in good weather, but there are a issues I noticed in the 7 months I have had the vehicle, especially over the winter months - the road grip is poor when the roads are wet or icy, and in snow, the tires pack so much snow into the wheelwell and caps that you have to clean them out or your AWD/4WD and braking system lights come on and your car shakes all over the place, and if you live in a place where there is lots of snow, that rear window wiper is a constant annoyance. Whenever you turn it on, and there is a lot of snowfall, it will get stuck midway by packed snow and it won't turn itself off - normally leading to a trip back to the dealer to get it fixed. Both need to be re-engineered, along with the coffee cup holders which keep coming out, and the car's seats which are not the most comfortable to sit on."
"04  3, 2011",2010 RAV4...4x4 (base),"i've owned the 2010 RAV4 (base model ) for 3 months...
(CONS) driver's seat - wish it was more comfy.., tilt & telescope steering wheel could be better,Sound system poor placement & quality fair/ average, some blind spots when backing out of parking space,paint is Average/fair. interior could be lil' better...

(PROS.) Does drive good, excels good...I'm getting about 25 MPG's,that's HYW & City (4cyl.)that i like! Handles good.does drive nice, i had no problem with snow this year, never even used the 4x4.,plenty of trunk space, rear-leg room a PLUS.

... Road trip in May to disney world, will see if it passes the long ride?"
"03 28, 2011",Great vehicle for the money.,"Owned for eight months since I leased this vehicle in July 2010. Positive: decent handling and acceleration compare to other Toyota, Honda, and Ford SUVs. Gas mileage is decent, 25MPG average for 4 cylinder 4x4, 70% city driving. Good visibility inside out. Excellent lease deal, $185 a month 15K a year. Two years free maintenance. Negative: Rear seats uncomfortable. Road noise. Poor dealership service experience. No steering wheel mounted controls unless you choose top of the line models."
"03 24, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,Excellent preformance in drive the 4 wheel drive is also good slightly poor in milage 21.5 mpg and good reliability smoot drive
"03 14, 2011",Suprising,"At first when I heard my mom wanted to buy an SUV I thought two things... boring and slow. After she did a little comparison between the RAV4, CRV, and Forester there was one clear winner. The Rav4 was much faster, more comfortable, and provided the same fuel economy as the competitors. She bought a 2010 Rav4 V6 Limited and has never looked back.So far she is extremely happy with her purchase. I must say that after driving the car myself the car is shockingly quick and nimble for an SUV, at least the V6 version is anyway. Overall it is a great car, and I would encourage anyone considering an SUV to at least test drive one."
"03 11, 2011","smooth acc., poor road grip poor coffee cup holder","the limited 2 wd is a much smoother car to drive than sports version or 4 wd. somewhat negative is its poor road grip in turning and on wet road. also, its coffee cup holders are very poorly designed."
"12 23, 2010",WELL PLEASED!!!!,"I have had this SUV for three months and am well pleased, thus far. I like the visibility you have of being higher up than in a car. Not sure but I think there is a blind spot when backing up. I have particularly noticed it when backing from from parking spaces in parking lots. Hope it is as good as my 1999 SOLARA that i just sold with 175,000 miles on it. The SOLARA was a wonderful car and was still very good when I sold it."
"12  4, 2010",Exactly what suits my needs,"This vehicle meets my needs because:
It drives and stops well in snow.
It is comfortable on a long drive.
It gets reasonable gas milage (26.5 mpg avg for 1200 miles, from Calif. to Washington state.)
The design and arrangement of the seats, controls, and storage inside is well thought out and functional.
I frequently drive on Forest Service roads and sometimes with some snow. I have really appreciated the safety features that keep the vehicle tracking straight under power and when breaking. We think it is a safe, reliable and efficient package for use around town, long trips, and traveling on the back roads in the wilderness.
I have towed my small sailboat, had my bike rack on it and hauled mountaineering gear up to the trailhead on snowy roads. All worked well."
"11  4, 2010",First SUV,"So far so good, drives well,,,has a couple blind spots that you have to get used to checking but overall an excellent car."
"10 28, 2010",My first Toyota SUV,"I am always on the go and live in the DFW area and the with the size of the gas tank, I have to fill up twice a week. The base model Rav I have only give me 300 miles w/ full gas tank. I wish it were at least 400. I got what I paid for. Good car for a family of 3, any more will be a tight squeeze. Very strong sturdy vehicle, the little engine is great. Has plenty of storage in the back!"
"10 12, 2010",Exceeded my expectations,"The RAV4 is quieter than I expected and the gas mileage is at least as good as the EPA estimate, if not a little better. I got the V6 which is very responsive. I like that you can lock in the 4 wheel drive at lower speeds. I only wish that it came with a compass since I did not get the navigation."
"10 12, 2010",Better than I expected,"It was a toss-up between the CR-V & RAV4, but after test driving and value-comparing the two vehicles, my new RAV4 Limited won hands down. Features that I love: 4-cyl provides great gas mileage but isn't puny when accelerating (CR-V doesn't have the gusto); stylish interior & exterior (mine is red with grey interior), heated seats, great cargo area (jogging stroller, pack n' play and tons of other baby gear fit with room to spare), XM Satellite, Bluetooth capability...and for all of us parents, the convertible car seat for my 16 month old daughter fits perfect (bench seat reclines to allow for a snug fit). This was a huge concern for me, and the CR-V didn't provide the same kind of fit - I would have had to place a rolled up towel or something similar underneath the car seat to get it to snap snuggly in place. The only drawback to the RAV4 is that the seats aren't conducive to long road trips - they get a little hard on the tushie after a while! I was on the fence given Toyota's reputation as of late, but I'm happy I took the chance - looking forward to driving my RAV4 for years to come."
"10  5, 2010",Love it!,"My husband and I moved to upstate NY and decided that we needed a four wheel drive car able to carry our golf clubs, fishing equipment and found antiques. Our only negative is gas milage. Our other car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla and we just gave our 2001 Hyundai Elantra to our daughter. Both of these vehicles get higher gas mileage. But in every other catagory, it is a 5+!"
"09 30, 2010",RAV4 is a solid car,"Just purchased but its first long distance drive proved it is what we wanted - comfortable, quiet, responsive and miserly on fuel."
"09 18, 2010",mary anns review of rav 4,I enjoy being higher up in the car it is the first time for us. We use to have an Avalon. I feel like I can see better. Very comfortable..............
"09 17, 2010",RAV4 2010 Sport V6 4WD,"Before I got my RAV4 in October 2009 I've test driven Acura RDX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Subaru Forester. In my opinion RAV4 V6 is just the best sport SUV for the money.

Pros: The acceleration is great. My black leather interior looks luxurious. The trunk space is big enough for my 2 mountain bikes :)

Cons: Would like to see sharper exterior design. Standard sound system is just ok. No Bluetooth connection.

Toyota Infamous Recall: I haven't had any issues with an acceleration pedal, but I had it replaced by a dealer just in case."
"09  6, 2010",Good car for the money.,"Got a great deal out of a three year lease. Car handles very well for a compact SUV, better than the 2005 Ford Escape I drove before. Ride can be harsh at times and highway wind and tire noise are noticeable. Overall fit and finish is good, material feels a bit cheap though. Honda and Mazda feels more luxurious. Gas mileage is decent for a 4x4 with four cylinder, I get around 25MPG on local roads. Overall I would recommend."
"08 22, 2010",Most noisy new car I have owned,"Bought new RAV4 LTD last week. When I went to pick up the car, it was noisy -- Sounds more like a Diesel engine"
"08 15, 2010",Great for the money,"I bought this car last November (2009) and I love it. It drives and handles really well so far. Unfortunately, it didn't really snow last winter so I was unable to try it on the snow. I have the base 4 cylinder model and was very satisfied with the standard features such as cruise control, keyless entry, Stability control. The interior is spacious both front and back, particularly the big trunk space. This car provides sufficient power and is very agile that it's so fun to drive. This car offers so much for the price. It definitely is a good investment for the money."
"07 11, 2010",RAV4 V6 4WD Limited,I got my RAV4 in October of 2009. If you live where it snows you must own this car! I live in Wisconsin and last winter we got 18 inches of snow one day - I was the only one who made it into the office that day. I don't know how I lived without the bluetooth or keyless entry before this car. I never have to take out my keys! The only gripes are the back door is sometimes awkward and heavy and the seats could be a touch more comfortable. But I would absolutely recommend this car - I love it! Toyota has made me a believer and I will probably buy Toyota from now on. The V6 is the way to go with the RAV4 - Honda is really missing out by not offering a V6 in their CRV. Also - there is LOTS of leg room in the backseat. The seats can be moved backward or forward. I LOVE THIS CAR!
"07  9, 2010",Ravtom,"A good value and trusted Toyota reliability. The purchase process was also painless, and started with cars.com."
"05  4, 2010",Bells and Whistles Gal,"I bought a NEW Toyota Rav4 2010 in March 2010. I bought it because I had driven a 1997 Rav4 for 10 years, sold it , and have been sorry ever since. I am so pleased. It is a V6 Limited with everything and I love each and every little gizmo. This car is ME. Thank you Toyota, the bells and whistles are a 10!"
"04 19, 2010",I wish you could try them out for a month,"I bought a limited which had many nice features. I was disappointed with the stereo. I am 5'8"" and it is even difficult for me to get the driver seat back far enough to be comfortable driving. It also feels like the seats angles toward the door which is uncomfortable for long periods of time since I commute. The ride is somewhat rough. Otherwise, it is quite roomy and appears to be well made except for the several new car rattles. The gas mileage could be better. It is fun to drive and looks nice. Love the heated seats and the cargo space. The back hatch would be better if it opened from the curbside and not the other which makes loading difficult if you are parked on the street."
"04 19, 2010",So far a nice car,I am pleased with the features on my RAV4 limited. It is not too big but it does have great back seat room.
"04 16, 2010",What a Car What A Deal,"Took ownership of a 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited in March and could not be happier. Go a head everyone and dish Toyota. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. The auto is great, I compaired it with a Subaru (I own now, big differance in quality) a crv (felt like a van). Has all the options plus I know it will last."
"04 15, 2010",Rav4 6cyl. LTD with Nav.,"This little SUV does the job but that is about it. Great power but the interior lacks certain details that should be expected for the top model.
The radio is horrific, not even good for a Yugo.

All over the interior you can see coast cutting efforts and yet the car is not so cheap. Leasing it is worth it. Maybe one of the best value lease out there.
For what I need it is fine, but I would have expected more."
"04  9, 2010",great combination of space and fuel economy,"I was sold on RAV4 during my test drive, when I made a almost 135 degree sharp right turn into a side road. Given its size, the handling was remarkable well. Feeling that even V4 gave me sufficient power, I saw no reason to get a V6. I have a long commute to work, 3/4 of it on the high way. I am truly amazed getting just over 30 MPG after two weeks driving. Granted, I am not a spirited driver and seems always get more than the window sticker number on MPG ( I get average 38 out of another car in the family, '10 Corolla in the last 7 month). I am nevertheless very pleased.

Its cargo space is surprisingly large and well laid out, although the interior materials somehow feels cheap with too much hard plastics - truly unfortunate drift by Toyota and now lagged behind Hyundai. The tires have a little bit too much road noise but so do the models from other brand. I initially thought the 4 speed auto made RAV4 look like a decade back comparing with its competitors in the class. But with the smooth ride and remarkable fuel economy, I no longer think it matters.

Recent safety recall no doubt made me think twice. But I have owned several Toyota, including a recalled '10 Corolla. I am not entirely sold by the headline story. All the negative publicity, however, did lead a great deal, including the 0% finance for 60 month. Dealer was also more willing to negotiate. Everything combined, Hyundai no longer has the price advantage and CRV became outright silly. So far, I have no regret with my purchase."
"04  1, 2010",Great Vehicle,"I recently purchased a brand new RAV4 because of the great deals Toyota was offering. I typically wouldnt be able to afford this vehicle but am very happy i was... I purchased the Base Model V6 with AWD and must say i couldnt be more impressed. The V6 has a ton of get up and go, and the options on the base model are hands down better than any other base model SUV. Only minor complaint would be that the seats could be more comfortable. LOVE IT SO FAR"
"03 24, 2010",I expect better from Toyota,"This is a very good car, but could have been great with a some more thoughtful user friendly design. No interior latch on the rear hatch is a bummer when sitting back there and changing into wet suit, bike pants, ski clothes etc. Also, when opening rear hatch, snow on roof falls INTO car. Similar problem on side doors. Center dash heater vents are hard to aim and you can't fully shut them off. Max roof weight of 200lbs is not enough for all my gear. Secondary glove box is hokey and poorly made. Automatic gear shifter drives me crazy. Very difficult to find gears when driving at night and clunky operation. The car is overly computerized. It's constantly beeping at me for some reason or another which is very distracting. Like what's up with the ""traction"" warning like I don't already know that I am sliding around on the snow and don't need to be distracted by warning bells and whistles. And every time I put a bag of groceries on the passenger seat, the no seat belt warning starts going off. Silly, but I guess that is modern cars."
"03 23, 2010",awesome rav4!!!,"I've been looking for a step up from my Toyota Solara for a while now. I settled on the Rav4 after test driving the Ford Edge (close second) and the Honda CR-V (disappointing). The Rav4 excells in comfort, styling, looks and fun! I had to wait to get my V6 in blue, but I love, love, love it!!!"
"03 16, 2010",Big improvement,"This is the 3rd Rav4 I have owned. It is a huge improvement over earlier years although at the time, I thought they were great. The new, bigger 4 cylinder engine handles the extra weight of the longer, wider Rav4 with ease. The extra cargo room is greatly appreciated by my dog and the ride is smooth. The traction and stability controls make winter driving a breeze."
"02 25, 2010",Still have faith in Toyota,"I purchased a 2010 Rav 4 Limited v6 in Nov. 2009. I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The Rav is small and sporty, yet gives me the room for 2 kids. Do your homework, and don't believe the media hype if you are a Toyota fan..."
"01 28, 2010",Great small SUV,"After much research looking at CRV, Subaru Outback & Forester, Chevy Equinox, etc, I settled on the RAV4.

I wanted good gas mileage, good in snow, room for a family of 5 plus the occasional 6 or 7th passenger & dependable. So far I think this fits the bill.

Mileage has been in upper 20's (~27) around town-we bought the 4 cylinder. It drives nice in our snowy NH winter w/good ground clearance/traction. We purchased the 3rd row seat & while small, fits our 2 boys (age 11 & 13), at least for short trips. It's too early to tell re:reliability but it has a good reputation & presumably this will hold up.

I wish the accelerator issue hadn't arisen. That adds new meaning to the Toyota slogan ""moving forward"". Toyota better get that cleared up or they will lose a lot of customers.

My only thought for improvement is I wish it was offered in a manual transmission &/or hybrid engine. Otherwise a great solid package."
"01 13, 2010",Great compact SUV,"This is my first SUV. I have owned this car for over two months now and I am very happy so far. I have the V6 4X4 limited model with NAV and leather seats.

Likes: Very quick and nimble with good ride quality. The back-up camera works well with the spare tire on the rear. The NAV system works well. You cannot input destinations while moving, but all Toyota's are like this. The bluetooth works well.

Dislikes: The driver seat position is OK, but the steering wheel blocks some of the warning lights. The glove box rattles a little."
"01  3, 2010",Very good value!,This is my first suv and I have only had it a month so I can't really compare it. But so far so good!
"01  1, 2010",Great Value - Fun to Drive - First Foreign Car,"Likes: Exterior sporty styling, INCLUDING the rear mounted spare with solid cover; roof cargo rack with rails; better than 26 MPG combined highway/city driving on new engine; interior room; large controls for climate system; center arm rest in back seat; airbags all around; telescoping/tilt steering wheel (a necessity for this vehicle); very responsive steering; 4-cylinder engine has enough power to merge into traffic and climb the hills; and vehicle FEELS solid and well-built when driving.

Dislikes: Seats are pretty firm and takes some getting used to after having a luxury van with leather seats; needs wind/rain deflectors on side windows, which I plan to add very soon. That's all so far.

Overall: I am very impressed with this vehicle, especially when you consider the price point, and Toyota's reputation for safety and resale value. For a Base model, FWD, 4-cylinder RAV, the new 2010 definitely delivers."
"12 19, 2009",One Great Compact Suv,"When I drove it (Base 4 cyl. 4 WD) the first time I loved how comfortably it drove. The handling is excellent...very smooth on the road. I thought the RAV4 controlled and dampened the bumps very well will little noise. Making turns was very easy. The power is more than adequate when starting from a stop position. I like the exterior for its new ruggedness and style, particularly the front grille. Although it was a base model and it had those steel wheels, the overall exterior is appealing and nice to look at. I also like the interior, though not as much as the exterior. Still, I found the HVAC controls very visible, assessible and easy to use. I think Toyota did a decent job with the type of materials on the dashboard. The seats are fairly comfortable. For what it's worth, I believe that the RAV4 does offer a variety of basic features such as air- conditioning, power doors, keyless entry, Brake assist... I bought the 2010 RAV4 last month and I've had so much driving pleasure. It's
a fun compact suv to drive."
"02  6, 2024",Hate steel wheels/plastic hubcaps! But dependable,"Love everything about my rav with the exception of steel wheels, plain drab interior and no electric or heated seats! Mileage could be better as well!"
"03  7, 2021",Toyota Rav 4 was and is still my dream vehicle,Love the car. The previous owner had it brand new for 1 years and maintained the car perfectly as if it was a member of his own family. it rides very smoothly and it has enough room for our musical equipment and  our guitars.
"01  1, 2021",Love the V6,This my second V6 Rav4. Why Toyota discontinued this engine in the Rav is a mystery to me. Love the power and dependability that this car has.
"11 16, 2020",Most Reliable Car I’ve ever had,This car is great interior wise and a very smooth ride to be a part of. I don’t care for the outside but being inside makes you forget what it looks like.
"11 12, 2020",It is very comfortable car,"This car is roomy, family-style car. Good for short and long distances. Only one concern that doesn't has screen and i cannot listen music, i want.  But i got a bunch of CD's . Lol. Overall RAV4 is comfortable, great value for its money and i recommend it. PS. Upgraded to 2020 and happier with music options"
"11  8, 2020",Great all around car,"Owned car since 34k currently has 400k and still going strong, usual brakes rotors pads maitnence. Weird grinding noise sometimes at 40-70km/h speeds. Had driveshaft knuckle replaced, no fix, replaced transmission, helped no fix. Apparently it's a unknown common problem with the model. 4 wheel drive works slick and never got into trouble I couldn't get out of, have done quite a bit of off roading, ride is stiff but tolerable"
"10  7, 2020",RAV4 are the BEST!,"Since my first RAV4 back in the day, I've only ever driven a RAV4.  It's the perfect vehicle for fun, comfort, road trips, beach car, garden car, sports gear, while still being a grown up and driving it to fancy events with pride.  Super reliable - this car (nor its predecessors) have been in the shop for anything besides scheduled maintenance.  The ONLY reason I'm transitioning from this car is because I have three young men with lots of buddies and we need at long last a larger vehicle.  I have driving this car as a single, safe driver since 2012 when I purchased it practically new with very few miles on it.  I've only put 8k miles per year, total of 80.862 at current odometer reading."
"09 14, 2020",Fast and fun to drive.Lots of room.,"My V6 limited is everything I ever wanted.It is fast.Lots power to tow with. Sicks to the road.Huge compartment under the back hatch.Rear seats fold down easily for hauling things.I was going to get a 4 runner.So fare I haven't found any I can't fit inside or tow behind.I have a hitch for a basket or to tow my 6x10 trailer with 2  4x4  4 wheeler's and all my camping supplies.I can't say enough about the power and how it grips the road.I'm 6ft tall and 200lbs I have lots of leg room, head room ,The seat will go back even more for someone with longer legs."
"06 24, 2020",This car is exceptional. Great value,"Handles really well in snow, great cargo space, roof rack, extra storage. We took long trips and never feared. Back seats fold nicely - you can easily move a small apartment. Beautiful ride."
"05 14, 2020",Don't discount this small dealer.... Nice cars,"I was really pleased.  Looked up many cars in the price point, most were beat to death.  Drove to Kaysville, and this small shop was great.  We were very picky, and very happy with the purchase.  We even consigned our other car to this dealer, because they were NOT SHADY, but decent people.  Due diligence for all car purchases is necessary, but they passed with flyilng colors."
"03 14, 2020",This RAV4 is very clean perfect engine cold A/c,"Toyota 4cylinders Gas saver perfect suspension .
My price is one of the best on the market.  Very well maintained clean tires. 
Can take the best offer"
"03 13, 2020",EXCELLENT VEHICLE,The Rav4 is perfect vehicle for every situation. It's the last V6 you can find in a compact SUV and definitely has more power. I compared it to the Forester XT before buying but it wasn't even close. Very comfortable and gets around in the mud and off-road great.
"02 15, 2020",Very nice vehicle!,This vehicle was purchase for my granddaughter. She in College at Purdue University. 4 cylinder engine which is awesome on gas. She loves it and all for friends enjoy it too.
"01 29, 2020",I fell in love with the car as soon as i tested it,I love it! Absolutely one of the best cars I've ever own.  I've only had it for a few days but i cam tell it will last me for years with minimal issues
"01  6, 2020",This car  was a perfect car i ever have,This is a nice car drive smooth and clean inside outside no issue and nice interior design it sunroof backup camera the car is perfect condition
"12 18, 2019",Great car!!!,Starts right up. I have not had any problems with the car. Great condition on the inside and out. Lot more room then I thought it would have. Lots of storage areas as well. Will buy from Carvana again as well.
"12 16, 2019",Love our RAV4,"Comfortable and efficient. The only thing we don't like is that the back door does not have a lock on it. Toyota has not been willing to install a lock. When the battery died in a public parking lot, a maintenance person put a charger on reversed and fried the electrical system. We could not lock the rear hatch. Other than this one design flaw, we love the RAV4."
"12  5, 2019",best reliable car i owened,"IT HAS PLENTY OF LEG ROOMS,3rd row with extra seat( it can be fold). The 2010 Toyota RAV4 ranks near the top of the compact SUV class. It offers a comfortable interior, a pleasant ride, loads of cargo space, plus good safety and reliability ratings."
"11 21, 2019",Drove nice,Overall good riding car just wasn't for me. I was looking for more features then what this vehicle had it was a basic model. Had excellent milage for the year it was.
"11  4, 2019",Same oil leak over and over,I felt Rav had a great reputation so I bought one. I had problem after problem with it and wouldn't recommend. I kept having a seal go on it and leaking oil.  The ride wasn't that good. I owned it for about 4 years.
"10 27, 2019",It’s Toyota RAV4 speak its self,If all cars could let you down touts rav4 will never . Electronically mechanical it’s amazingly made so tough to cross over 200k on mileage yet they still strong and for sure they still hold their price value price that they are an amazing cars and well made
"10 18, 2019",Very satisfied with this car and plan to keep it.,This car is perfect for my needs. I primarily use it to drive to work and visiting family. I am very satisfied with the car's performance and value.
"08 26, 2019",Made all plastic paint pulling off makes nose like,I wished I never bought it's been nothing but trouble taken in for recall something about key intion horn never worked since paint pulling of
"07 25, 2019",Meets our Needs,"We specifically wanted a RAV4 with a V6 engine, which was discontinued in 2012. The engine has a lot of punch, which gives you confidence in passing and crossing mountain passes. This car also has ample cargo space and a roof rack that we will probably use to transport kayaks. We will be keeping this car in our vacation home in Idaho. We have owned several Toyotas over the years (including 2 other RAV4's) and love that they are so reliable and durable!"
"06 25, 2019",Everything you'd expect from a Toyota,"The Rav4 is a great little suv. Runs smooth and has great power with the v6. This is our 2nd Rav4 with the v6 and the first one ran just as strong and smooth at 140,000 as it did the day we bought it. Did a great job of keeping us going last year during a snow storm of  8"" to 10"" in northern Minnesota."
"04  2, 2019",Great car!,This is the high end model and I love it. Was in good condition. Had a flat but also had a full size spare in great comfy.
"04  1, 2019",Very satisfied so far.  Only drove it for one day.,So far it is just great.  You sent this to me too early in the purchase.  I would suggest you wait at least a week before sending out reviews.
"03 27, 2019",I've owned a Rav for 5 yrs ... still in love,"I bought my Rav in 2014, it had 97,000kms at the time. It's currently got 230,000kms and still going strong af. I love the styling of the Rav... it's functional as well as being pretty modern ...for it's age. I get an everage i  the summer of 9.4 l/100km and in the winter it's about 10.3(Tires totally a factor). I drive 25 mins each way to work on a highway, averaging 110 km/h. I'm lucky that I have the 2.5L Base, AWD ...it's basic but still rocks in the snow and ice. I've outfitted it with a set of 16"" Gislaved Nord Frost for the winter and have always run Toyo 17""in the summer. I use only synthetic oil now for high mileage vehicles and have treated her to a oxygen sensor clean each summer as well. Having a little suspension issue now but given the KMs and our absolute xxxxe roads in Nova Scotia, it's to be expected. I have 2 kids and the space inside is more than ample for 2 car seats and all our gear.  Paint and interior have held up AMAZINGLY well for what we put it through .. .. I even use it to haul wood for the woodstove, both towed with a trailer and loads in the cargo area when super snowy and the wheelbarrow won't do. Having the diff lock is one of the main reasons I bought the Rav over the CRV, Forester and all other competitors. I've been in a ton of situations where it's been a blessing. Remember, 4 low or diff lock isn't meant to get you in ... it's meant to get you out! Cheers!"
"03 26, 2019",It is the most reliable car I have owned,"It has never given me any issues, all the maintenance it needed was the regular synthetic oil change (my preference of oil) and filters but that's about it, I had never had to take it to the mechanic for any issues, all i had to do was change the battery but that's about it. Very reliable, it drives smoothly and very comfortable."

Superb power yet great fuel economy from optional V4; huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height; comfortable ride; responsive handling."
"03  3, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"Purchased this car new for my wife.  Has basically been bullet proof with very little need for mechanical repairs.  It's understandable why these cars routinely exceed 200,000 miles and more in their lifetime."
"02 11, 2019",My favorite vehicle I have ever had,My favorite vehicle I have ever had. I had an after market radio installed in the vehicle when I bought it and everyone is very impressed with the car and it is a comfortable ride.
"02  9, 2019",Great price for a reliable car with upgrades.,Meets all of the expectations of a Toyota. It is perfect for my needs. Sunroof and rear camera unexpected features. Great performance and value. The Toyota dealership told me I got a great deal.
"01 26, 2019",Good buy. A limited edition with very low miles!!,Sporty & luxury. Good back end space with rubber mat a must! Leg room comfortable & room for child's car seat  Has a nice v6 vroom to it!
"01  8, 2019",Love it!,I love this vehicle.  2nd RAV4 that I’ve owned and I’m really happy with it.  Handles well in poor weather which is frequent in MN. Great size as well.
"12  9, 2018",extremely reliabal v6 2wd handles like sports car,I bought car used with 20000 miles it now has 50000. I love it I am going to keep this car as long as possible
"11 30, 2018",Will NEVER buy a toyota again,"I bought a brand new 2010 RAV4, lovingly cared for and pampered this car.  However, even with great maintenace this car turned out to be a nightmare.  This car was recalled so many times, i just stacked the notices, then when i incured obvious rear end problems like leaking seals and slipping differential,  the dealer wanted $105. to inspect the recall, nice.  Then in 2018 noticed gas mileage decreasing and a strange noise and vibration, after investigating it at 130,000. miles found out the torque converter and lockup clutch was bad.  Decided to get rid of it before it got any worse.  When looking for a different car, many dealorships without even looking or drving my car for trade in, said they wouldnt touch my car with a 10 foot pole because of known transmission problems with that brand and car.  So got lucky one day and traded it in to a busy chevy dealorship that never drove the car and only received 8100 on a chevy truck.  Needless to say, I will never own or buy a toyota again!!!!!!"
"10 28, 2018","Extremely reliable, versatile midsize SUV","Bought new. 218,000 miles so far and no service issues. Comfortable. 23mpg. Enough space to be useful or hold 5 adults.  Quick but not powerful. Nice handling for an SUV. 
One negative - the 4WD is only engaged under 25mph."
"10 23, 2018",Awesome awd suv!,I absolutely love this rav 4 for getting around in the harsh winters and it gets great gas mileage for our traveling adventures. It also has a good amount of space in the back to pack things in!
"10 23, 2018","100,000 miles of reliability","We have 100,000 miles on our 4 wheel drive V6 RAV4. I really love this car. The only problem it has/had is that we noticed a small leak under the engine two years ago. My mechanic said it was the rear main engine seal, and would cost $3000 to fix. We decided we could live with a minor weeping seal, which was his recommendation. It stopped leaking not long after. All fluid levels are normal, so I consider it a non-issue. Now to the positives: You can sleep in the back, as long as you put a small board down to cover the 3 inch gap. When loaded up with 4 people including climbing and camping gear it will go 80 miles an hour uphill all day long. We drive from Seattle to LA every xmas and that thing is a little sports car. It's fantastic in the snow...though that may be due more to the 4 studded snow tires. The seats feel great, even though we have the simple ones. Inside of the car is plastic...but so what? It works. Nothing has broken in 8 years. It has the original starter, water pump, radiator, alternator, everything.  I've had to do brakes of course. We love Toyotas. I've got a 2004 tacoma with 240k on the original engine and clutch! And we have a 1991 Corolla that has 365,000 on the original engine and transmission. It's the unkillable car. I just put on the third radiator. 4th gear on the Corolla  doesn't work anymore, but 4th is over rated. We go straight to 5th."
"09 23, 2018",Never see a Toyota on the side of the road,This was my first car that I actually purchased it was very great to me and my kids very low maintenance required on it great on gas it was very dependable when I finally traded it in it had over a hundred and fifteen thousand miles but it was still running so great and I really didn't want to trade it in because I loved it
"08 12, 2018",Most reliable car in the planet.,"Overall, I just feel in love with this car. I really like the exterior style designed and safety features as described. It's an eye-catching car on the roads. Love it!!! :)"
"08  8, 2018",I love the V6 269HP Limited,"It will run..I mean top speed 135 maybe more.
And real quick 50 to 80mph in a flash.
Ill say more after i tow my 5x8 bike trailer this weekend. IM GOING To lift mine and add skid plates from front to back .Then keep it forever."
"07 25, 2018",This v6 limited Rav 4 will run .130MPH PLUSE,"Its all about the 269hpV6 for me..This Rav is the quickest thing i ever owned.It goes ftom 50 to 80 in seconds..Goes good in snow wet grass dirt and with the right tires even mud..My stero sounds really good its the JBL..It came with a sub in the rear hatch door.
I was going to add one but decided i didn't need it.
I added a hitch and can tow 3500lbs if i want to.
I found a 2 inch coil spring lift from Deaver im going to put on.It will give me 3 1/2 more inches of space between the finder n tire so i can go up 3 or 4 sizes if i want..Pluse they will make the rear spring extra heavy duty and add 500lbs of hauling n towing capacity. 
I live in WV.Lots of hills n mountains. Completely loaded i can go as fast as i want up any hill with more then enough power to pass anything in my way..
I cant say enough good things about my rav. 
I run it really hard up n down hills n mountains loaded going to my camp in the mountains getting over 20mpg..If someone else would drive it would get 25mph or more..Im so happy i picked my Rav 4 over a jeep wrangler."
"07 21, 2018",The best small family car,My wife and I love this car. We haven't had any issue after owning in for 4 years and putting on 90K miles. The only way we ever get rid of it is if our family outgrows it
"07 20, 2018",Very smooth drive,Spacios the trunk and seats good power stroke over hills very reability comforth to the passenger and kids very stabiler automobile good suspension make sure for stop good driving over freeway in city too
"06 22, 2018",Get the RAV4,"I got a used 2010 rav4 limited with 80k miles on it for $11,700 after talking them down & its a really comfortable and smooth ride.  Its a nice looking vehicle, got a lot of compliments on it. I love the look of it. Perfect size for an SUV.  Easy to pull in & out of tight parking, great turning radius. Cant beat the 4WD either.  4WD is way better than AWD and getting harder to find.  I test drove other suv's; dodge journey & ford edge since I have an 04' Xterra that was just totaled & i wouldnt settle until i found another 4WD & the rav4 outbeat them by far. Never thought i would like another suv as much as my Xterra. It actually gets up speed pulling out & going uphills way quicker than my xterra did & that was a 6cylinder so that was a surprise. Plenty of cargo space & it has another hidden cubby for even more space in the back and the back seats recline individually for passenger comfort which is pretty cool. It also has push buttons to put the back seats down for even more cargo space. Great on gas and it gets up and goes really quick for a 4cylinder.  Really roomy inside. Glad I went with the rav4 especially after reading thru 100's of reviews & reading all about the other engine & trans issues on other suv's until my eyes burned outta my head & test driving the other junk.  My neighbor tried buying it from me the day after i brought it home b/c he liked it so much. He ended up finding the exact same one in the same color and all for his wife with 60k miles on it so now we have matching cars...smh.  get the rav4 if you're having trouble deciding."
"06  9, 2018",Reliability and Comfort,I have had the Toyota Rav4 2010 for 5 years and never experienced any issues! Bought it used with very high milage and even so only regular maintenance and care is all it needs to continue for many more years. It has come in handy to carry furniture and large amounts of boxes/merchandise. Very spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly large leg room in the back seats. No complaints!
"06  1, 2018","Fuel efficient, Reliable SUV","We've owned this vehicle about 5yrs and its been a tank during this time, pretty much just the basic maintence, add gas and go. Even though its a fwd version, feels equally competent in the snow.

Even though its the base model, and is a few years old still looks stylish for its age and rides well."
"05 30, 2018",This Vehicle is CHERRY!,"Vehicle has all 3 controls ( Steering, Gas and break )on both left and right of car. Vehicle could be used for mail deliveries or driving instructor! Or car could be converted back to regular vehicle."
"05 29, 2018",Same like hinds,Small size engine. Beautiful looking and Drive sweet.  The price was also very great and I bought it at end of the month so the deal was supper. I am saving gas now
"05 28, 2018",Great Dependable Car,"We  love our Toyota Rav 4.It is super dependable, it has tons of room, and very stylish. Would not trade it for anything. best thing of all is every SUV out there looks the same except the Rav4"
"05 14, 2018",Awesome Handling,Met and surpassed my needs. It has  all the space I need for transporting kids and all the features I wanted also.A delight to drive.
"05  4, 2018",Perfect Car,"Love this car. It has been so reliable. No major mechanical problems just routine things like oil changes, brakes, and tires. The 4WD is great in the winter months. Plenty of room for me and my two sons. I love this car."
"04 26, 2018",Love Toyota!,"Though I just bought my Toyota Rav4 had to avoid highways back to work, but the construction was crazy! My Toyota handled like a pro, the roads were torn up and in some cases only dirt with holes to avoid, Escaped a Cement Truck that didn't have a spotter, and the general drivers strattling to get around you. Handled great, can't wait to take her on a road trip with weekend!!!"
"04  9, 2018",I am very happy with my car,I have no complaints with my car. I enjoy driving it. It gives a nice ride. Solid car and comfortable. It has always been dependable. Would buy another one.
"04  4, 2018",Great winter and Beach car!,"I bought it used in 2014 with only 19K miles, Limited Edition and fell in love.   More comfortable than my 1998 Subaru Forester on the road ( was a very reliable vehicle That I sold to my mechanic with @170K once repairs got expensive).  Color is Blizzard White Pearl  which is so  safe color for night driving but a pain to 
match  if  you want to fill in chips yourself.  Gas mileage average is 21 mpg but they are more efficient now and the ugly spare tire cover is gone which has to be hand washed due to nooks and crannies.   I like the trunk door that opens sideways vs over your head.  Only issue is city parking that doesn?t always allow to open it completely.   Suspension and visibility is excellent. Has a small 2? by 2? backup camera in the rear view mirror.  Radio and speakers are great with optional subscription to Sirius and 6 CD player.  Heated leather seats are an asset in the cold winter months.   Fits a lot of beach gear and other bulky items.    Steering wheel has Bluetooth and radio controls to reduce distractions!   Very good safety ratings."
"03 31, 2018",hard on gas very noisy,Always wanted one as time went by got to hate this rav4 rough ride bangs over bumps wind noise on the highway is terrible it is just poor ride quality won't buy another
"03 12, 2018",Toyota is basically another name for reliability.,"I am generally not a person that likes to own a vehicle identical to what everyone else has. Obviously there are so many Rav4's on the road that it was excellent to be able to purchase a limited edition model that you do not see a lot of on the road. Mine was the Rav4 Sport with the AWD, V6, and Sport Appearance Package. This package had to be custom ordered from the dealer because the sport appearance did not come with the V6 AWD. I had a Subaru WRX and when I moved to the Rav4 as a more family oriented SUV, a little bigger, I was happy I did not lose power. The 270hp engine is super punchy and makes this vehicle like no other. Never had a single problem with it after 8 years of ownership. No check engine lights, no sensor failures, no nothing. Just the best in reliability I have ever owned. Interior is comfy and back seats have great adjustability and fold down flat. Interior road/wind noise is on the average for the type of vehicle. Not a luxury vehicle in road noise performance, but way quieter than a WRX for example. Another plus is that it is built well and after 8 years does not even show a single rust spot on the body unique my previous Jeep that seemed to just react with water when wet. Excellent value and no complaints what so ever!"
"02 22, 2018",Gets me from A to B,"It being a used older vehicle it's hard to say what the previous owner has done to it. Right off the bat my exhaust was blown though. Then there is the whole 4WD thing... I've never once seen the 4WD or VSC light come on when I'm sure I could have used it. (in 30cm of snow) It's always felt as though it is in Front Wheel Drive, which is fine for my gas mileage but the traction of 4WD would be nice. I've heard sooo many raving reviews of the Toyota RAV4 for it's reliability. I hope that's what the future holds for us. For now it does the trick."
"02 20, 2018",Very reliable.,"Toyota reliability.  Gets good fuel economy, in town and on the hwy, despite having 4wd and the capabilities of a light duty SUV.  Works for me."
"02 12, 2018",Love this vehicle!,"The interior is comfortable and stylish.  I love the cargo space, especially that the second row seats fold down flat - sliding larger, heavier items in is so easy.  And I also love the hidden storage.  The one thing I don't like:  the spare tire cover is very difficult to remove.  But I haven't needed to remove it except when I bought new tires, and then the service man did it for me."
"02 12, 2018",Fantastic Car for the Exploring Family,"We bought this RAV4 new 8 years ago.  It has been a fantastic family car.  We've taken on numerous cross-country trip, up mountains and through forests.  It's never let us down and has keep us comfortable and happy.  

And all that enjoyment has been hassle free mechanically.  It's been well taken care of with oil changes and repeated alignments.

The only reason we are selling this car is because our children have left the nest.  We are down-sizing to a Leaf and would love for this car to find a family to keep it going on adventures."
"01 20, 2018",nice car .,"very economic. i had other car cars all this years , but this is the best car out of 8 cars cars in the last 32 years, very economic in gas ."
"01  9, 2018",An SUV that can get me anywhere I want to go.,I needed a SUV that could get in anyplace I wanted to go and in any type of weather.  Also I wanted leather heated seats.  This is the one for me.
"12 14, 2017",i love it,"After driving the Pilot, Ridgeline, Highlander, Santa Fe, and several others, the Sorento EX V6 was by far the best value for my money. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like a Lexus and it handles almost like a sedan. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! On my first 500+ mile trip, I averaged 28.8 mpg. If you're looking for a new crossover in this segment, put this one on your short list to test drive."
"12 13, 2017",The roomiest compact SUV,"Despite not being the most Luxurious or powerful in the class it is incredibly useful vehicle.  It's trunk is huge, the folding seats are very easy to use, the cabin feels more like a large SUV with a lot of leg room on both rows. The AWD is working well and got me out from snow where many other SUVs got stuck (I guess it depends on tires as well though). In 7 years that I had this car I had 1 minor fix- very reliable."
"11 25, 2017","Solid mid size SUV,  always holds its resale valvu","Reliable , No random maintainence issues other than basics required . Limited editions are much nicer inside out."
"11 20, 2017",love this car!,I've owned this car for the past 4 years now and it has been my absolute favorite. Very reliable and a perfect family car.
"11 13, 2017",Dependable and Good on Gas Car I own now,I enjoy the power buttons and the leg room and the heated seats. I also like how you can set the radio stations just by doing them on the steering wheel. I also like how the spare tire is not in the trunk like other cars I have owned. It is great for those family members or friends who use walkers and they fit easily in the back in the car.
"10 12, 2017",A Rave for RAV4,"The best vehicle that I've ever owned.  Well-designed, comfortable, an outstanding performer.  The RAV4 is highly recommended."
"10  3, 2017",Most reliable and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is a great ride for a small SUV. It is larger than the current batch of newer ones and has tons of storage space. Is a very attractive vehicle with all the bells and whistles for this year of vehicle. Nice sporty style with additional options like the moon roof which is very easy to use, roof rails, exterior tire (which adds more space inside), cargo net and cargo cover. Has a very large cargo space compared to other small SUV's and has been a joy to own. I wish the newer Rav 4s had as much space as this one and the same high ground clearance."
"09 13, 2017",Excellent condition!!!,"Clean car, low mileage, priced much lower than the same cars available in the market.
already inspected. new tires. really clean condition car"
"09  5, 2017",Good car for a family,Solid car for a family. Great relaibilty. Good on off road surfaces. Overall great suv for a family.
"09  5, 2017","Durability, is the best description!","is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"08 29, 2017",Super Commuter Car!,"For my commute? Perfect. For a long trip I would prefer my minivan. My only, and ONLY real complaint with this car is the ding-dang cup-holders are tucked almost under the radio. A 20oz cup has issues and most refillable water bottles do not fit. That said, I would buy this car again in a heartbeat.  It's been 7 years and aside from the routine stuff (oil, brake pads, wipers, battery) I've only had to replace a water pump.  That pretty much screams quality!"
"08  6, 2017",Incredibly practical. Great for all lifestyles.,"Practical car. Reliable, lots of space, decent on gas, good for all lifestyles. Love how the trunk opens up sideways."
"07  3, 2017",I love the style,"Nice small SUV that has enough cargo space for my needs.
It's really simple interiors design.
It's smooth ride also."
"06 22, 2017",So good I am sorry to have to sell it!,"Great comfy SUV. Dependable and fun to drive. 
Selling only because we need bigger people mover. Only negative is the back Up camera in this model is not great."
"06 19, 2017",great car,has lots of room for a smaller car handlers very well we love are's  good family car  rides smooth has a great sound system too
"05 29, 2017",Love this car,Only owned it a short time (used to have subaru forester) but love the way it handles nice quiet ride plenty of room inside. Would definitely recommend to car.
"05  7, 2017",Good family car,It's a very reliable car and worth the money. I have not had any problems with it even at 7 years of owning it.
"05  4, 2017",Best Small SUV I could find,"I like it. Aside from the issues I have had that were unique to the way the previous owner/dealership took care of it and repairs that were done, it's been great. It gets good gas mileage, and has plenty of room for me, my friends, and all of my adventure gear."
"04 11, 2017",Love my RAV4!!,"Fun to drive, ease of handling and reliability.  Been a loyal Toyota owner for over 20 years.  Will probably continue to be one for the next 20!!!"
"04  9, 2017",Good car for the price,"We purchased this vehicle for a good price, good shape, interior nice and runs pretty good so far as we have only had it for about 2 weeks but so far so good."
"04  5, 2017",Great Experience,One of the best experiences I have ever had at a dealership. I am looking forward to buying my truck from this dealership in the near future.
"04  2, 2017",Great car,"Great car, lots of power for small SUV. I recommend buying the V6 since you get the same mpg as the 4 cylinder. Nothing wrong with more power"
"03  6, 2017",Good choice for a used vehicle,"I purchased '10 Rav-4 a month ago, with 66k.
I'm very pleased so far this car.  It was a good purchase price from Center Subaru.  Time will tell"
"01  8, 2017",Great for what it is.,"Basic, reliable transportation.   Just bought it ... 51,000 miles.  Will find out.  The CD player seems temperamental.  There front window is noisy with a lot of whistling.  Otherwise, the car seems find.  I have also a Honda Accord which feels more solid.  Not so 'tinny' when I shut the door.  However, the RAV4 is just as comfortable."
"02 19, 2016",I've loved this car!,"I bought my RAV4 Limited in 2013 used with about 40k miles on it and it has 80,000 now. I'm currently in the market to trade up to a newer year 6-cylinder RAV4 with less mileage. The V6 is a lot of fun and unfortunately was discontinued for 2013. My gas mileage averaged 26 mpg in the summer and around 23 in the winter.

Driving is responsive and fun. The stereo in my car was upgraded to the 9-speaker JBL system which is GREAT. The bluetooth, satellite radio and phone systems are somewhat antiquated I felt compared to what you could get in other vehicles, but easy to learn and use and the sound quality was good.

4 wheel-drive performance was excellent - it has a button on the console to send drive power to all four wheels up to 25 mph to get you out of tough spots, and there is over 8 inches of ground clearance to take you somewhat off road if you need to be! In everyday driving, it's comfortable and reliable. Winter driving without 4x4 is also excellent.

There is also downhill assist and traction control - the downhill assist slows the engine WAY down when you're in the lowest gear so that you creep down hills slower than you ever could in first gear without braking constantly.

No problems at all with this car other than the recalls that have been stacking up!"
"09 22, 2015",Love my used 2010 Toyoto Rav4~,I was driving a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and I have RA and getting in and out really hurt my back. I can just turn around and sit in the seat of my Rav! I am a little disappointed in the gas mileage although it could be worse. I've only had it for a month and have taken in on a 1000 mile vaca and loved it even more. If I don't have any trouble out of it I will keep it till it literally falls apart. I love it so much I have to give her a name cause she is going to be so much a part of our family. car seat and booster seat for grandkids fit great and I feel safe with them in this vehicle.
"04 20, 2015",2010 RAV4,"Not a ""drivers"" car much like most Toyotas; rides like a boat with little road feed-back. Good brakes but you have to look outside to tell that they are working. Seat adjustments are for smaller folks - I am 5'11"" and have the seat ratcheted all the way back and I still feel cramped a bit (my wife loves it though). Great room in back with many space arrangement options, Dealer fixed a factory defect promptly with no hassle. Ride is floaty-rough; could use quieter tires that Michelins on now though they perform very well. Disappointed with 25 MPG (I get 29-31 with my Honda Accord). Upgrade sound is excellent and fault-free."
"06 17, 2014",Happy with my Toyota...,"My salesperson Jean Eddy Mores did an excellent job. I appreciate going out on the rain to check my Toyota :) He made sure our needs were met, he was very courtious and patient. I never leased a car before. This was so easy the sales person went with us all the way. Now he is a friend. Thank you for looking a masculine car for my husband...
Thank you"
"10  7, 2013",Great Ride and Comfort,Easy to maneuver; great rear view for backing up. More room inside than many of the co.mpetitors that are larger
"09 14, 2013",Very good SUV,"Great on gas, very spacious and good for long trips!. Mine came with third row seat which is awesome. So far no a single complain."
"08  2, 2013",Satisfied owner,"I have only driven this car a 1000 miles, but it starts when I put the key in. It was a good value. See me next year for a more informed review..."
"06 29, 2013",Wrong Car,"We ended up buying a 2012. I believe it was listed on cars.com by a Caddy dealer. I know it's buyer beware, but many of the prices for the RAV were way over for the time period and year we were looking for. Also, they tried to lure you to them with untrue promises. We were lucky and car runs fine."
"05 16, 2013",Wow what a great car,"We traded in a Corolla for the 2010 RAV4 and although we have only had it for a short time, we LOVE it. My husband rarely drove the Corolla but I can see he is going to be using the RAV alot. Being retired I was looking for a vehicle that would provide great comfort and thought the looks of the RAV were great. We got the limited and are very impressed so far with all the features. I am so happy I searched and found the car I have been wanting."
"05 10, 2013",Love my Toyota!,"I got great customer service and they really worked with me on the price. I had a budget to stay within and they worked with me to make that happen. I love owning a Toyota! It is very reliable to drive and looks good, which makes me look good!"
"03 22, 2013",Happy so far,Very happy with the vehicle so far. Had it less than a month so can't really comment on reallity so just gave a 4 star based on others reviews.
"03 12, 2013",Love the v6,Fourth RAV4 and so glad that I went for the v6 version w/ this one. I would not go back to a 4 cylinder. The problem is that for 2013 that's all you can get. I'd miss the power. This car has been super reliable and fun to drive. I can get anywhere (snow and mud) and enjoy the gas mileage.
"11 26, 2012",Great Great Vehicle-TOYOTA PLEASE FIX TRANS WHINE!,"The car is very nice inside and out. Ne never had any trouble with the car. Value is great. Quality is very good except for the nagging transimission whining noise from 20-50 MPH or so that has been on all ravs for about a decade. This at times leads to transmisio n failure, and most of the time it is no problem. Now there is a TSB on it with a mount fix that leads nowhere then a trans replacement that does the trick. Good luck convincing them to do anything without a lot of pressure. Getting back to the vehicle, it really is great though besides the noise. It is soo much more than you realize at first. The inside may appear plain but it is actually just nice and simple and de cluttered. LOTS of room and handles GREAT!! Acceleration is like a rocket. There are times where it does not down shift at low speeds like 25mph and is a shocker. Dealer said it is normal due to drive patterns and fuel economy needs. Glove box has a plastic shock that pops off the stub all the time so that you just leave it. The map lites are in the same area as the dome lite in front so when you push it you forget to turn it off thinking it is the dome lite. Then there is not a battery saver that shuts this off. Base steering wheel even is soo comfortable. It has really nice tapers on the spoke coroners. Runs great on 87, great MPG and Power. Tires tend to round or wear on the sides befor e the middle, it may be the tires or the stabilzer makes the car feel so square that when you take an off ramp you go fast and puts a lot of load on the edge of the tires. Love this car. Evey through the little things, no doubt a must have car!! Love it love it love it!!!"
"10 10, 2012",Near Perfect,"I have to say, I wish this car was built in Detroit. The exterior styling is a bit wonky but, like consumer reports said, it's a near perfect SUV. I have a 2010 limited with 3.5L V6 and have put 30k miles on it. The leather seats are comfortable, there's class leading room in the rear seat for two grandparents and car seat. The cargo room is like 37 sq ft with the seats up. That's 1/3 more than the Cayenne and GLK etc. It's plenty fast with almost like 275hp and not as heavy as other SUVs. It's got a backup camera IN THE REARVIEW mirror! I've tried to replace this SUV with something else 20 times due to the RAV being ubiquitous. Nothing comes close. All competing SUVs either cost way more, get way worse mileage, have less rear seat room, less cargo room, or are less reliable or all of the above. It's the pinnacle SUV right now, especially with gas prices at $5."
"09  2, 2012",Pleasant Surprise,"I'm previously owned a Celica (168K mi.), 2 Camrys (266K mi. and 173K mi.) and was looking into a change of Toyota product. Because of its good reviews, I decided on the 2010 Rav4 Limited, V6 FULLY loaded with almost 40K miles. For the last few months this vehicle has been a pleasant surprise...comfortable ride, quick, responsive acceleration, decent gas mileage for a V6, looks great and plenty of room for cargo or our Labrador. Its only been a short time, but, so far...LOVE IT!"
"08  1, 2012",Nice Car,"I bought the 2010 Rav4 Sport. Ive owned it a little over a month and have put approx 3000 miles on it. There is no spare tire on this model unlike the Base Rav4 or Limited Rav4. It has run flat tires that seem loud in the interior when driving. To combat the loud tires I turn up the stereo (cd, am, fm & sat) and the stereo sound is not real good. There is an upgrade to this stereo I would recommend if your into music, find a model with the upgraded stereo. The vehicle also has a 4 cylinder motor, not bad for running around town or to work and back. I test drove the v6 and its like a rocket, it would be nice to have the get up and go when you step on the gas. The interior is well designed with easy access to all the controls. The gas millage is excellent compared to my last vehicle and Im averaging around 24 mpg. The drivers seat is average, mine is not power or leather and that makes a big difference in comfort. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV."
"06  5, 2012",Rav4 Rocks!,"This is my SECOND Rav4. The first one only being taken away (literally) due to it having been totalled out in a wreck. It was a 2007, had 145,000 miles and we still received an EXTREMELY fair check from the insurance company. It paid for a slightly newer, fancier Rav with only 20,000 miles. The insurance adjuster was even surprised at what a ""salvaged"" Rav 4 was worth. The car literally never gave me any trouble. I changed the oil rarely on time, which I don't recommend and quite often went thousands of miles over and yet that car kept driving. We only put new tires on the vehicle 4 times, new brakes after 125,000 miles on the FACTORY brakes and changed the oil in this vehicle. We did do the recommended dealer inspections/spark plug replacement, etc. but other than that, this car ran like a well tuned engine the entire life of the car. We were even laughing that even due to the high miles, we would not need a new one for another 2 years! The interior on our original Rav was base, a bit noisier than our Camry was, but overall, acceptable road noise. The interior of the cabin of both the 2007 and our current 2010 model are designed around the driver. The only complaint we have found so far is the cupholders in the front seat are so close to the drop of the dash board that when you remove a ""Super Size"" cup from the cupholder, it knocks up against the bottom of the dash and will often knock the lid off and spill the drink or crush the cup. As a consequence, you have to tilt the cup to get it out of the cup holder to avoid knocking the lid off, which will sometimes unseat the lid anyway! The interior of this model is a higher end vehicle and rides much quieter and more comfortable which is to be expected with the number of upgrades (from a Base model to a Limited model). The leg room seems to be a problem in the backseat for our 13 year old recently as he is now 5'11"" so I don't recommend this vehicle if you are toting leggy teens more than a few hours. It is comfortable though and the rear seats recline which aids in the leg room issue. The seat also adjusts forward/backward as does the front seat by a bar underneath the seat which is helpful when carrying items behind the rear seat. The amount of carry space when the rear seat is up or down is amazing. We compared it to the Highlander and it is a great deal more. I have YET to be loaded to the max in this vehicle and we use it for our business carrying boxes either flat or packed from one point to another. There are interior ""hidden"" compartments as well underneath the rear floorboard that we have stuffed blankets and stadium seats into in the past along with ice chests, etc. It is amazing how much space this vehicle really has for such a small car. The exterior of the vehicle leaves a little lacking to be desired in style, but performs magically. Our vehicles sit outside all day and all night, not covered and after a recent SOFTBALL sized hail event, my husband's Ford F150 was dinged up pretty badly, my Rav, not a dint,nor ding ,nor chip of paint missing. When we purchased our first model, we got the 4 cylinder engine which was sufficient even driving in Dallas traffic and the gas mileage was wonderful. The 2010 Rav has the more powerful 6cylinder WITH tow package included and it only misses the gas mileage by a mile or two, a wonderful trade off when considering the amount of power we get with the 6 cyl engine. The vehicle shifts smoothly even at top speed when an extra burst is required for changing lanes in traffic and will get away from you at a red light if you are a heavy gas foot/jack rabbit start at the green!
I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone even considering a vehicle for carrying items/smaller SUV. We purchased it as a low gas mileage dependable vehicle for business errands as well as errands for family and it has NEVER let us down, NEVER left us stranded AND NEVER failed to outperform any vehicle I have ever owned from luxury car to luxury LARGE SUV!"
"03 30, 2012",Very nice driver,"Lots of room for a small suv, great on gas easy to get in and out of parking lots.
Very comfortable, smooth and quiet."
"01 24, 2012",Very reliable brand,"The 2010 RAV 4 4 cylinder Automatic all wheel drive is very quiet to drive and provides great elbow and leg room for a family of 4. The 4 cylinder has great fuel economy and excellent acceleration. 2010 Rav 4 has several built in creature comforts - multiple cup holders - some adjustable to accommodate larger cup sizes. Also contains built in features to plug in iPod or other music storage devices. I decided on the 2010 Rav because my family was getting cramped in the 1999 Rav - but we really loved the reliability of the brand and vehicle. Toyota has improved styling, features and space (head room and leg room) in newer model years. I still drive my 1999 which has over 130,000 miles and still runs great. I expect the 2010 Rav to have the same reliability especially with how Toyota backs their vehicles. I have owned Corolla, Camry, and Rav, and would buy or recommend buying to anyone who asks. A bonus is many Toyota's are being produced in the US, so I am helping to support the US workforce."
"12  2, 2011",not relieable,"This car only has one hole to put a key into in the whole car..the dealer only gave us one remote control key which is very unhandy and dangerous.
We should of gotten two keys but they would NOt give us two keys..we already had the car in the shop twice since we bought it in a three weeks time.
I would not buy another RAV 4"
"10 20, 2011",LIMITED is GOOD...some tweaks would be nice.,"Purchased a late model 2010 in June 2011 (first owner was Oct 2010), w. 500 miles. This is primarily wife's commuter and our long-trip car. We have added 4500 miles on it 3 months. It is a Limited V6 auto, all leather interior, rearview camera, etc.... I think the interior leaves a little to be desired in comparison to others. I'm sure a comparable model with the same mileage and age would have been cheaper and have a better ""looking"" interior. But those brands cannot compete with the reliability or the durability of Toyota engines, exteriors and interiors. We expect to hold onto this for 10+ years so we also got the 100k bumper to bumper 8 year warranty and Platinum dealer service package. The V6 is very responsive with plenty of pickup. It is driven every day (avg 12 miles) in town/some interstate and is garage kept. The gas mileage is around 22-25m/g and up to 27m/g on interstate long (2+ hour) trips. The interior controls take a little getting used to. I prefer the mirror controls on the driver door vs. the center console. We have keyless entry/push button start which actually is safer and makes you more aware of where your keys are and what you are doing?we love this feature. But, I would have put the push button start on the left side of steering wheel instead of so close to temperature/radio controls. I've cut off the radio instead of the car more than once. Back seat riders have commented on how much leg room they have and the comfort of the seats. I would have expected rear temperature controls in a Limited. The ride is a little noisier (road contact not wind) than I would have expected for a top-of-the-line RAV4. The steering wheel feels a bit tiny but appropriate for the vehicle. It handles very well in parking lots (turn radius) and at high speeds (changing lanes). There are a lot of these on the road, because they are reliable. There are better LOOKING models from other brands, but the durability of them, IME, is 5-7 years. After that the interior, engines and exterior starts to falter. Aside from the small things mentioned above, I would not hesitate to buy another one. I think it's the perfect car for a married couple with 1 (maybe 2) small kid(s). I think if you have a teen you'll need to get a slightly larger vehicle. It's a joy to drive and Toyota's customer service is top notch."
"07  8, 2011",No-frills utilitarian dependable transport,"I was moving across the country, and the Rav4 was perfect as it had the most cargo volume in its class (36 cubic feet with the backseats up, and 70 with them down - both are tops in the compact crossover SUV segment).

Since purchasing the vehicle 10 months ago, I've now put on almost 10,000 miles on it. My FWD 4 cylinder model is EPA rated for 22/28 mpg, and in my real world experience I find it hard to achieve city driving of 22 mpg on an entire tank. Perhaps more like 18 to 20 mpg. On my cross country road trip, though, I was able to many times break 30 mpg on highway trips. In fact, my best tank clocked in at 32.5 mpg - pretty good. So maybe my experience of mileage is around 19/30. One thing to note - the on board mileage calculator is probably a bit generous. My own fill up measurements usually register around 1 or 2 miles lower.

The interior of the Rav4 is very ergonomic - everything where it should be, and nothing distracts from the road. There are lots of little storage areas for phones, maps, paperwork, coins, pens, cameras, etc. However, I felt that the back seat headrests are a little firm and flat, while the front seats are very cushioned and much more comfortable. One good thing though is that the back seats recline - which is a feature not always able to be had on some other SUVs.

The Rav4 is very agile and has a great turning radius. The acceleration is very sensitive and responsive at low speeds, which means the car is very quick coming out of a light or stop sign. At highway speeds, passing power a little less as good, though still adequate. Going up hills requires the engine to rev a bit.

Visibility is excellent for the most part. I feel the A pillars are a bit big, and I have to pay attention to check the sides at intersections as pedestrians on the crosswalk may get hidden in them.

Overall, I thought my purchase was an excellent value. I would recommend to those looking for lots of interior room on a budget, who are willing to sacrifice a luxurious pampering interior for a more utilitarian ergonomic small SUV that is very practical, quick, and fuel efficient compared to other cars that can deliver similar cargo volume."
"05 25, 2011","Good Car, But,","If you get this car make sure you get one with the upgraded stereo sound system already in the vehicle. The base stereo sucks. Also, had to have at least 3 Nav units replaced on this car. I really can not blame Toyota for this. I took the car to Car Toys and it really was not a better place to go. I finally got the stereo fixed by a dealership aftermarket stereo place and since then have been very happy with this small SUV. It gets 31MPG at 70MPH on the freeway. Thats a very impressive MPG considering that this is the 3.5 motor. The only anoying thing on this car is that the climate system automatically defaults to recercerculating air when the temp is reduced to it's lowest setting. It's irritating to constantly have to take the car off recerculate especially on a hot day when you don't want to run the AC."
"05 23, 2011",Great Overall Value,"I have owned the SUV for 6 months now from new. Only had two items needing correction a loose rearview mirrow screw. And a window rubber seal got caught when I rolled it up. They where easily fixed by the dealer The car came with no charge maintanence for 2yrs and 0% interest for 5yrs. We bought the V-6 Sport model with 4 wheel drive with run flat tires. Between the sport suspension and the run flat tires it rides a little hard at times on a bumpy road. It came with no spare on the back of SUV door but I prefer the look to the mounted tire on the back. It looks great and handles like a sports car. The power is excellant 0-60 in 6.2 seconds. It feels like a large SUV but it is only 182 inches. The second seat has a lot of leg room as big as any large SUV. The back hatch that opens from the side is great if you have a low garage door. Love the relining back seat. Great 2 glove boxes for storage. Speaking of storage. The SUV has plenty of storage areas for your phone, CD's, garage door opener, even a hidden storage in the floor of the trunk. It has a lot of new features like hill assist. limited slip differential, traction control, stability control. The dash looks a little on the cheap side but what do you expect in this price range. Excellant gas mileage and runs on regular gas. All and all it is a well rounded SUV. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Previous stationwagons where BMW and Mercedes. Except for the interior of the RAV the RAV has all the creature comforts you would find in a Stationwagon costing twice the price. I test drove the new redesigned BMW X3 for 2011 and I would stack it up to the BMW any day for 1/2 the price. I can see why MotorTrend gave Toyota ""Small SUV of the Year Award"" for 2006. I have owned Toyota's in the past and the reliabilty is excellant compared to the two German cars we owned. And the repair cost when and if it breaks down won't cost you nearly as much as a German car to repair."
"04 21, 2011",Not for snow,"This was my first leased SUV and I was so excited to finally have an SUV that had 4wd ability as I live out in the country of ND. It handled well in good weather, but there are a issues I noticed in the 7 months I have had the vehicle, especially over the winter months - the road grip is poor when the roads are wet or icy, and in snow, the tires pack so much snow into the wheelwell and caps that you have to clean them out or your AWD/4WD and braking system lights come on and your car shakes all over the place, and if you live in a place where there is lots of snow, that rear window wiper is a constant annoyance. Whenever you turn it on, and there is a lot of snowfall, it will get stuck midway by packed snow and it won't turn itself off - normally leading to a trip back to the dealer to get it fixed. Both need to be re-engineered, along with the coffee cup holders which keep coming out, and the car's seats which are not the most comfortable to sit on."
"04  3, 2011",2010 RAV4...4x4 (base),"i've owned the 2010 RAV4 (base model ) for 3 months...
(CONS) driver's seat - wish it was more comfy.., tilt & telescope steering wheel could be better,Sound system poor placement & quality fair/ average, some blind spots when backing out of parking space,paint is Average/fair. interior could be lil' better...

(PROS.) Does drive good, excels good...I'm getting about 25 MPG's,that's HYW & City (4cyl.)that i like! Handles good.does drive nice, i had no problem with snow this year, never even used the 4x4.,plenty of trunk space, rear-leg room a PLUS.

... Road trip in May to disney world, will see if it passes the long ride?"
"03 28, 2011",Great vehicle for the money.,"Owned for eight months since I leased this vehicle in July 2010. Positive: decent handling and acceleration compare to other Toyota, Honda, and Ford SUVs. Gas mileage is decent, 25MPG average for 4 cylinder 4x4, 70% city driving. Good visibility inside out. Excellent lease deal, $185 a month 15K a year. Two years free maintenance. Negative: Rear seats uncomfortable. Road noise. Poor dealership service experience. No steering wheel mounted controls unless you choose top of the line models."
"03 24, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,Excellent preformance in drive the 4 wheel drive is also good slightly poor in milage 21.5 mpg and good reliability smoot drive
"03 14, 2011",Suprising,"At first when I heard my mom wanted to buy an SUV I thought two things... boring and slow. After she did a little comparison between the RAV4, CRV, and Forester there was one clear winner. The Rav4 was much faster, more comfortable, and provided the same fuel economy as the competitors. She bought a 2010 Rav4 V6 Limited and has never looked back.So far she is extremely happy with her purchase. I must say that after driving the car myself the car is shockingly quick and nimble for an SUV, at least the V6 version is anyway. Overall it is a great car, and I would encourage anyone considering an SUV to at least test drive one."
"03 11, 2011","smooth acc., poor road grip poor coffee cup holder","the limited 2 wd is a much smoother car to drive than sports version or 4 wd. somewhat negative is its poor road grip in turning and on wet road. also, its coffee cup holders are very poorly designed."
"12 23, 2010",WELL PLEASED!!!!,"I have had this SUV for three months and am well pleased, thus far. I like the visibility you have of being higher up than in a car. Not sure but I think there is a blind spot when backing up. I have particularly noticed it when backing from from parking spaces in parking lots. Hope it is as good as my 1999 SOLARA that i just sold with 175,000 miles on it. The SOLARA was a wonderful car and was still very good when I sold it."
"12  4, 2010",Exactly what suits my needs,"This vehicle meets my needs because:
It drives and stops well in snow.
It is comfortable on a long drive.
It gets reasonable gas milage (26.5 mpg avg for 1200 miles, from Calif. to Washington state.)
The design and arrangement of the seats, controls, and storage inside is well thought out and functional.
I frequently drive on Forest Service roads and sometimes with some snow. I have really appreciated the safety features that keep the vehicle tracking straight under power and when breaking. We think it is a safe, reliable and efficient package for use around town, long trips, and traveling on the back roads in the wilderness.
I have towed my small sailboat, had my bike rack on it and hauled mountaineering gear up to the trailhead on snowy roads. All worked well."
"11  4, 2010",First SUV,"So far so good, drives well,,,has a couple blind spots that you have to get used to checking but overall an excellent car."
"10 28, 2010",My first Toyota SUV,"I am always on the go and live in the DFW area and the with the size of the gas tank, I have to fill up twice a week. The base model Rav I have only give me 300 miles w/ full gas tank. I wish it were at least 400. I got what I paid for. Good car for a family of 3, any more will be a tight squeeze. Very strong sturdy vehicle, the little engine is great. Has plenty of storage in the back!"
"10 12, 2010",Exceeded my expectations,"The RAV4 is quieter than I expected and the gas mileage is at least as good as the EPA estimate, if not a little better. I got the V6 which is very responsive. I like that you can lock in the 4 wheel drive at lower speeds. I only wish that it came with a compass since I did not get the navigation."
"10 12, 2010",Better than I expected,"It was a toss-up between the CR-V & RAV4, but after test driving and value-comparing the two vehicles, my new RAV4 Limited won hands down. Features that I love: 4-cyl provides great gas mileage but isn't puny when accelerating (CR-V doesn't have the gusto); stylish interior & exterior (mine is red with grey interior), heated seats, great cargo area (jogging stroller, pack n' play and tons of other baby gear fit with room to spare), XM Satellite, Bluetooth capability...and for all of us parents, the convertible car seat for my 16 month old daughter fits perfect (bench seat reclines to allow for a snug fit). This was a huge concern for me, and the CR-V didn't provide the same kind of fit - I would have had to place a rolled up towel or something similar underneath the car seat to get it to snap snuggly in place. The only drawback to the RAV4 is that the seats aren't conducive to long road trips - they get a little hard on the tushie after a while! I was on the fence given Toyota's reputation as of late, but I'm happy I took the chance - looking forward to driving my RAV4 for years to come."
"10  5, 2010",Love it!,"My husband and I moved to upstate NY and decided that we needed a four wheel drive car able to carry our golf clubs, fishing equipment and found antiques. Our only negative is gas milage. Our other car is a 2004 Toyota Corolla and we just gave our 2001 Hyundai Elantra to our daughter. Both of these vehicles get higher gas mileage. But in every other catagory, it is a 5+!"
"09 30, 2010",RAV4 is a solid car,"Just purchased but its first long distance drive proved it is what we wanted - comfortable, quiet, responsive and miserly on fuel."
"09 18, 2010",mary anns review of rav 4,I enjoy being higher up in the car it is the first time for us. We use to have an Avalon. I feel like I can see better. Very comfortable..............
"09 17, 2010",RAV4 2010 Sport V6 4WD,"Before I got my RAV4 in October 2009 I've test driven Acura RDX, BMW X3, Audi Q5 and Subaru Forester. In my opinion RAV4 V6 is just the best sport SUV for the money.

Pros: The acceleration is great. My black leather interior looks luxurious. The trunk space is big enough for my 2 mountain bikes :)

Cons: Would like to see sharper exterior design. Standard sound system is just ok. No Bluetooth connection.

Toyota Infamous Recall: I haven't had any issues with an acceleration pedal, but I had it replaced by a dealer just in case."
"09  6, 2010",Good car for the money.,"Got a great deal out of a three year lease. Car handles very well for a compact SUV, better than the 2005 Ford Escape I drove before. Ride can be harsh at times and highway wind and tire noise are noticeable. Overall fit and finish is good, material feels a bit cheap though. Honda and Mazda feels more luxurious. Gas mileage is decent for a 4x4 with four cylinder, I get around 25MPG on local roads. Overall I would recommend."
"08 22, 2010",Most noisy new car I have owned,"Bought new RAV4 LTD last week. When I went to pick up the car, it was noisy -- Sounds more like a Diesel engine"
"08 15, 2010",Great for the money,"I bought this car last November (2009) and I love it. It drives and handles really well so far. Unfortunately, it didn't really snow last winter so I was unable to try it on the snow. I have the base 4 cylinder model and was very satisfied with the standard features such as cruise control, keyless entry, Stability control. The interior is spacious both front and back, particularly the big trunk space. This car provides sufficient power and is very agile that it's so fun to drive. This car offers so much for the price. It definitely is a good investment for the money."
"07 11, 2010",RAV4 V6 4WD Limited,I got my RAV4 in October of 2009. If you live where it snows you must own this car! I live in Wisconsin and last winter we got 18 inches of snow one day - I was the only one who made it into the office that day. I don't know how I lived without the bluetooth or keyless entry before this car. I never have to take out my keys! The only gripes are the back door is sometimes awkward and heavy and the seats could be a touch more comfortable. But I would absolutely recommend this car - I love it! Toyota has made me a believer and I will probably buy Toyota from now on. The V6 is the way to go with the RAV4 - Honda is really missing out by not offering a V6 in their CRV. Also - there is LOTS of leg room in the backseat. The seats can be moved backward or forward. I LOVE THIS CAR!
"07  9, 2010",Ravtom,"A good value and trusted Toyota reliability. The purchase process was also painless, and started with cars.com."
"05  4, 2010",Bells and Whistles Gal,"I bought a NEW Toyota Rav4 2010 in March 2010. I bought it because I had driven a 1997 Rav4 for 10 years, sold it , and have been sorry ever since. I am so pleased. It is a V6 Limited with everything and I love each and every little gizmo. This car is ME. Thank you Toyota, the bells and whistles are a 10!"
"04 19, 2010",I wish you could try them out for a month,"I bought a limited which had many nice features. I was disappointed with the stereo. I am 5'8"" and it is even difficult for me to get the driver seat back far enough to be comfortable driving. It also feels like the seats angles toward the door which is uncomfortable for long periods of time since I commute. The ride is somewhat rough. Otherwise, it is quite roomy and appears to be well made except for the several new car rattles. The gas mileage could be better. It is fun to drive and looks nice. Love the heated seats and the cargo space. The back hatch would be better if it opened from the curbside and not the other which makes loading difficult if you are parked on the street."
"04 19, 2010",So far a nice car,I am pleased with the features on my RAV4 limited. It is not too big but it does have great back seat room.
"04 16, 2010",What a Car What A Deal,"Took ownership of a 2010 Toyota Rav4 Limited in March and could not be happier. Go a head everyone and dish Toyota. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. The auto is great, I compaired it with a Subaru (I own now, big differance in quality) a crv (felt like a van). Has all the options plus I know it will last."
"04 15, 2010",Rav4 6cyl. LTD with Nav.,"This little SUV does the job but that is about it. Great power but the interior lacks certain details that should be expected for the top model.
The radio is horrific, not even good for a Yugo.

All over the interior you can see coast cutting efforts and yet the car is not so cheap. Leasing it is worth it. Maybe one of the best value lease out there.
For what I need it is fine, but I would have expected more."
"04  9, 2010",great combination of space and fuel economy,"I was sold on RAV4 during my test drive, when I made a almost 135 degree sharp right turn into a side road. Given its size, the handling was remarkable well. Feeling that even V4 gave me sufficient power, I saw no reason to get a V6. I have a long commute to work, 3/4 of it on the high way. I am truly amazed getting just over 30 MPG after two weeks driving. Granted, I am not a spirited driver and seems always get more than the window sticker number on MPG ( I get average 38 out of another car in the family, '10 Corolla in the last 7 month). I am nevertheless very pleased.

Its cargo space is surprisingly large and well laid out, although the interior materials somehow feels cheap with too much hard plastics - truly unfortunate drift by Toyota and now lagged behind Hyundai. The tires have a little bit too much road noise but so do the models from other brand. I initially thought the 4 speed auto made RAV4 look like a decade back comparing with its competitors in the class. But with the smooth ride and remarkable fuel economy, I no longer think it matters.

Recent safety recall no doubt made me think twice. But I have owned several Toyota, including a recalled '10 Corolla. I am not entirely sold by the headline story. All the negative publicity, however, did lead a great deal, including the 0% finance for 60 month. Dealer was also more willing to negotiate. Everything combined, Hyundai no longer has the price advantage and CRV became outright silly. So far, I have no regret with my purchase."
"04  1, 2010",Great Vehicle,"I recently purchased a brand new RAV4 because of the great deals Toyota was offering. I typically wouldnt be able to afford this vehicle but am very happy i was... I purchased the Base Model V6 with AWD and must say i couldnt be more impressed. The V6 has a ton of get up and go, and the options on the base model are hands down better than any other base model SUV. Only minor complaint would be that the seats could be more comfortable. LOVE IT SO FAR"
"03 24, 2010",I expect better from Toyota,"This is a very good car, but could have been great with a some more thoughtful user friendly design. No interior latch on the rear hatch is a bummer when sitting back there and changing into wet suit, bike pants, ski clothes etc. Also, when opening rear hatch, snow on roof falls INTO car. Similar problem on side doors. Center dash heater vents are hard to aim and you can't fully shut them off. Max roof weight of 200lbs is not enough for all my gear. Secondary glove box is hokey and poorly made. Automatic gear shifter drives me crazy. Very difficult to find gears when driving at night and clunky operation. The car is overly computerized. It's constantly beeping at me for some reason or another which is very distracting. Like what's up with the ""traction"" warning like I don't already know that I am sliding around on the snow and don't need to be distracted by warning bells and whistles. And every time I put a bag of groceries on the passenger seat, the no seat belt warning starts going off. Silly, but I guess that is modern cars."
"03 23, 2010",awesome rav4!!!,"I've been looking for a step up from my Toyota Solara for a while now. I settled on the Rav4 after test driving the Ford Edge (close second) and the Honda CR-V (disappointing). The Rav4 excells in comfort, styling, looks and fun! I had to wait to get my V6 in blue, but I love, love, love it!!!"
"03 16, 2010",Big improvement,"This is the 3rd Rav4 I have owned. It is a huge improvement over earlier years although at the time, I thought they were great. The new, bigger 4 cylinder engine handles the extra weight of the longer, wider Rav4 with ease. The extra cargo room is greatly appreciated by my dog and the ride is smooth. The traction and stability controls make winter driving a breeze."
"02 25, 2010",Still have faith in Toyota,"I purchased a 2010 Rav 4 Limited v6 in Nov. 2009. I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The Rav is small and sporty, yet gives me the room for 2 kids. Do your homework, and don't believe the media hype if you are a Toyota fan..."
"01 28, 2010",Great small SUV,"After much research looking at CRV, Subaru Outback & Forester, Chevy Equinox, etc, I settled on the RAV4.

I wanted good gas mileage, good in snow, room for a family of 5 plus the occasional 6 or 7th passenger & dependable. So far I think this fits the bill.

Mileage has been in upper 20's (~27) around town-we bought the 4 cylinder. It drives nice in our snowy NH winter w/good ground clearance/traction. We purchased the 3rd row seat & while small, fits our 2 boys (age 11 & 13), at least for short trips. It's too early to tell re:reliability but it has a good reputation & presumably this will hold up.

I wish the accelerator issue hadn't arisen. That adds new meaning to the Toyota slogan ""moving forward"". Toyota better get that cleared up or they will lose a lot of customers.

My only thought for improvement is I wish it was offered in a manual transmission &/or hybrid engine. Otherwise a great solid package."
"01 13, 2010",Great compact SUV,"This is my first SUV. I have owned this car for over two months now and I am very happy so far. I have the V6 4X4 limited model with NAV and leather seats.

Likes: Very quick and nimble with good ride quality. The back-up camera works well with the spare tire on the rear. The NAV system works well. You cannot input destinations while moving, but all Toyota's are like this. The bluetooth works well.

Dislikes: The driver seat position is OK, but the steering wheel blocks some of the warning lights. The glove box rattles a little."
"01  3, 2010",Very good value!,This is my first suv and I have only had it a month so I can't really compare it. But so far so good!
"01  1, 2010",Great Value - Fun to Drive - First Foreign Car,"Likes: Exterior sporty styling, INCLUDING the rear mounted spare with solid cover; roof cargo rack with rails; better than 26 MPG combined highway/city driving on new engine; interior room; large controls for climate system; center arm rest in back seat; airbags all around; telescoping/tilt steering wheel (a necessity for this vehicle); very responsive steering; 4-cylinder engine has enough power to merge into traffic and climb the hills; and vehicle FEELS solid and well-built when driving.

Dislikes: Seats are pretty firm and takes some getting used to after having a luxury van with leather seats; needs wind/rain deflectors on side windows, which I plan to add very soon. That's all so far.

Overall: I am very impressed with this vehicle, especially when you consider the price point, and Toyota's reputation for safety and resale value. For a Base model, FWD, 4-cylinder RAV, the new 2010 definitely delivers."
"12 19, 2009",One Great Compact Suv,"When I drove it (Base 4 cyl. 4 WD) the first time I loved how comfortably it drove. The handling is excellent...very smooth on the road. I thought the RAV4 controlled and dampened the bumps very well will little noise. Making turns was very easy. The power is more than adequate when starting from a stop position. I like the exterior for its new ruggedness and style, particularly the front grille. Although it was a base model and it had those steel wheels, the overall exterior is appealing and nice to look at. I also like the interior, though not as much as the exterior. Still, I found the HVAC controls very visible, assessible and easy to use. I think Toyota did a decent job with the type of materials on the dashboard. The seats are fairly comfortable. For what it's worth, I believe that the RAV4 does offer a variety of basic features such as air- conditioning, power doors, keyless entry, Brake assist... I bought the 2010 RAV4 last month and I've had so much driving pleasure. It's
a fun compact suv to drive."
"12 30, 2023",Great value in a dependable fun used car,"We bought a 2011 AWD base model for our daughter just as the pandemic was starting. Three years later it has 120,000 miles on it and runs flawlessly. I just put on new shocks and struts and it rides like new. The driver side front axle seal needed replacement. The V6 has power to spare even in the mountain west, and makes it fun to drive. It's now worth a bit more than we paid for it."
"11  4, 2023",Still runs great!,"This is the best, most reliable car I have ever owned. Other than seals on the rear differential, I have done nothing to the car, other than brakes and routine maintenance. We have 157000 miles on it and it runs like new."
"11 23, 2022",2011 Toyota rav 4,I bought this vehicle used. Grinds when you go 30 miles an hour I want to know if there is recalls on vehicle and how to get them
"06 13, 2021",Best vehicle I have ever owned,"It is spacious, very comfortable more especially long distance. 
I still prefer this model in terms of looks as opposed to new models.
It is very low maintenance. I just love it"
"05 13, 2021","I love this car, so much!","This car, “Angel” is her name, is such a wonderful car, I just love it so much. I purchased it from a previous owner who had purchased it brand new when it came out but only drove it from home to a train station parking lot and then back home, the entire time. It had about 60k  miles on it and was in stellar condition. I just had to buy all new tires and just replaced the battery, last month. 

When I bought it in 2020, I was elated to have just found such a grand deal and my word, it has lived up to my expectations and then some. It’s so easy to drive. It is very comfortable, inside, the trunk and storage room back there is ample and with optimal care ( I take great care of this car, no slacking) it runs like a dream. 

Gas mileage is pretty good. I use ‘Plus’ gas in it. During a recent drive from Jersey to SC and back,  I filled up approx. every 4 hours at 1/4 tank left but yeah, I drove and opened that baby up like she’s never seen and quite frankly, it feels like it drives even better now, after that trip.

I love this car. It’s just big enough for me and stylishly speaking, it’s super cute. The only thing is that I’m a ‘sunroof’ person. My very first car had a sunroof and I’ve loved them ever since but I get enough sun and light through all of this cars windows so, well, that’s my only wish. 

Anyway, did I say ‘I love this car’, already? She is a dreamboat and I will drive her and care for her until she takes her last trek and breath :)
Adventure; we’ve got a lot to get into."
"01  7, 2021",Wouldn’t want any other car to be my first!,"The performance on this car is fantastic, from great gas miles and the smooth V6 engine, this car is runs great. Comfortable interior, very spacious and you don’t feel every bump in the road. Extra under storage in the trunk is so convenient. Feels very safe to be in as well. Only issue is back seat tracks are rusted from previous owner not cleaning water from a storm of the metal properly after leaving windows open, so they squeak when going over bumps. Other than that, I love my Rav4!"
"12 12, 2020",Great driving vehicle!,The RAV4 drives excellent! I now own 4 Toyotas! I absolutely love them! This is my first RAV4. It drives great and handles even better!
"11  9, 2020","I've enjoyed my RAV4, it takes me where I want","It is attractive, reliable, handles well and has never failed me.  I like the wheel on the back because I can find it in the parking lot"
"06 22, 2020",Spacious for a compact.,"Very impressed with the turning radius and the ease at which the engine tackles hills and speed. Very comfortable, and the air works very well. The back has plenty of room to pack my stuff. I do wish this vehicle had a tire on the back like the 12 that I saw, but that might just be an optional feature."
"06 12, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever had.,"My car has made me feel safe when I'm driving anywhere, especially in the winter times. When I decide to buy another car it will be a Toyota."
"06  8, 2020",Dependable and good all around.,"This car has a strong V6, good fuel economy, decent comfort and durability, and looks good.  Radio interface is far outdated but JBL speakers sound great.  Shock boots tear and lead to some squeaking but no major issues.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
"06  1, 2020",21 MPG city 28 MPG highway,"4th Toyota RAV I owned over the years, fully loaded & detailed! Best SUV on the road, safety, durability & lasting! I have 2019 & 2020 also. Never uses a drop of oil between changes."
"04 26, 2020",Excellent vehicle,"One of the best vehicles for Midwest, with AWD option it is same good for    highway, off road or winter driving. With 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine has a very good gas mileage."
"03 15, 2020",I love this car.,"This isn't the fanciest car in the world, but it is perfect for me. It is easy to park and is peppy enough to merge into traffic, and easy to get in and out of and there is lots of space for dogs, shopping, and all the crap I haul around. And, it gets decent gas milage. My favorite thing is the good visibility I have when driving."
"03  9, 2020",Always wanted SUV,I love this vehicle comfortable  spaces drives nice  I loved the color handles very nice  I have that have owned more  then one they always Owned Rav 4
"03  8, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever owned,Soon as I saw this car I knew it wuz the one I would love to own very happy with style and performance looking forward to many years with it
"02 27, 2020",Great Outdoor Adventure Car,"It has been a great go hiking, drag the kids to the in-laws, escape to the beach car. It has great mileage and is very comfy."
"02  2, 2020",Drove for 60k miles and its great!,"Great car for all weather and terrains. Even with the base model, the capabilities of this car are still great almost ten years later. Drives great and have never had issues with traction in winter or on wet roads. Cheap to maintain and handles great!"
"12 25, 2019",Smooth ride and reliable,Blue tooth ready has 3rd row seating lots of leg room heated seats push button engine start roomy cargo area great for hauling lumber supplies
"12 11, 2019",My 1st car I have ever owned,"This Rav4 car did everything it was asked of and more by my family, my friends, And I. This car has more than enough room to carry a full-size double refrigerator or eight people. It great on gas mileage as well"
"11 24, 2019",Like a Timex,"4 wheel drive a major plus. Just 7 "" ground clearance, but it isn't a Wrangler.

Interior lights are TOO DIM. Have a flashlight handy. 

Good milage, easy maintenance."
"11  9, 2019",Very cheap on gas and comfortable driving.,The car has a lot of room and easy on gas. Very reliable and no issues with the car. Just Keep it maintained and will last long.
"09 14, 2019",Seems reliable but not impressed,"After 8 years, only 57000 miles, several recalls, local Toyota dealer refused to service vehicle or provide warranty recalls after purchase,  dealer refused to provide oil changes per contract and national Toyota advertisement - told me they did not realize it was expensive 0W-20 synthetic oil ( this was in 2011), Bluetooth is calls only, front cup holders do not hold taller cups, drives like go-cart  (steering is very sensitive), rough noisy  ride, things are glitchy - Bluetooth sometimes go out, back up camera sometimes goes out but mine is NOT included in the national recall, front left window makes loud cracking noise when going up, seats front and rear are not comfortable, front windshield has been replaced 3 times in 3 years - prone to damage,  original tires were the worst replaced at 25,000 miles,  difficulty getting replacement parts,  cowel on rear wheels sticks out 1/2"" and gets pitted by rocks - looks bad.  I do not want another Toyota."
"09 13, 2019",A great car at a great price.,"Comfortable, fun, and Toyota reliability. Very spacious for a small SUV.  Easy to maintain, and handles great. A great car for the price, I could not recommend it more."
"09  7, 2019",Best car I have ever owned,"My wife loved this car because it is easy to get in and out of, it has heated seats, and really ll good on gas."
"07 26, 2019",Trust and feel safe in this vehicle,"Love this vehicle and everything about it. It replaced an older model so 
we are very happy with the upgrades in this one. Loved the dealership we used to procure this vehicle!"
"06 29, 2019",Love  how it drives and how it is comfortable,The car has met our needs. It is very roomy in the front and back.  I love that it drives great and is comfortable for everyone.
"04 26, 2019",It has been very reliable so far.,This car has met all my expectations. Love the way it handles the road. The ride is great compare to all cars I tested.  Still looks good for being a used car.
"04 18, 2019",Love my car. Hate constant dash lights,"For last five  years, my dashboard on my 2011 Toyota RAV 4 has had check engine, four wheel drive, and traction control lights on. At inspection time, we spend $95 for a machine to tell us that the O2 sensor needs replacing and $80 for a new sensor. 19 to 20 miles after we get the sticker, the dash lights come back on and stay that way for another year. We just paid $80 for a different sensor before going to get a sticker and lights didn’t stay off long enough to get to a garage to get inspected. Called Downeast Toyota in Brewer where we bought the car and it will cost another $95 to have the diagnostic machine tell us the same thing again. Fed up is the least of my feelings."
"02  5, 2019",Back To Toyota For Reliability,"A sporty little ride. Basic and no-frills, but gets from Point A to Point B. Good on gas, and with some snow tires added will go where I need to go."
"01  9, 2019",Best Car Purchase in Years,I am very happy with this car.  It has the distinct body styling I prefer and has handled well even in the ice and snow.  I find it easy to drive and reminds me of my classic 1999 Honda CRV (which I would clone if I could).
"12 16, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"Excellent car but 2 main issues one the AC not good , and two the breaks keeps tearing off fast and not that strong as Nissan but have no idea about other Toyota models but over all Toyota cars n trucks are 100% reliable and re selling value cars"

"11 30, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"A comfortable ride, plenty of room for transporting people from place to place. Great for going camping in the mountains, and lots of room for camping equipment."
"11 26, 2018",A Good Buy for the Money,"I purchased the Rav 4 because (1) it is a Toyota and (2) it has low mileage for a 2011 vehicle 26,000 miles). I wanted a small SUV with low mileage, a great reputation for reliability, a full size spare tire, 4 wheel drive, , attractiveness, and fuel economy.  I was actually looking for a V6 but settled for a 4 cylinder (2.5 liter) since I would get better fuel economy."
"11 22, 2018","Bought new . Now rav has 45,000 mi. Never failed .","In 45,000 miles the rav has never failed to get me where I was going . Last month my city had a flood . I had to go get my 3rd grader from school asap. The streets over near the school were pretty deep in some spots . The 2 wheel drive 4 cyl. Rav when right through the water , although I was worried about it drowning out . Rav got us home without a sputter. Lots of things I like about rav , most of all she?s paid for ,lol ."
"10 10, 2018",I feel comfort when I drove this car,comfortable car I am satisfy with this car. This car is within my budget. I need this car for my family purpose. It will upgrade my status so i will try buy one of this car.

"07 31, 2018",Lifetime value,Timeless styling. Go kart like handling with amazing fuel efficiency. At 7 years old this vehicle performs and looks like it's brand new. The quality and engineering are so over the top compared to the competition at this level that it?s  no comparison. I?ll never settle for less again.
"07 16, 2018",I am own,"Great car.Good driving and comfort.

"05 13, 2018",Perfect car to trust,"This car is totally worth the money do to performance, comfort, exterior styling , reliability  and most important durability. Never a complain or waste my time on mechanics. 
I want a new car but it will be hard to let the rav4 go. Therefore I am not looking for a car.
I am loyal to Toyota rav4"
"04 29, 2018",First AWD I've owned,This car is great. The AWD also has the 4 wheel lock so I can feel confident getting out in the rain and snow. I live a mile from a blacktop road so this gives me peace of mind. The RAV4 has plenty of room for passengers as well as a cargo area. The seats are comfortable and there's a lot of legroom. With multiple storage compartments there's no cramming everything into a single glove box. The car is easy to get in and out of which is really nice when I'm feeling my age. I love the side opening rear door instead of a hatchback.
"04  7, 2018",very reliable and sturdy,"bought it for my twins got them through high school and college and never let us down.
very dependable and reliable . very good in the snow and ice also if you get the 4 wheel drive version"
"03 28, 2018",I have a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 Limited V6-like new,"It was an excellent vehicle until a dealership suggested a transmission flush.  Ran like a dream turned it on it parking lot after, ROUGH IDLE!!"
"03 12, 2018",awsome car,"Great experience, Everyone was kind and helpful. I drove away  with it the same day I went to see it. They worked with me and in the end they owed me 5 bucks."
"03  1, 2018",Very Reliable,"I haven't owned this car very long but it is awesome! Roomy and very comfortable, fun to drive. Great sporty looking car, even for a grandma!"
"02 20, 2018",Sharp vehicle new family member,"Love the body style, color. & performance. Great car for the price. All the bells & whistles I could want. Lots of power when needed."
"02 16, 2018",Family Friendly vehicle with lots of boot space,"The V6 engine does its job great with An excellent pickup , comfortable seating  and driving position . Very reliable family car with lots of boot space"
"02  9, 2018",Very Reliable vehicle,I like it. Has lots of room and storage. Has side safety air bags. Best in crash tests. Love the styling. I love the sun roof.
"01 26, 2018","Best Value for Money SUV , Very Reliable",The specific Model year with the sport rear tyre on the back door is one of the best stylish features of the car. Solid performance and comfortable ride quality.
"12 22, 2017",great car,"This car is reliable, great in the snow and roomy enough for my family. I thought I would not mind the door opening to the side on the back of the car but it is the only thing that I don't like."
"11 26, 2017",Haven't had it for very long but it is nice,"The 2011 RAV4 sport I just got is very nice.  It has plenty of room, rides nice, plenty of features and I like the responsive steering."
"11 21, 2017",Loved it.,"We loved our Rav4 2011 model. Very dependable, absolutely no problems with it, other than a new battery. We enjoyed hauling new plants home, but kept it very clean. We got another Rav4 because this one was so good."
"10 27, 2017",Low mileage car for great price!,"This car is a real GEM! Only 31,500 miles on it.  Newer Tires and Battery. Very clean inside and out. Great family car, or very safe car for new student driver. Has sunroof, Bluetooth, cargo area cover, CD/Radio, power windows/steering, white exterior with beige cloth interior, lots of storage compartments!"
"09 22, 2017",Most reliable and nice car I've owned,"Strongly built, quiet, and smooth. Beautiful look and sleek exterior and interior design. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats For large family."
"09 18, 2017",Loved everything about this car!,"I needed a car with plenty of leg room in the back seat. Rav 4 has it!  It is super clean, super comfortable, rides great....I can't say enough about this car.  I think it was meant for me to own."
"09  8, 2017",First comfortable car I've owned,I looked at many vehicles and this was the only one that fit me good.  As a short person I am able to put the seat up enough to reach the pedals without feeling to close to the steering wheel and after breaking my back this SUV is very comfortable.  I love all the features it comes with.  I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends.
"09  7, 2017",Nice car,"Great little SUV.  27 mpg+, quiet, loads of interior space.  Tailgate mounted swinging spare tire is a drawback."
"09  7, 2017",Best SUV,I've owned a couple of older RAV4's and absolutely love them!  You can't beat Toyota for reliability and performance. If I had to pick only one all around car to own it would an older model RAV.
"09  6, 2017",great price   good value,"I Love this car       Great in the snow and bad weather .   Superb power yet great fuel economy, huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height,,,comfortable ride"
"08 18, 2017","Great value, very dependable!","Best money I have ever spent. I have driven this car 140,000 miles in 5 years and only have had to replace brakes, tires and oil! The V6 is very strong and efficient."
"08 17, 2017",Smooth stylish ride!,"I absolutely love my Toyota Rav4 it's comfortable for my whole family and drives smoothly and quietly! You do have to be careful with the transmission fluid if it's low or too full it will shift a little rough from reverse to drive but if you have just the right amount it is smooth as can be. I was very surprised by the trunk space for this smaller suv but having the spare tire on the tailgate makes all the difference, I am excited to play with this car in the snow and se how it does!"
"08  6, 2017",very reliable,Fun to drive. I feel safe and comfortable.  It is easy to dive. I have no blind spots.  Good ac and stereo.
"08  4, 2017",Love love love my RAV 4,"I own two Toyota RAV4 4's, a 2011 and a 2009. They are both work horses. V6 gives me the power to tow, and enough torque to quickly accelerate onto the highway. I was not a fan of the newer 4 cylinder versions so I have purchased two of the older V6 (no longer produced).  One of these was purchased due to storage room in the back end for my son that is a Hockey Goalie and he hauls a lot of large gear."
"08  2, 2017","Comfort, style, economy","Love my used RAV4! So comfortable and stylish, roomy and great on gas! Plenty of room and easy to drive. And so many extra touches!"
"08  1, 2017",A very dependable utility buggy,This is a great car - SUV- or whatever you want to call it. It's very dependable and useful. The cargo area is deceptively large when the back seat is folded down. I've been able to carry a small couch in there. I also got a double bed to fit one day. This is a super useful vehicle.
"07 18, 2017","Sporty, great handling, holds everything I need!",This SUV holds much more than I expected. Handles great in snow/ice. Big enough for three adults to sit comfortably in the back seat.
"07 12, 2017",Rock solid reliability!,"Solid, smooth engine. A little underpowered with the 4 cylinder and 4wd. The transmission is very smooth. It is awesome in snow and averages 22 mpg city. My only complaint would be the highway fuel mileage. Manufacturer claims 27 on highway. Best I've seen is 26, but usually average 24-25. I guess it's because it only a 4 speed transmission."
"07 12, 2017",Best car for the money,The nicest used car I've ever owned it rides and handles really sporty for being an suv I would recommend this car to anyone.
"07  9, 2017",Reliability is outstanding for all road conditions,"Well thought out vehicle for real life atmosphere that people encounter everyday. Suspension is great, very reliable and drives smooth. Wasn't a fan of Toyota. Now that I bought one. Very impressed with the performance that I see in the vehicle. 4x4 is great. Engineering in vehicle is well planned and would think it took the simplest thought of what you wished or wanted out of a vehicle.  Especially in bad weather or bad road conditions."
"07  8, 2017",Second of 2 Ravs.,"This vehicle meets all my needs. Great style, comfort and handling. Just the right size for our needs."
"06 15, 2017",Graduated to Rav 4 after 20 years in Sienns,My kids are all grown and I was ready for something fun and less mom. I found that in the Rav 4!! It's zippier than a minivan but still has the compact feel of a car. I love the look and drive but do wish the seats were a bit comfier.
"06  1, 2017",Nicest Upgrade in Several Years,"Was looking for an AWD SUV that would fit the short space available in my garage.  This RAV4 had almost all the options I sought, good cargo room, fair power (for a 4 cyl), and feels good in the driver's seat.  Front passenger seat not as comfortable because it doesn't have the height adjust like driver's.  Only had this car a couple weeks, so reliability rating is of previous Toyota experience.  Used to be a GM person, but Toyota and Honda both have both won me over from several of the recent GM I've worked on or driven."
"05 14, 2017",Kgorkin,Best vehicle I have owned.  No issues keep the maintenance up and it will run forever. Geat in the snow plenty of power. Thhe 3rd generation is the one to have. My wfe has a 2013 4th gen we like the old one better.
"05 10, 2017",Perfect Compact SUV,This is a great lil SUV. Holds 4 adults fairly comfortably and the one we have has all the options so that makes the ride even better.
"04  6, 2017",Reliable !,Very reliable with the plenty of power V6 option available. In the RAV4 sport that we own it has great power and great torque to do what we need to do and go where we need to go with the all wheel drive
"03 28, 2017",As expected and a little more,"Toyota has built a great reputation and I expected the RAV4 to follow suit. Luxury was not what I was looking for, but functionality. Visibility is great in this car, it has lots of room and has a lot more pep from its four cylinder than my '05 Escape with a V6. Trivial items like the floor shifter stem looks ""thin"", the ""headlights are on"" dash indicator light a little bright and the driver's seat seatbelt receptacle too low, but nothing of extreme annoyance. I enjoy driving this car."
"03 28, 2017",Great car for distance comfortable and good on gas,Toyota makes a great reliable car that has excellent gas mileage . The Toyota Rav 4 is great for travel and vacations. Lots of room for luggage and passengers. I would recommend this car to all my family and friends.
"03 28, 2017",RAV4 overview,Stylish and practical with good value for the money. Only drawback is the seats not comfortable enough.
"03 24, 2017",Another reliable Toyota,"I have owned numerous cars but my Toyota Sienna was by far the most reliable and cheapest vehicle to maintain. When I was in the market for a replacement vehicle I went right for the Toyota again only this time I don't need minivan as my kids are grown.
The Rav 4 drives lovely, is trying and has a lot of features that make driving comfortable and convenient!  So far I love everything about it and I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it like I did my Sienna."
"03 21, 2017",the word dependable and that no lie,I wake in the morning that all is good with  this rav4. they build convince in there cars and faith that is my the best for my family.
"03 15, 2017",Toyota Rav4 2011,Its a confort car and Smoth and is safe and thanks form the saler Juan Gamara for his excelent atention
"03 13, 2017",Great Value,"This car gets great gas millage, has good cargo capacity, and very reliable all for an affordable price."
"03  9, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"I just purchased this vehicle.  It was highly recommended to me.  It's comfort, performance, exterior styling, interior design all deserve a 5* rating, as well as value for the money and reliability.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"12 11, 2016",I love it,"This is my second RAV4 and I've loved them both! Good looking, smooth ride, lots of space. Toyota is reliable and I plan on driving this for a long time."
"11 24, 2016",2011 Rav 4,Always enjoyed this brand   Rav 4  is a good SUV style for a reasonable price and gas mileage.  I recommend to anyone looking to get out of a car and into something a little different
"01  8, 2016",Wilfredo Vega Best Sales Associate,"Thank you for everything, we appreciate everything that you have helped me with. I didn't have great credit but you managed a way for me to make it work! I have a great car thanks to Wilfredo Vega, sales and leasing consultant.

Thank you from Mr. and Mrs. Ventura"
"09  9, 2014",Reliable and comfortable,I purchased the car few months back and I have good experience. I am really enjoying the SUV drive. I like the pick up. Most of the times i have issues in the Cruise control speed adjusting sometimes it takes huge pickup suddenly kind of jerk. Everything is good but I see few things especially the suspension is not as good as it is. Rear Seats are comfortable only for two and if third person sits then it would be congested.
"03 28, 2014",Best Small SUV I've Owned!,"I've owned an Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Cherokee, and a Honda CRV. THis little gem is by far my favorite. I'm short, so the adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel are a huge plus for me. It handles like a dream and has a peppy pick-up. I have the leather package and sunroof, and it gives it a sporty feel.
It rains a lot in New Orleans, and our streets aren't the smoothest, which is why I drive SUVs. This little baby is a dream for these conditions. The back seat has ample leg room, and the controls are within easy reach. I love it."
"12  7, 2013",Everything I expected and more,"We recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 sport from Toyota of Manhattan and really love the car, and we also had a very pleasant experience with all of the staff at the dealership, very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and much to my surprise we are getting slightly better MPG than our other SUV that we traded in. I also have slightly more cargo space than I did before and the car is very comfortable and handles very well. I've owned many Toyotas and have never been disappointed with their products, it looks like we found another quality car that will serve us well for many years to come."
"11  1, 2013",Watch for paint issues,"I have paint coming off of the roof between the windshield and sunroof. I showed this to the dealer and they raised the issue to Toyota. Since the car has over the 36K miles warrantee I was simply told they don't care and it was not their problem. The car is less than 36 months old and because of my job I have to put on more miles. You will notice paint issues. The depth of paint varies on the roof from the rest of the car as measured at the dealership.
Realize that there is NO advantage to having a Toyota over any of the other manufacturers. The quality is not better nor is the service."
"06 30, 2013",Great smaller alternative to the Highlander,"I traded my highlander for the rav4. Yes, smaller and less room, but gas mileage, reliability, small easy to maneuver...worth the trade. Tough at first, I lived my highlander, but w gas priced and no longer needing the extra room, I'm very happy w the trade. Mine is the bade model e the ESV pkg...I.e. moonroof, bigger nicer rims and tires, 6 CDplayer. ONE BAD THING...huge for me,maybe not for you. The radio stinks!!! DDoesn't go anywhere near adas loud as my highlander. I'm learning to live w it. Oh yeah, I bought used and the person before added a Bluetooth. Love this!!! If you don't have one, get one. Worth every penny!!!"
"06 23, 2013",Quite happy with it!,It's only been a month since I got my used RAV4. So far I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to someone with a brain injury or with depth perception problems. After years in a lower car I feel I have better command of the road.
"06 19, 2013",good car,this is a good car for me and my freinds and family i only use it in the snowing months. with winter in this area . it has all wheal drive.
"04 17, 2013",Best and Safest car my daughter has ever had,"This 2011 RAV4 replaces a 2004 RAV4 with 166,000 miles that was in an accident and totalled, the 2004 was still in great shape and trouble free. This 2011 RAV4 is a phenomenal car, great value, great inside and outside styling, the 4 cylinder engine is economical and peppy, the 4 speed automatic transmission is smooth, the 4 wheel disc brakes stop great, the AWD system is flawless, seats are comfortable, the inside space is great, the comfort features are wonderful, this RAV4 has the Run Flat tires that ride a little harsh but convenient in case of a flat, the moon/sunroof is a treat and the multi-CD radio sounds great. If you're looking for a small AWD SUV, this is such a great choice, not the most luxurious but such a great value, I'll buy another RAV4 anytime without hesitation."
"01 26, 2013",Quality with power and excellent mileage.,"Smooth power, spacious, comfortable, and extremely well built. Handles well and easy to get into. Fully featured. Only wish it had 6 or 7 speed transmission which would probably help produce better gas mileage. Still satisfied with the mileage considering the horse power this car has. Would recomend to friends and family"
"12 25, 2012",Have to wait and see how it works..just bought it,Loooks good so far................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"08 14, 2012",BUTNING RAV4 SPORT,"Ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy, it?s not a family car. I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. It burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 2 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's not too bad. Now I just add oil every other month, after 4-recall I think I made a big mistake buying the RAV4."
"06 26, 2012",New Toyota rav 4Limited nice ride,"This limited Rav4 has leather moon roof power heated seats etc;I love the appearance,the ride and performance of this vehicle.I am glad I bought the v6 the engine it is smooth and quiet.The storng acceleration and performance is worth the extrta money. the gas mileage of mixed driving in hilly terrain is 23mpg. I am anxious to take it on A trip. I only have 1200 miles.The ext. is Blizzard Pearl,with tan leather and a tan pin stripe. The 4 cylinder performance was adequate , but not fun to drive like the v6."
"06  4, 2012",Nice suv,"Nice small SUV. Still gives the ""feel"" of a bigger and taller SUV, but compact...seems nearly as large inside as my 2003 Highlander."
"05 14, 2012",My 2011 Rav4 V6 sport,"After I purchased my 2011 Rav V6 sport there was a rattling noise coming from the moonroof that was horribly ruining my early ownership experience. Dealer kept the car three days and managed to replace the wind deflector but even with the new wind deflector on the noise was still there although not as loud as before. It's been one month and a half and I am realizing that the drive shaft whines considerably loud at low speeds(30-45 mph). I am definitely having that looked but the car had only 7300 miles on it when I bought it and it is bothering me to the point I would not consider buying used anymore. There is only one thing I will have to say that the V6 is strong and fast and that the car is pretty good looking too, compare to the competition. The fact that it is a Sport model and comes with tuned suspension makes the ride harsh and stiff. You may consider that prior to purchasing. Bottom line, Toyota lacks bells and whistles so if you are into technology, innovation, and interior quality, today's Rav4 does not offer anything exciting. Reliability has also dropped in my opinion since this is the second Rav I own. I am sorry but it is just a plain car that has lost its vision and more importantly has forgotten what sport really means."
"04 17, 2012",2011 Rav 4,"Excellent styling. The performance of the v-6 is also excellent. I've been driving on snow and ice. The ABS, 4WD, and the stock all weather 18"" tires work very well together."
"03 30, 2012",I love the 6 cyl. zip!,"I've owned the RAV4 for a year now & do daily commuting & the occasional long road trip. I wish the gas mileage was better, but I like the extra power of the V-6; it has a smooth ride & good handling. There are lots of extra features I enjoy (heated seats, 4WD, back up cam, sunroof) & the styling is reasonable but not flashy. A nice, solid vehicle."
"03  4, 2012",2011 RAV4 4cyl. 4x4 OK but disappointed,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. engine 4x4. This was purchased as my mom's golden years vehicle. She wanted something she could see out of, was up high/easy to get in and out of, small-ish and got good gas mileage. Also, all the bells and whistles my dad refused to get in the past, so she chose an almost fully loaded Limited model.

Went with 4 cylinder engine to maximize MPG, but my area is short on front wheel drive 'Limited' models, so ended up with the 4 wheel drive. At the time of purchase, Toyota.com said 2 wheel drive models were not available for sale in my area (Md.). I don't know if this was due to the tsunami or just a regular sales decision.

There is no hill-holder or hill brake on the automatic transmission in the 4 cylinder model, so when you start on a steep hill the car rolls back like a manual transmission car. Really unnerves my mom. She tries to avoid hills. I've heard the hill brake may be an option (?) you can purchase, but seeing as she bought a Limited version and it didn't come with it, I doubt it. Maybe the front wheel drive only version has it? The V-6 does have it. We didn't encounter any substantial hills on our test drives so it didn't appear to be as rolly as it really is on big hills.

The gas mileage is awful for old lady drivers. My mom's short 2-5 mile stop-sign racing at 25-35 mph speeds result in 16-17mpg. But, one trip over 10 miles on the highway will bump the average to over 20mpg, but still nowhere near the big print advertised mileage, much closer to the small low end fine print mileage for the V-6. The ""break in period"" is bogus. Did average 28-30 mpg on a long interstate trip, but we cared more about the around town mileage.

I am 6'3"" and I find the seats to be slightly off. Seat bottoms are not quite wide enough or long enough, but it's not my car. But, at least your almost level with your co-pilot versus the Subaru Forester where the co-pilot sits down in a hole with the dash board at eye level. Overall, you can't beat the room available in the RAV4. Very roomy front and back. Oh, we only got the 2 rows of seats.

As most everyone notes, the swing out tailgate is not great, but you can learn to work with it. Only thing you can't work around is when it's raining; you don't have any cover and the rain just goes right in the back.

Overall the RAV4 is a great vehicle. The 4 cylinder has a lot of pep. More than enough to get you moving. Ride is tops for the type of vehicle, but by no means smooth or sedan-like. Wind and road noise is quieter than CR-V, but not as quiet as a sedan. Speaking of the CR-V, the RAV4 doesn't have any strong vibrations through the steering wheel when stopped at a light like the CR-V. That was a bit unnerving on our CR-V test drives. You'd be sitting at a light and it would just vibrate your arms. I think it was tied to the power steering and A/C system. Anyways, one of the cons for the CR-V that led to the RAV4 purchase. The interior details are great in the RAV4: cup holders, outlets, folding seats, sliding seats, armrest and glove boxes. The only other thing I don't like are the LCD displays. They look dated and detract from the style of the interior. A quibble, but eh..."
"01 30, 2012",First time Toyota Suv,"Engine...(4 cyl) transmission a little noisy when accelerating. But has plenty of power for 4 cyl.

Looks....Clean and Sharp exterior, interior space is the most available in small Sub class. seats have been comfortable on trips and general driving.

Radio....I don't Like not as good sounding as I would have e
Xspected..

Price......base model $ 21,000

I would recommend this vehicle 4-5 stars."
"01  3, 2012",Disappointed,"We own a 2011 4 cylinder front wheel drive RAV-4. The gas milage is not as good as we expected. We get about 20 per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.
Three times in two months the SUV engine raced and jumped while we were backing up. Toyta kept the car for three days and could not reproduce the issue.
This is our third Toyota SUV and our last. Toyota SUV's are not as reliable as their sedans. Toyota SUV's are not woth the price!"
"01  2, 2012",just breaking it in,"I like the way the car handles, the gas mileage is up and down, I have owned it for two months now, I have 2000 miles on it. I have not gotten more then 23 MPG at the highest and 18 MPG lowest. I have not driven more then 100 miles at a stretch on the highway. I am hoping it works itself into better MPG. I don't like the light color of cloth on interior doors. It really shows dirt and stains easily . other then this, I really like the car. It is
4 cylinder 4wd. It has power, for a 4 cylinder."
"12 27, 2011","New 2011 RAV4, LIMITED, Experience","Purchased the LIMITED V6 4x4 in Pacific Blue fully loaded with the exception of navigation. Since I own a Garmin, no sense in having both. JBL + Bluetooth, leather, tint, tow + more! Don't drive a V6 because you will ultimately buy it! Very comfortable ride although thirsty in the city with around 17-18 mpg around town, which is not too bad. No long trips yet, but should get 22 + even with weight of 4x4 and engine. Interior is good, but would have liked some upgrade in materials, however nicely crafted and roomy. Towing will be easy with the tow package and powerful engine. Little to no changes in 2012. Buy at end of month for good deal. Used prices are high so I opted for new, since they hold their value well. Not cheap, but all the vehicle one would need for travel, sport, etc."
"12 26, 2011",2011 RAV4,Solid basic small SUV. No real frills but it is reliable. Averaging 25 MPG city and 26.5 highway. Only compliant-road noise.
"12 23, 2011",new to toyota,"After much research..alot done on cars.com, I went with the Rav 4...based on reviews and material that I read. So far I am very happy with my choice...the 4 cylinder impresses me with its power and ease..the vehicle feels safe and solid...my last SUV was a 2000 Explorer and this is far superior in every way."
"12 13, 2011",Great Machine,"Great car for the money. V-6 motor and transmission combination better than before. Leather and options definitely make the car more enjoyable. Still has the dopey dashboard and odd interior design choices, but lots of SUV for the money. Anything else is $3,000-$5,000 more for the power and options."
"12  6, 2011",Excellent ride,When shopping I drove every 4 cyl all wheel drive car on the market. Rav4 was my first ride and ended going back and buying. Excellent handling and gas milage isn't bad either. I would reccommend to any one looking for an all wheel drive vehicle
"11 17, 2011",MOST DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AROUND.,"I OWNED A TOYOTA CAMARY FROM 1989 UNTIL 1999 AND IT STILL WAS DEPENDABLE AT 200,000 MILES AND THE NEXT VEHICLE I BOUGHT WAS A TOYOTA RAV. 4, 1999 MODEL AND STILL OWN IT WITH 155,000 MILES AND IT STILL DRIVES GREAT. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS VEHICLE FOR COMFORT, RELIABILITY, GOOD LOOKING, SPACIOUS, AND KEEPS ON TICKING. LOVE TOYOTA"
"11 15, 2011",Just what I wanted,This is an excellent car. It's exactly what I was looking for. I go on a lot of road trips so I wanted 4 wheel drive and a lot of cargo room. This car definitely has both. It is very reliable and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
"10 17, 2011",The Do Everything Vehicle,"We have the 2011 V6 Limited version with most of the extras except the navigation tool. Great gas mileage, great response on the highway, turns on a dime and extremely responsive. From the outside it appears quite compact. I have taken 80"" doors in for repair, transported a 5' bathtub from Home Depot to our home. Taken grandkids on various trips, 4 golfers including myself with all our gear. Looks good, rides great, never a fear of it not performing as advertised when we purchased it."
"10  4, 2011",Rav4,"We drove the Rav to Austin, TX and back to Seattle roundtrip of over 6000 miles. The ride was comfortable and enjoyable!"
"09 27, 2011",Great car,"We bought the RAV4 4 wheel drive V6. Incredibly, it gets better mileage than my Honda CRV even though the RAV4 has far superior performance. It also has more cargo space and a quieter ride. THe radio is quite good.
THe only cons include an annoying squeak in the dashboard and the inferior tires that they equip the car with that we were warned would not last for too long. THe tires are Bridgestone Duelers.
This is one sweet ride and I expect it to handle our harsh winters well once we get better tires on it for winter driving.

One other con relates to the fact that the car which cost a considerable amount does not include floor mats which to me is shocking."
"08 26, 2011",First Toyota,"I have always owned Hondas and I love the look and the way the Toyota drives. It is sporty and I'm a not a Mini Van Mom driver anymore. I have the extra seats if I need to drive my kids friends. It gets great gas mileage, and so easy to get in and out of space?"
"08 21, 2011",Great Car,"In February 2011 I purchased a Toyota Rav4. So far I have been very pleased with the car except for two things 1) I cannot buckle the middle seat belt in the back seat. It has some sort of dual lock but even with the manual I can't see how it works. I think something is wrong with it. I am going to have to contact the dealer because no one I know can figure it out. Since we have the optional third row we have never needed to use that buckle yet. 2) I am not happy with the car doors, especially the back seat doors. You have to really slam them to get them to close tight on the first try and when they close (this applies to all the doors) it sounds like a tin can. The sound makes the car seem really cheap. If pressed to list any and all complaints I guess I would have to say that I dislike clock and the placement it, it makes the interior of the car look very dated to me. Although after having the car for a month or so I was completely used to it. Other than these few minor things (I will contact the dealer to fix or explain the seat belt) I really love the car. It has a nice smooth ride and so far it has been great."
"07 29, 2011",Exactly what I was looking for.,"I needed a family car with cargo room that still had some sportiness to it. The 2011 Rav4 met all of my needs, and made letting go of my beloved (and still running great) '99 Honda Prelude palatable."
"07 28, 2011",Affordible SUV,"Satisfied but new models should have:
1. six speed trans,
2. better seats with wider backs
3. better tires
4. Get better MPG"
"07 21, 2011",2011 Rav 4,An ok car but a little light on the bells and whistles for the money. Runs ok but a little rough compared to other small SUVs.
"07  8, 2011",Good Car,"It is a good car. I liked the third row seats. I can used it when I need. Otherwise, I can fold them down. I installed a navigation from Toyoter Service. I don't like the installed Navigation. It has some problems. Perhaps, Toyota's factory installed navigation is better."
"06  2, 2011",NICE CAR,"NICE SIZE SUV, HAS EVERY THING YOU WOULD NEED FOR COMFORT AND RIDE. HAS GOOD STYLING FOR ITS SIZE. VERY COMPETIVE IN ITS SIZE"
"05 30, 2011",Fall In Love again,"Love LOve LOVe LOVE this little suv! I am the mom of three grown boys(two still in college),when I get in my Rav4 and head down the road I feel 16 again. This car does anything I ask it to do. The only thing I can really complain about and it's very minor, when I close the door it sounds a little tinnie. It is a 4 cylinder front wheel drive and it has plenty of get up and go. I am very happy with my purchase just ask my kids. My three favorite things about my car are keyless entry, keyless start and the sunroof. I would highly recommend you give the Rav4 a try you just might fall in love again."
"05 27, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"Last car owned 2001 RAV4

Negatives: Stripping along side of car to prevent
other car doors damaging, is much,
much smaller and not well placed.

Gear shifting is complicated by manufac-
turer trying to give some semblence to a
standard transmission. Writer's first car
was a standard transmission.

Interior arrangement and seemingly un-
necessary placement of some operative
instrument are confusing. Once again,
the manufacturer is reaching out in des-
peration to make the newest model dif-
ferent. Too bad, the first few years the
models changed little if at all. It all be-
gan when they extended the body 14"",
playing havoc with the MPG and making
it difficult to park in a two car garage.

Toyota. You really going to print this?"
"05 20, 2011",Versatile and Fun,"Bought new 4x4 Limited with v6 in 2009. Have 43,000 miles on car. This is the best car I have ever owned and am still waiting for something to break!
Lightning fast, steady and quiet at 75mph, and great breaking. 26mpg at 75. 31mpg at 60mph.
I tow a small boat easily.
Seat are comfortable, back seat roomy, and storage a plenty. I like the spare outside to gain the interior room.
I also like the swing out rear door because I no longer hit my head on old mini van rear door.
JBL Sound system, blue tooth, sirius radio, and i pod plug in all work great."
"05 16, 2011",A very good car,"A fund car to drive and very peppy for a four cylinder
Model.a little less economy than advertise but still
Efficient."
"05 11, 2011",Greatest value for the money.,"I purchased the Sport model. It came with lots of extras including a six cylinder engine. The salesperson told me that the difference in gas mileage between the four cylinder and six cylinder engine is only one mile per gallon. I am impressed by the roominess inside. The height, width and depth of the driver's seat suits me perfectly. The steering wheel is adjustible as to the angle and space from the dash. The combination of ample room and adjustibility is perfect for driver comfort.

The six cylinder engine and four speed transmission results in responsive and smooth acceleration for interstate access. The cargo area is spacious and the flattening of the 2nd row seats is easy and can be controlled from the rear of the car.

I also appreciate the quiet cabin. Very little, if any, road or wind noise. The video screen that appears in the rear view mirror makes for safer backing than just the mirrors. All in all, I have no complaints and find it difficult to think of a single problem with this car."
"05  5, 2011",Perfect for me and grandkids,"I have the seven passenger Rav 4 and it is perfect for hauling my grandchildren around in, as three in car seats and one on the way to be in car seat, so had to have room, but yet wanted good gas mileage and this vehicle was exactly what I was looking for."
"04 30, 2011",Limited V-6 4WD,"Short front seats leads to backache & fatigue even on short trips on 5'9"" driver. Power tilt on driver side does not angle high enough at front of seat. V-6 jumpy on throttle from a stop. Limited rides stiffly over bumps and road reflectors. Versatile sliding, folding, reclining rear seat. Rear seat pull downs from the hatch area are useful. Navigation system is poor and couldn't get the JBL radio with the Nav. Oil change surprise on V-6 since the oil filter is paper and the filter itself costs $35-$50! After living with it, no longer satisfied."
"04 27, 2011","Comfortable, sporty, all around great","We were looking for a car that you could get in and out of easily (sits up higher) and this was the ticket! Also it is roomy without being extremely big.
Feels good from every aspect.
Very pleased."
"04 26, 2011",Great Car,"The V6 Rav4 is a great car - fast, fun to drive, easy to maneuver. The MP3 changer is great. I wish the steering mounted controls were standard on every trim - but it can be added afterwards without much trouble (people on RAV4 forums have done this). Mine has the 3rd row seats. They are small but usable for short trips around town. Only dislike on styling is the rear mounted spare tire - wish it were hidden like the CR-V."
"04 23, 2011",2011 RAV4 V6 4WD vs 2009 CRV EX AWD,"I traded in my 2009 Honda CR-V, EX, AWD on the 2011 Toyota RAV4, Limited, V6, 4WD. Both were bought new by me.
CRV Pros:
Better exterior looks.
Better seating comfort.
Lift hatchback rear door.
Feels like it has more interior room than RAV4.
CRV Cons:
Severely under powered for even routine driving.
RAV4 V6 Pros:
GREAT power!
Almost the same fuel milage as the 4 cyl CRV.
Twice the towing capacity.
Ability to lock in the 4WD manually (not available on CRV).
Climate control.
Full-size spare.
RAV4 V6 Cons:
The side opening rear door sucks!
The back seat is not sized for adults. The back rest height barely comes up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Definitely not sized for anything more than small children.
Very dated orange-yellow back lighting as opposed to the modern looking blue in the CRV.

For me, the three selling points for the RAV4 are the fantastic V6 with it's great power and MPG. The ability to manually lock-in the 4WD. And, it can tow more than the CRV.
I WOULD NOT buy the CRV because of the ridiculously under powered nature of the engine. It is horrible! However, if the CRV was available with the V6 similar to the RAV4 I would unquestionably buy the CRV over the RAV4.
I hope this helps someone considering the two SUVs."
"04  5, 2011",Very reliable car,"Big change from my old 2003 Rav4. Ride has improved and road noise is greatly reduced.
V6 engine runs smooth and much more power than the 4 cyl. engine."
"03 31, 2011",Best 4wd vehicle I have ever owned!,"Drives like a car while performing like an SUV. Simple, sturdy and reliable with a superb blend of attributes."
"03 27, 2011",merced toyota is the best,The RAV4 is a very different type of vehicle than the sedans and coupes previously owned. The RAV4 has great forward visibility. It feels bigger than it looks. The base model features are good.
"03 25, 2011",2011 RAV 4 review,"My second RAV4, a number of enhancements have been made on my LTD model since the 2007 model year I previously owned. The V6 is a great engine but my previous RAV had an annoying whine at 60 to 65 mph. Improvements in the electronically controlled transmission software have made the 2011 whisper quiet at these speeds. The smart key entry system works flawlessly and is great when you've got armfuls of stuff and can't fish the key out of your pocket. It even works when I'm wearing gloves. Zero squeaks or rattles, even in cold weather. V6 combined mileage has been in the 24 to 26 range, really good for a V6 4WD. Poor weather handling has been excellent, very stable on bad roads. No regrets in buying another one."
"03 22, 2011",Great Car,I had a Rav4 as a rental & decided to buy one. Best car I've ever owned & a good sized SUV for the city.
"03 22, 2011",Great in Snow & Ice,RAV4 handles well in the poorest of road conditions. Gives the driver the confidence in the cars ability to get you to your destination. Wind noise with rear windows cracked or open is quite annoying. Standard drivers seat can get uncomfortable. Rear window seems to get dirty quite easily. GREAT forward visability!
"03 14, 2011",Great car,"We recently sold our 2002 4Runner and bought a 2011 RAV4 sport. We look the outside and the intrerior is very well designed. The seats are comfortable and the interior has ample room for everything we need to fit, including the 2 car seats we'll be putting in later this year when our twins arrive. Ample power as the 179 hp is only slightly less than the '02 4Runner V6. It sips gas for an SUV."
"03 12, 2011",RAV4 Then and Now 2002-2011,Owned a 2002 RAV4 before buying this 2011 version. The new model is around 20% bigger and this change has more of an impact than I thought it would. On the plus side there is a lot more cargo room with or without the back seats folded down (I did not get the third row seat version) and more head room for taller passengers. On the minus side this is now a mid to large SUV so no more squeezing into the only tight parking spot left. I miss the ability I had with my 2002 version of taking out the rear seats for more cargo room and better gas mileage. However with the 2011 you get an extra glove box shelf and a variety of driver seat adjustments. Over all I like the new car and like anything new it takes some getting used to.
"03  8, 2011",the best,I am completely satisfied with the Rav SPORT model for 2011 Styling and comfort as well as satellite radio -best Toyota I have ever owned.
"03  5, 2011",2011 Toyota RAV4,"I love the car so far. It's quiet yet responsive. I have driven it in the snow and heavy rain. The Interiers are easy to use and all needed. Handling is great.

However, shouldn't the XM radio subscription come free with the deal, rather than just 3 months?"
"03  5, 2011",Great vehicle,I have the v6 model and it has great power along with shure footed in snow. Lots of room inside and a comfortable ride.
"03  1, 2011",the car that exceeded my expectations,"I wanted a compact SUV that gets good gas mileage,has a third row seat for my kids and comes in red!Did my research and came up with the RAV4 that I've been eyeing for a couple years already for its looks. We found one in a neighboring state and picked it up without even test driving it.No regrets as the Limited V6 has awesome acceleration!Talk about zoom,zoom!I live in Reno and its been great in the snow.My fellow musicians are in awe of the JBL speakers too."
"02 22, 2011",Glad I bought it!,"I bought this vehicle just as the snows descended on New England. I couldn't get this car to slip or slide! The V6 has ample horsepower, tranny shifts smoothly, butter-soft acceleration. I hope to keep it a very long time..."
"01 29, 2011",Bumpy ride,This SUV does not have the smoothest ride. You feel every bump on the road. It makes me wish I bought a regular car for a better ride. I wouldn't buy another one. I should have checked out the Honda's.
"12 30, 2010",I LOVE my new Rav4,"After 14 years as a Camry owner, I am a real Toyota believer. Even with the bad publicity Toyota endured earlier in 2010, I was not swayed from their product lines. However, I did want to sit up higher and have more visibility, so I decided to check out the Rav4 Limited, and I can't be happier with my decision. For once, I did not stint on the options, and already I am loving the heated leather seats (the cold winter in NYC so far has allowed me to really appreciate them) and the stereo system is fantastic. But the ride is the best - smooth, powerful, and pretty economical on the gas (though a bit less than the Camry, its true). I love the styling both outside and in, and feel I am a king in my new car."
"12  6, 2010",Rav4 for Mom,Mom loves it. Not the car for me but for her it is perfect. She lives in Colorado and it works great in the snow.
"12 30, 2023",Great value in a dependable fun used car,"We bought a 2011 AWD base model for our daughter just as the pandemic was starting. Three years later it has 120,000 miles on it and runs flawlessly. I just put on new shocks and struts and it rides like new. The driver side front axle seal needed replacement. The V6 has power to spare even in the mountain west, and makes it fun to drive. It's now worth a bit more than we paid for it."
"11  4, 2023",Still runs great!,"This is the best, most reliable car I have ever owned. Other than seals on the rear differential, I have done nothing to the car, other than brakes and routine maintenance. We have 157000 miles on it and it runs like new."
"11 23, 2022",2011 Toyota rav 4,I bought this vehicle used. Grinds when you go 30 miles an hour I want to know if there is recalls on vehicle and how to get them
"06 13, 2021",Best vehicle I have ever owned,"It is spacious, very comfortable more especially long distance. 
I still prefer this model in terms of looks as opposed to new models.
It is very low maintenance. I just love it"
"05 13, 2021","I love this car, so much!","This car, “Angel” is her name, is such a wonderful car, I just love it so much. I purchased it from a previous owner who had purchased it brand new when it came out but only drove it from home to a train station parking lot and then back home, the entire time. It had about 60k  miles on it and was in stellar condition. I just had to buy all new tires and just replaced the battery, last month. 

When I bought it in 2020, I was elated to have just found such a grand deal and my word, it has lived up to my expectations and then some. It’s so easy to drive. It is very comfortable, inside, the trunk and storage room back there is ample and with optimal care ( I take great care of this car, no slacking) it runs like a dream. 

Gas mileage is pretty good. I use ‘Plus’ gas in it. During a recent drive from Jersey to SC and back,  I filled up approx. every 4 hours at 1/4 tank left but yeah, I drove and opened that baby up like she’s never seen and quite frankly, it feels like it drives even better now, after that trip.

I love this car. It’s just big enough for me and stylishly speaking, it’s super cute. The only thing is that I’m a ‘sunroof’ person. My very first car had a sunroof and I’ve loved them ever since but I get enough sun and light through all of this cars windows so, well, that’s my only wish. 

Anyway, did I say ‘I love this car’, already? She is a dreamboat and I will drive her and care for her until she takes her last trek and breath :)
Adventure; we’ve got a lot to get into."
"01  7, 2021",Wouldn’t want any other car to be my first!,"The performance on this car is fantastic, from great gas miles and the smooth V6 engine, this car is runs great. Comfortable interior, very spacious and you don’t feel every bump in the road. Extra under storage in the trunk is so convenient. Feels very safe to be in as well. Only issue is back seat tracks are rusted from previous owner not cleaning water from a storm of the metal properly after leaving windows open, so they squeak when going over bumps. Other than that, I love my Rav4!"
"12 12, 2020",Great driving vehicle!,The RAV4 drives excellent! I now own 4 Toyotas! I absolutely love them! This is my first RAV4. It drives great and handles even better!
"11  9, 2020","I've enjoyed my RAV4, it takes me where I want","It is attractive, reliable, handles well and has never failed me.  I like the wheel on the back because I can find it in the parking lot"
"06 22, 2020",Spacious for a compact.,"Very impressed with the turning radius and the ease at which the engine tackles hills and speed. Very comfortable, and the air works very well. The back has plenty of room to pack my stuff. I do wish this vehicle had a tire on the back like the 12 that I saw, but that might just be an optional feature."
"06 12, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever had.,"My car has made me feel safe when I'm driving anywhere, especially in the winter times. When I decide to buy another car it will be a Toyota."
"06  8, 2020",Dependable and good all around.,"This car has a strong V6, good fuel economy, decent comfort and durability, and looks good.  Radio interface is far outdated but JBL speakers sound great.  Shock boots tear and lead to some squeaking but no major issues.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
"06  1, 2020",21 MPG city 28 MPG highway,"4th Toyota RAV I owned over the years, fully loaded & detailed! Best SUV on the road, safety, durability & lasting! I have 2019 & 2020 also. Never uses a drop of oil between changes."
"04 26, 2020",Excellent vehicle,"One of the best vehicles for Midwest, with AWD option it is same good for    highway, off road or winter driving. With 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine has a very good gas mileage."
"03 15, 2020",I love this car.,"This isn't the fanciest car in the world, but it is perfect for me. It is easy to park and is peppy enough to merge into traffic, and easy to get in and out of and there is lots of space for dogs, shopping, and all the crap I haul around. And, it gets decent gas milage. My favorite thing is the good visibility I have when driving."
"03  9, 2020",Always wanted SUV,I love this vehicle comfortable  spaces drives nice  I loved the color handles very nice  I have that have owned more  then one they always Owned Rav 4
"03  8, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever owned,Soon as I saw this car I knew it wuz the one I would love to own very happy with style and performance looking forward to many years with it
"02 27, 2020",Great Outdoor Adventure Car,"It has been a great go hiking, drag the kids to the in-laws, escape to the beach car. It has great mileage and is very comfy."
"02  2, 2020",Drove for 60k miles and its great!,"Great car for all weather and terrains. Even with the base model, the capabilities of this car are still great almost ten years later. Drives great and have never had issues with traction in winter or on wet roads. Cheap to maintain and handles great!"
"12 25, 2019",Smooth ride and reliable,Blue tooth ready has 3rd row seating lots of leg room heated seats push button engine start roomy cargo area great for hauling lumber supplies
"12 11, 2019",My 1st car I have ever owned,"This Rav4 car did everything it was asked of and more by my family, my friends, And I. This car has more than enough room to carry a full-size double refrigerator or eight people. It great on gas mileage as well"
"11 24, 2019",Like a Timex,"4 wheel drive a major plus. Just 7 "" ground clearance, but it isn't a Wrangler.

Interior lights are TOO DIM. Have a flashlight handy. 

Good milage, easy maintenance."
"11  9, 2019",Very cheap on gas and comfortable driving.,The car has a lot of room and easy on gas. Very reliable and no issues with the car. Just Keep it maintained and will last long.
"09 14, 2019",Seems reliable but not impressed,"After 8 years, only 57000 miles, several recalls, local Toyota dealer refused to service vehicle or provide warranty recalls after purchase,  dealer refused to provide oil changes per contract and national Toyota advertisement - told me they did not realize it was expensive 0W-20 synthetic oil ( this was in 2011), Bluetooth is calls only, front cup holders do not hold taller cups, drives like go-cart  (steering is very sensitive), rough noisy  ride, things are glitchy - Bluetooth sometimes go out, back up camera sometimes goes out but mine is NOT included in the national recall, front left window makes loud cracking noise when going up, seats front and rear are not comfortable, front windshield has been replaced 3 times in 3 years - prone to damage,  original tires were the worst replaced at 25,000 miles,  difficulty getting replacement parts,  cowel on rear wheels sticks out 1/2"" and gets pitted by rocks - looks bad.  I do not want another Toyota."
"09 13, 2019",A great car at a great price.,"Comfortable, fun, and Toyota reliability. Very spacious for a small SUV.  Easy to maintain, and handles great. A great car for the price, I could not recommend it more."

we are very happy with the upgrades in this one. Loved the dealership we used to procure this vehicle!"
"06 29, 2019",Love  how it drives and how it is comfortable,The car has met our needs. It is very roomy in the front and back.  I love that it drives great and is comfortable for everyone.
"04 26, 2019",It has been very reliable so far.,This car has met all my expectations. Love the way it handles the road. The ride is great compare to all cars I tested.  Still looks good for being a used car.
"04 18, 2019",Love my car. Hate constant dash lights,"For last five  years, my dashboard on my 2011 Toyota RAV 4 has had check engine, four wheel drive, and traction control lights on. At inspection time, we spend $95 for a machine to tell us that the O2 sensor needs replacing and $80 for a new sensor. 19 to 20 miles after we get the sticker, the dash lights come back on and stay that way for another year. We just paid $80 for a different sensor before going to get a sticker and lights didn’t stay off long enough to get to a garage to get inspected. Called Downeast Toyota in Brewer where we bought the car and it will cost another $95 to have the diagnostic machine tell us the same thing again. Fed up is the least of my feelings."
"02  5, 2019",Back To Toyota For Reliability,"A sporty little ride. Basic and no-frills, but gets from Point A to Point B. Good on gas, and with some snow tires added will go where I need to go."
"01  9, 2019",Best Car Purchase in Years,I am very happy with this car.  It has the distinct body styling I prefer and has handled well even in the ice and snow.  I find it easy to drive and reminds me of my classic 1999 Honda CRV (which I would clone if I could).
"12 16, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"Excellent car but 2 main issues one the AC not good , and two the breaks keeps tearing off fast and not that strong as Nissan but have no idea about other Toyota models but over all Toyota cars n trucks are 100% reliable and re selling value cars"

"11 30, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"A comfortable ride, plenty of room for transporting people from place to place. Great for going camping in the mountains, and lots of room for camping equipment."
"11 26, 2018",A Good Buy for the Money,"I purchased the Rav 4 because (1) it is a Toyota and (2) it has low mileage for a 2011 vehicle 26,000 miles). I wanted a small SUV with low mileage, a great reputation for reliability, a full size spare tire, 4 wheel drive, , attractiveness, and fuel economy.  I was actually looking for a V6 but settled for a 4 cylinder (2.5 liter) since I would get better fuel economy."
"11 22, 2018","Bought new . Now rav has 45,000 mi. Never failed .","In 45,000 miles the rav has never failed to get me where I was going . Last month my city had a flood . I had to go get my 3rd grader from school asap. The streets over near the school were pretty deep in some spots . The 2 wheel drive 4 cyl. Rav when right through the water , although I was worried about it drowning out . Rav got us home without a sputter. Lots of things I like about rav , most of all she?s paid for ,lol ."

"07 31, 2018",Lifetime value,Timeless styling. Go kart like handling with amazing fuel efficiency. At 7 years old this vehicle performs and looks like it's brand new. The quality and engineering are so over the top compared to the competition at this level that it?s  no comparison. I?ll never settle for less again.

I want a new car but it will be hard to let the rav4 go. Therefore I am not looking for a car.
I am loyal to Toyota rav4"
"04 29, 2018",First AWD I've owned,This car is great. The AWD also has the 4 wheel lock so I can feel confident getting out in the rain and snow. I live a mile from a blacktop road so this gives me peace of mind. The RAV4 has plenty of room for passengers as well as a cargo area. The seats are comfortable and there's a lot of legroom. With multiple storage compartments there's no cramming everything into a single glove box. The car is easy to get in and out of which is really nice when I'm feeling my age. I love the side opening rear door instead of a hatchback.
"04  7, 2018",very reliable and sturdy,"bought it for my twins got them through high school and college and never let us down.
very dependable and reliable . very good in the snow and ice also if you get the 4 wheel drive version"

"02  9, 2018",Very Reliable vehicle,I like it. Has lots of room and storage. Has side safety air bags. Best in crash tests. Love the styling. I love the sun roof.
"01 26, 2018","Best Value for Money SUV , Very Reliable",The specific Model year with the sport rear tyre on the back door is one of the best stylish features of the car. Solid performance and comfortable ride quality.
"12 22, 2017",great car,"This car is reliable, great in the snow and roomy enough for my family. I thought I would not mind the door opening to the side on the back of the car but it is the only thing that I don't like."
"11 26, 2017",Haven't had it for very long but it is nice,"The 2011 RAV4 sport I just got is very nice.  It has plenty of room, rides nice, plenty of features and I like the responsive steering."
"11 21, 2017",Loved it.,"We loved our Rav4 2011 model. Very dependable, absolutely no problems with it, other than a new battery. We enjoyed hauling new plants home, but kept it very clean. We got another Rav4 because this one was so good."
"10 27, 2017",Low mileage car for great price!,"This car is a real GEM! Only 31,500 miles on it.  Newer Tires and Battery. Very clean inside and out. Great family car, or very safe car for new student driver. Has sunroof, Bluetooth, cargo area cover, CD/Radio, power windows/steering, white exterior with beige cloth interior, lots of storage compartments!"
"09 22, 2017",Most reliable and nice car I've owned,"Strongly built, quiet, and smooth. Beautiful look and sleek exterior and interior design. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats For large family."
"09 18, 2017",Loved everything about this car!,"I needed a car with plenty of leg room in the back seat. Rav 4 has it!  It is super clean, super comfortable, rides great....I can't say enough about this car.  I think it was meant for me to own."
"09  8, 2017",First comfortable car I've owned,I looked at many vehicles and this was the only one that fit me good.  As a short person I am able to put the seat up enough to reach the pedals without feeling to close to the steering wheel and after breaking my back this SUV is very comfortable.  I love all the features it comes with.  I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends.
"09  7, 2017",Nice car,"Great little SUV.  27 mpg+, quiet, loads of interior space.  Tailgate mounted swinging spare tire is a drawback."
"09  7, 2017",Best SUV,I've owned a couple of older RAV4's and absolutely love them!  You can't beat Toyota for reliability and performance. If I had to pick only one all around car to own it would an older model RAV.
"09  6, 2017",great price   good value,"I Love this car       Great in the snow and bad weather .   Superb power yet great fuel economy, huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height,,,comfortable ride"
"08 18, 2017","Great value, very dependable!","Best money I have ever spent. I have driven this car 140,000 miles in 5 years and only have had to replace brakes, tires and oil! The V6 is very strong and efficient."
"08 17, 2017",Smooth stylish ride!,"I absolutely love my Toyota Rav4 it's comfortable for my whole family and drives smoothly and quietly! You do have to be careful with the transmission fluid if it's low or too full it will shift a little rough from reverse to drive but if you have just the right amount it is smooth as can be. I was very surprised by the trunk space for this smaller suv but having the spare tire on the tailgate makes all the difference, I am excited to play with this car in the snow and se how it does!"
"08  6, 2017",very reliable,Fun to drive. I feel safe and comfortable.  It is easy to dive. I have no blind spots.  Good ac and stereo.
"08  4, 2017",Love love love my RAV 4,"I own two Toyota RAV4 4's, a 2011 and a 2009. They are both work horses. V6 gives me the power to tow, and enough torque to quickly accelerate onto the highway. I was not a fan of the newer 4 cylinder versions so I have purchased two of the older V6 (no longer produced).  One of these was purchased due to storage room in the back end for my son that is a Hockey Goalie and he hauls a lot of large gear."
"08  2, 2017","Comfort, style, economy","Love my used RAV4! So comfortable and stylish, roomy and great on gas! Plenty of room and easy to drive. And so many extra touches!"
"08  1, 2017",A very dependable utility buggy,This is a great car - SUV- or whatever you want to call it. It's very dependable and useful. The cargo area is deceptively large when the back seat is folded down. I've been able to carry a small couch in there. I also got a double bed to fit one day. This is a super useful vehicle.
"07 18, 2017","Sporty, great handling, holds everything I need!",This SUV holds much more than I expected. Handles great in snow/ice. Big enough for three adults to sit comfortably in the back seat.
"07 12, 2017",Rock solid reliability!,"Solid, smooth engine. A little underpowered with the 4 cylinder and 4wd. The transmission is very smooth. It is awesome in snow and averages 22 mpg city. My only complaint would be the highway fuel mileage. Manufacturer claims 27 on highway. Best I've seen is 26, but usually average 24-25. I guess it's because it only a 4 speed transmission."
"07 12, 2017",Best car for the money,The nicest used car I've ever owned it rides and handles really sporty for being an suv I would recommend this car to anyone.
"07  9, 2017",Reliability is outstanding for all road conditions,"Well thought out vehicle for real life atmosphere that people encounter everyday. Suspension is great, very reliable and drives smooth. Wasn't a fan of Toyota. Now that I bought one. Very impressed with the performance that I see in the vehicle. 4x4 is great. Engineering in vehicle is well planned and would think it took the simplest thought of what you wished or wanted out of a vehicle.  Especially in bad weather or bad road conditions."
"07  8, 2017",Second of 2 Ravs.,"This vehicle meets all my needs. Great style, comfort and handling. Just the right size for our needs."
"06 15, 2017",Graduated to Rav 4 after 20 years in Sienns,My kids are all grown and I was ready for something fun and less mom. I found that in the Rav 4!! It's zippier than a minivan but still has the compact feel of a car. I love the look and drive but do wish the seats were a bit comfier.
"06  1, 2017",Nicest Upgrade in Several Years,"Was looking for an AWD SUV that would fit the short space available in my garage.  This RAV4 had almost all the options I sought, good cargo room, fair power (for a 4 cyl), and feels good in the driver's seat.  Front passenger seat not as comfortable because it doesn't have the height adjust like driver's.  Only had this car a couple weeks, so reliability rating is of previous Toyota experience.  Used to be a GM person, but Toyota and Honda both have both won me over from several of the recent GM I've worked on or driven."
"05 14, 2017",Kgorkin,Best vehicle I have owned.  No issues keep the maintenance up and it will run forever. Geat in the snow plenty of power. Thhe 3rd generation is the one to have. My wfe has a 2013 4th gen we like the old one better.
"05 10, 2017",Perfect Compact SUV,This is a great lil SUV. Holds 4 adults fairly comfortably and the one we have has all the options so that makes the ride even better.
"04  6, 2017",Reliable !,Very reliable with the plenty of power V6 option available. In the RAV4 sport that we own it has great power and great torque to do what we need to do and go where we need to go with the all wheel drive
"03 28, 2017",As expected and a little more,"Toyota has built a great reputation and I expected the RAV4 to follow suit. Luxury was not what I was looking for, but functionality. Visibility is great in this car, it has lots of room and has a lot more pep from its four cylinder than my '05 Escape with a V6. Trivial items like the floor shifter stem looks ""thin"", the ""headlights are on"" dash indicator light a little bright and the driver's seat seatbelt receptacle too low, but nothing of extreme annoyance. I enjoy driving this car."
"03 28, 2017",Great car for distance comfortable and good on gas,Toyota makes a great reliable car that has excellent gas mileage . The Toyota Rav 4 is great for travel and vacations. Lots of room for luggage and passengers. I would recommend this car to all my family and friends.
"03 28, 2017",RAV4 overview,Stylish and practical with good value for the money. Only drawback is the seats not comfortable enough.
"03 24, 2017",Another reliable Toyota,"I have owned numerous cars but my Toyota Sienna was by far the most reliable and cheapest vehicle to maintain. When I was in the market for a replacement vehicle I went right for the Toyota again only this time I don't need minivan as my kids are grown.
The Rav 4 drives lovely, is trying and has a lot of features that make driving comfortable and convenient!  So far I love everything about it and I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it like I did my Sienna."
"03 21, 2017",the word dependable and that no lie,I wake in the morning that all is good with  this rav4. they build convince in there cars and faith that is my the best for my family.
"03 15, 2017",Toyota Rav4 2011,Its a confort car and Smoth and is safe and thanks form the saler Juan Gamara for his excelent atention
"03 13, 2017",Great Value,"This car gets great gas millage, has good cargo capacity, and very reliable all for an affordable price."
"03  9, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"I just purchased this vehicle.  It was highly recommended to me.  It's comfort, performance, exterior styling, interior design all deserve a 5* rating, as well as value for the money and reliability.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"12 11, 2016",I love it,"This is my second RAV4 and I've loved them both! Good looking, smooth ride, lots of space. Toyota is reliable and I plan on driving this for a long time."
"11 24, 2016",2011 Rav 4,Always enjoyed this brand   Rav 4  is a good SUV style for a reasonable price and gas mileage.  I recommend to anyone looking to get out of a car and into something a little different
"01  8, 2016",Wilfredo Vega Best Sales Associate,"Thank you for everything, we appreciate everything that you have helped me with. I didn't have great credit but you managed a way for me to make it work! I have a great car thanks to Wilfredo Vega, sales and leasing consultant.

Thank you from Mr. and Mrs. Ventura"
"09  9, 2014",Reliable and comfortable,I purchased the car few months back and I have good experience. I am really enjoying the SUV drive. I like the pick up. Most of the times i have issues in the Cruise control speed adjusting sometimes it takes huge pickup suddenly kind of jerk. Everything is good but I see few things especially the suspension is not as good as it is. Rear Seats are comfortable only for two and if third person sits then it would be congested.
"03 28, 2014",Best Small SUV I've Owned!,"I've owned an Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Cherokee, and a Honda CRV. THis little gem is by far my favorite. I'm short, so the adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel are a huge plus for me. It handles like a dream and has a peppy pick-up. I have the leather package and sunroof, and it gives it a sporty feel.
It rains a lot in New Orleans, and our streets aren't the smoothest, which is why I drive SUVs. This little baby is a dream for these conditions. The back seat has ample leg room, and the controls are within easy reach. I love it."
"12  7, 2013",Everything I expected and more,"We recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 sport from Toyota of Manhattan and really love the car, and we also had a very pleasant experience with all of the staff at the dealership, very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and much to my surprise we are getting slightly better MPG than our other SUV that we traded in. I also have slightly more cargo space than I did before and the car is very comfortable and handles very well. I've owned many Toyotas and have never been disappointed with their products, it looks like we found another quality car that will serve us well for many years to come."
"11  1, 2013",Watch for paint issues,"I have paint coming off of the roof between the windshield and sunroof. I showed this to the dealer and they raised the issue to Toyota. Since the car has over the 36K miles warrantee I was simply told they don't care and it was not their problem. The car is less than 36 months old and because of my job I have to put on more miles. You will notice paint issues. The depth of paint varies on the roof from the rest of the car as measured at the dealership.
Realize that there is NO advantage to having a Toyota over any of the other manufacturers. The quality is not better nor is the service."
"06 30, 2013",Great smaller alternative to the Highlander,"I traded my highlander for the rav4. Yes, smaller and less room, but gas mileage, reliability, small easy to maneuver...worth the trade. Tough at first, I lived my highlander, but w gas priced and no longer needing the extra room, I'm very happy w the trade. Mine is the bade model e the ESV pkg...I.e. moonroof, bigger nicer rims and tires, 6 CDplayer. ONE BAD THING...huge for me,maybe not for you. The radio stinks!!! DDoesn't go anywhere near adas loud as my highlander. I'm learning to live w it. Oh yeah, I bought used and the person before added a Bluetooth. Love this!!! If you don't have one, get one. Worth every penny!!!"
"06 23, 2013",Quite happy with it!,It's only been a month since I got my used RAV4. So far I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to someone with a brain injury or with depth perception problems. After years in a lower car I feel I have better command of the road.
"06 19, 2013",good car,this is a good car for me and my freinds and family i only use it in the snowing months. with winter in this area . it has all wheal drive.
"04 17, 2013",Best and Safest car my daughter has ever had,"This 2011 RAV4 replaces a 2004 RAV4 with 166,000 miles that was in an accident and totalled, the 2004 was still in great shape and trouble free. This 2011 RAV4 is a phenomenal car, great value, great inside and outside styling, the 4 cylinder engine is economical and peppy, the 4 speed automatic transmission is smooth, the 4 wheel disc brakes stop great, the AWD system is flawless, seats are comfortable, the inside space is great, the comfort features are wonderful, this RAV4 has the Run Flat tires that ride a little harsh but convenient in case of a flat, the moon/sunroof is a treat and the multi-CD radio sounds great. If you're looking for a small AWD SUV, this is such a great choice, not the most luxurious but such a great value, I'll buy another RAV4 anytime without hesitation."
"01 26, 2013",Quality with power and excellent mileage.,"Smooth power, spacious, comfortable, and extremely well built. Handles well and easy to get into. Fully featured. Only wish it had 6 or 7 speed transmission which would probably help produce better gas mileage. Still satisfied with the mileage considering the horse power this car has. Would recomend to friends and family"
"12 25, 2012",Have to wait and see how it works..just bought it,Loooks good so far................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"08 14, 2012",BUTNING RAV4 SPORT,"Ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy, it?s not a family car. I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. It burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 2 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's not too bad. Now I just add oil every other month, after 4-recall I think I made a big mistake buying the RAV4."
"06 26, 2012",New Toyota rav 4Limited nice ride,"This limited Rav4 has leather moon roof power heated seats etc;I love the appearance,the ride and performance of this vehicle.I am glad I bought the v6 the engine it is smooth and quiet.The storng acceleration and performance is worth the extrta money. the gas mileage of mixed driving in hilly terrain is 23mpg. I am anxious to take it on A trip. I only have 1200 miles.The ext. is Blizzard Pearl,with tan leather and a tan pin stripe. The 4 cylinder performance was adequate , but not fun to drive like the v6."
"06  4, 2012",Nice suv,"Nice small SUV. Still gives the ""feel"" of a bigger and taller SUV, but compact...seems nearly as large inside as my 2003 Highlander."
"05 14, 2012",My 2011 Rav4 V6 sport,"After I purchased my 2011 Rav V6 sport there was a rattling noise coming from the moonroof that was horribly ruining my early ownership experience. Dealer kept the car three days and managed to replace the wind deflector but even with the new wind deflector on the noise was still there although not as loud as before. It's been one month and a half and I am realizing that the drive shaft whines considerably loud at low speeds(30-45 mph). I am definitely having that looked but the car had only 7300 miles on it when I bought it and it is bothering me to the point I would not consider buying used anymore. There is only one thing I will have to say that the V6 is strong and fast and that the car is pretty good looking too, compare to the competition. The fact that it is a Sport model and comes with tuned suspension makes the ride harsh and stiff. You may consider that prior to purchasing. Bottom line, Toyota lacks bells and whistles so if you are into technology, innovation, and interior quality, today's Rav4 does not offer anything exciting. Reliability has also dropped in my opinion since this is the second Rav I own. I am sorry but it is just a plain car that has lost its vision and more importantly has forgotten what sport really means."
"04 17, 2012",2011 Rav 4,"Excellent styling. The performance of the v-6 is also excellent. I've been driving on snow and ice. The ABS, 4WD, and the stock all weather 18"" tires work very well together."
"03 30, 2012",I love the 6 cyl. zip!,"I've owned the RAV4 for a year now & do daily commuting & the occasional long road trip. I wish the gas mileage was better, but I like the extra power of the V-6; it has a smooth ride & good handling. There are lots of extra features I enjoy (heated seats, 4WD, back up cam, sunroof) & the styling is reasonable but not flashy. A nice, solid vehicle."
"03  4, 2012",2011 RAV4 4cyl. 4x4 OK but disappointed,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. engine 4x4. This was purchased as my mom's golden years vehicle. She wanted something she could see out of, was up high/easy to get in and out of, small-ish and got good gas mileage. Also, all the bells and whistles my dad refused to get in the past, so she chose an almost fully loaded Limited model.

Went with 4 cylinder engine to maximize MPG, but my area is short on front wheel drive 'Limited' models, so ended up with the 4 wheel drive. At the time of purchase, Toyota.com said 2 wheel drive models were not available for sale in my area (Md.). I don't know if this was due to the tsunami or just a regular sales decision.

There is no hill-holder or hill brake on the automatic transmission in the 4 cylinder model, so when you start on a steep hill the car rolls back like a manual transmission car. Really unnerves my mom. She tries to avoid hills. I've heard the hill brake may be an option (?) you can purchase, but seeing as she bought a Limited version and it didn't come with it, I doubt it. Maybe the front wheel drive only version has it? The V-6 does have it. We didn't encounter any substantial hills on our test drives so it didn't appear to be as rolly as it really is on big hills.

The gas mileage is awful for old lady drivers. My mom's short 2-5 mile stop-sign racing at 25-35 mph speeds result in 16-17mpg. But, one trip over 10 miles on the highway will bump the average to over 20mpg, but still nowhere near the big print advertised mileage, much closer to the small low end fine print mileage for the V-6. The ""break in period"" is bogus. Did average 28-30 mpg on a long interstate trip, but we cared more about the around town mileage.

I am 6'3"" and I find the seats to be slightly off. Seat bottoms are not quite wide enough or long enough, but it's not my car. But, at least your almost level with your co-pilot versus the Subaru Forester where the co-pilot sits down in a hole with the dash board at eye level. Overall, you can't beat the room available in the RAV4. Very roomy front and back. Oh, we only got the 2 rows of seats.

As most everyone notes, the swing out tailgate is not great, but you can learn to work with it. Only thing you can't work around is when it's raining; you don't have any cover and the rain just goes right in the back.

Overall the RAV4 is a great vehicle. The 4 cylinder has a lot of pep. More than enough to get you moving. Ride is tops for the type of vehicle, but by no means smooth or sedan-like. Wind and road noise is quieter than CR-V, but not as quiet as a sedan. Speaking of the CR-V, the RAV4 doesn't have any strong vibrations through the steering wheel when stopped at a light like the CR-V. That was a bit unnerving on our CR-V test drives. You'd be sitting at a light and it would just vibrate your arms. I think it was tied to the power steering and A/C system. Anyways, one of the cons for the CR-V that led to the RAV4 purchase. The interior details are great in the RAV4: cup holders, outlets, folding seats, sliding seats, armrest and glove boxes. The only other thing I don't like are the LCD displays. They look dated and detract from the style of the interior. A quibble, but eh..."
"01 30, 2012",First time Toyota Suv,"Engine...(4 cyl) transmission a little noisy when accelerating. But has plenty of power for 4 cyl.

Looks....Clean and Sharp exterior, interior space is the most available in small Sub class. seats have been comfortable on trips and general driving.

Radio....I don't Like not as good sounding as I would have e
Xspected..

Price......base model $ 21,000

I would recommend this vehicle 4-5 stars."
"01  3, 2012",Disappointed,"We own a 2011 4 cylinder front wheel drive RAV-4. The gas milage is not as good as we expected. We get about 20 per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.
Three times in two months the SUV engine raced and jumped while we were backing up. Toyta kept the car for three days and could not reproduce the issue.
This is our third Toyota SUV and our last. Toyota SUV's are not as reliable as their sedans. Toyota SUV's are not woth the price!"
"01  2, 2012",just breaking it in,"I like the way the car handles, the gas mileage is up and down, I have owned it for two months now, I have 2000 miles on it. I have not gotten more then 23 MPG at the highest and 18 MPG lowest. I have not driven more then 100 miles at a stretch on the highway. I am hoping it works itself into better MPG. I don't like the light color of cloth on interior doors. It really shows dirt and stains easily . other then this, I really like the car. It is
4 cylinder 4wd. It has power, for a 4 cylinder."
"12 27, 2011","New 2011 RAV4, LIMITED, Experience","Purchased the LIMITED V6 4x4 in Pacific Blue fully loaded with the exception of navigation. Since I own a Garmin, no sense in having both. JBL + Bluetooth, leather, tint, tow + more! Don't drive a V6 because you will ultimately buy it! Very comfortable ride although thirsty in the city with around 17-18 mpg around town, which is not too bad. No long trips yet, but should get 22 + even with weight of 4x4 and engine. Interior is good, but would have liked some upgrade in materials, however nicely crafted and roomy. Towing will be easy with the tow package and powerful engine. Little to no changes in 2012. Buy at end of month for good deal. Used prices are high so I opted for new, since they hold their value well. Not cheap, but all the vehicle one would need for travel, sport, etc."
"12 26, 2011",2011 RAV4,Solid basic small SUV. No real frills but it is reliable. Averaging 25 MPG city and 26.5 highway. Only compliant-road noise.
"12 23, 2011",new to toyota,"After much research..alot done on cars.com, I went with the Rav 4...based on reviews and material that I read. So far I am very happy with my choice...the 4 cylinder impresses me with its power and ease..the vehicle feels safe and solid...my last SUV was a 2000 Explorer and this is far superior in every way."
"12 13, 2011",Great Machine,"Great car for the money. V-6 motor and transmission combination better than before. Leather and options definitely make the car more enjoyable. Still has the dopey dashboard and odd interior design choices, but lots of SUV for the money. Anything else is $3,000-$5,000 more for the power and options."
"12  6, 2011",Excellent ride,When shopping I drove every 4 cyl all wheel drive car on the market. Rav4 was my first ride and ended going back and buying. Excellent handling and gas milage isn't bad either. I would reccommend to any one looking for an all wheel drive vehicle
"11 17, 2011",MOST DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AROUND.,"I OWNED A TOYOTA CAMARY FROM 1989 UNTIL 1999 AND IT STILL WAS DEPENDABLE AT 200,000 MILES AND THE NEXT VEHICLE I BOUGHT WAS A TOYOTA RAV. 4, 1999 MODEL AND STILL OWN IT WITH 155,000 MILES AND IT STILL DRIVES GREAT. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS VEHICLE FOR COMFORT, RELIABILITY, GOOD LOOKING, SPACIOUS, AND KEEPS ON TICKING. LOVE TOYOTA"
"11 15, 2011",Just what I wanted,This is an excellent car. It's exactly what I was looking for. I go on a lot of road trips so I wanted 4 wheel drive and a lot of cargo room. This car definitely has both. It is very reliable and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
"10 17, 2011",The Do Everything Vehicle,"We have the 2011 V6 Limited version with most of the extras except the navigation tool. Great gas mileage, great response on the highway, turns on a dime and extremely responsive. From the outside it appears quite compact. I have taken 80"" doors in for repair, transported a 5' bathtub from Home Depot to our home. Taken grandkids on various trips, 4 golfers including myself with all our gear. Looks good, rides great, never a fear of it not performing as advertised when we purchased it."
"10  4, 2011",Rav4,"We drove the Rav to Austin, TX and back to Seattle roundtrip of over 6000 miles. The ride was comfortable and enjoyable!"
"09 27, 2011",Great car,"We bought the RAV4 4 wheel drive V6. Incredibly, it gets better mileage than my Honda CRV even though the RAV4 has far superior performance. It also has more cargo space and a quieter ride. THe radio is quite good.
THe only cons include an annoying squeak in the dashboard and the inferior tires that they equip the car with that we were warned would not last for too long. THe tires are Bridgestone Duelers.
This is one sweet ride and I expect it to handle our harsh winters well once we get better tires on it for winter driving.

One other con relates to the fact that the car which cost a considerable amount does not include floor mats which to me is shocking."
"08 26, 2011",First Toyota,"I have always owned Hondas and I love the look and the way the Toyota drives. It is sporty and I'm a not a Mini Van Mom driver anymore. I have the extra seats if I need to drive my kids friends. It gets great gas mileage, and so easy to get in and out of space?"
"08 21, 2011",Great Car,"In February 2011 I purchased a Toyota Rav4. So far I have been very pleased with the car except for two things 1) I cannot buckle the middle seat belt in the back seat. It has some sort of dual lock but even with the manual I can't see how it works. I think something is wrong with it. I am going to have to contact the dealer because no one I know can figure it out. Since we have the optional third row we have never needed to use that buckle yet. 2) I am not happy with the car doors, especially the back seat doors. You have to really slam them to get them to close tight on the first try and when they close (this applies to all the doors) it sounds like a tin can. The sound makes the car seem really cheap. If pressed to list any and all complaints I guess I would have to say that I dislike clock and the placement it, it makes the interior of the car look very dated to me. Although after having the car for a month or so I was completely used to it. Other than these few minor things (I will contact the dealer to fix or explain the seat belt) I really love the car. It has a nice smooth ride and so far it has been great."
"07 29, 2011",Exactly what I was looking for.,"I needed a family car with cargo room that still had some sportiness to it. The 2011 Rav4 met all of my needs, and made letting go of my beloved (and still running great) '99 Honda Prelude palatable."
"07 28, 2011",Affordible SUV,"Satisfied but new models should have:
1. six speed trans,
2. better seats with wider backs
3. better tires
4. Get better MPG"
"07 21, 2011",2011 Rav 4,An ok car but a little light on the bells and whistles for the money. Runs ok but a little rough compared to other small SUVs.
"07  8, 2011",Good Car,"It is a good car. I liked the third row seats. I can used it when I need. Otherwise, I can fold them down. I installed a navigation from Toyoter Service. I don't like the installed Navigation. It has some problems. Perhaps, Toyota's factory installed navigation is better."
"06  2, 2011",NICE CAR,"NICE SIZE SUV, HAS EVERY THING YOU WOULD NEED FOR COMFORT AND RIDE. HAS GOOD STYLING FOR ITS SIZE. VERY COMPETIVE IN ITS SIZE"
"05 30, 2011",Fall In Love again,"Love LOve LOVe LOVE this little suv! I am the mom of three grown boys(two still in college),when I get in my Rav4 and head down the road I feel 16 again. This car does anything I ask it to do. The only thing I can really complain about and it's very minor, when I close the door it sounds a little tinnie. It is a 4 cylinder front wheel drive and it has plenty of get up and go. I am very happy with my purchase just ask my kids. My three favorite things about my car are keyless entry, keyless start and the sunroof. I would highly recommend you give the Rav4 a try you just might fall in love again."
"05 27, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"Last car owned 2001 RAV4

Negatives: Stripping along side of car to prevent
other car doors damaging, is much,
much smaller and not well placed.

Gear shifting is complicated by manufac-
turer trying to give some semblence to a
standard transmission. Writer's first car
was a standard transmission.

Interior arrangement and seemingly un-
necessary placement of some operative
instrument are confusing. Once again,
the manufacturer is reaching out in des-
peration to make the newest model dif-
ferent. Too bad, the first few years the
models changed little if at all. It all be-
gan when they extended the body 14"",
playing havoc with the MPG and making
it difficult to park in a two car garage.

Toyota. You really going to print this?"
"05 20, 2011",Versatile and Fun,"Bought new 4x4 Limited with v6 in 2009. Have 43,000 miles on car. This is the best car I have ever owned and am still waiting for something to break!
Lightning fast, steady and quiet at 75mph, and great breaking. 26mpg at 75. 31mpg at 60mph.
I tow a small boat easily.
Seat are comfortable, back seat roomy, and storage a plenty. I like the spare outside to gain the interior room.
I also like the swing out rear door because I no longer hit my head on old mini van rear door.
JBL Sound system, blue tooth, sirius radio, and i pod plug in all work great."
"05 16, 2011",A very good car,"A fund car to drive and very peppy for a four cylinder
Model.a little less economy than advertise but still
Efficient."
"05 11, 2011",Greatest value for the money.,"I purchased the Sport model. It came with lots of extras including a six cylinder engine. The salesperson told me that the difference in gas mileage between the four cylinder and six cylinder engine is only one mile per gallon. I am impressed by the roominess inside. The height, width and depth of the driver's seat suits me perfectly. The steering wheel is adjustible as to the angle and space from the dash. The combination of ample room and adjustibility is perfect for driver comfort.

The six cylinder engine and four speed transmission results in responsive and smooth acceleration for interstate access. The cargo area is spacious and the flattening of the 2nd row seats is easy and can be controlled from the rear of the car.

I also appreciate the quiet cabin. Very little, if any, road or wind noise. The video screen that appears in the rear view mirror makes for safer backing than just the mirrors. All in all, I have no complaints and find it difficult to think of a single problem with this car."
"05  5, 2011",Perfect for me and grandkids,"I have the seven passenger Rav 4 and it is perfect for hauling my grandchildren around in, as three in car seats and one on the way to be in car seat, so had to have room, but yet wanted good gas mileage and this vehicle was exactly what I was looking for."
"04 30, 2011",Limited V-6 4WD,"Short front seats leads to backache & fatigue even on short trips on 5'9"" driver. Power tilt on driver side does not angle high enough at front of seat. V-6 jumpy on throttle from a stop. Limited rides stiffly over bumps and road reflectors. Versatile sliding, folding, reclining rear seat. Rear seat pull downs from the hatch area are useful. Navigation system is poor and couldn't get the JBL radio with the Nav. Oil change surprise on V-6 since the oil filter is paper and the filter itself costs $35-$50! After living with it, no longer satisfied."
"04 27, 2011","Comfortable, sporty, all around great","We were looking for a car that you could get in and out of easily (sits up higher) and this was the ticket! Also it is roomy without being extremely big.
Feels good from every aspect.
Very pleased."
"04 26, 2011",Great Car,"The V6 Rav4 is a great car - fast, fun to drive, easy to maneuver. The MP3 changer is great. I wish the steering mounted controls were standard on every trim - but it can be added afterwards without much trouble (people on RAV4 forums have done this). Mine has the 3rd row seats. They are small but usable for short trips around town. Only dislike on styling is the rear mounted spare tire - wish it were hidden like the CR-V."
"04 23, 2011",2011 RAV4 V6 4WD vs 2009 CRV EX AWD,"I traded in my 2009 Honda CR-V, EX, AWD on the 2011 Toyota RAV4, Limited, V6, 4WD. Both were bought new by me.
CRV Pros:
Better exterior looks.
Better seating comfort.
Lift hatchback rear door.
Feels like it has more interior room than RAV4.
CRV Cons:
Severely under powered for even routine driving.
RAV4 V6 Pros:
GREAT power!
Almost the same fuel milage as the 4 cyl CRV.
Twice the towing capacity.
Ability to lock in the 4WD manually (not available on CRV).
Climate control.
Full-size spare.
RAV4 V6 Cons:
The side opening rear door sucks!
The back seat is not sized for adults. The back rest height barely comes up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Definitely not sized for anything more than small children.
Very dated orange-yellow back lighting as opposed to the modern looking blue in the CRV.

For me, the three selling points for the RAV4 are the fantastic V6 with it's great power and MPG. The ability to manually lock-in the 4WD. And, it can tow more than the CRV.
I WOULD NOT buy the CRV because of the ridiculously under powered nature of the engine. It is horrible! However, if the CRV was available with the V6 similar to the RAV4 I would unquestionably buy the CRV over the RAV4.
I hope this helps someone considering the two SUVs."
"04  5, 2011",Very reliable car,"Big change from my old 2003 Rav4. Ride has improved and road noise is greatly reduced.
V6 engine runs smooth and much more power than the 4 cyl. engine."
"03 31, 2011",Best 4wd vehicle I have ever owned!,"Drives like a car while performing like an SUV. Simple, sturdy and reliable with a superb blend of attributes."
"03 27, 2011",merced toyota is the best,The RAV4 is a very different type of vehicle than the sedans and coupes previously owned. The RAV4 has great forward visibility. It feels bigger than it looks. The base model features are good.
"03 25, 2011",2011 RAV 4 review,"My second RAV4, a number of enhancements have been made on my LTD model since the 2007 model year I previously owned. The V6 is a great engine but my previous RAV had an annoying whine at 60 to 65 mph. Improvements in the electronically controlled transmission software have made the 2011 whisper quiet at these speeds. The smart key entry system works flawlessly and is great when you've got armfuls of stuff and can't fish the key out of your pocket. It even works when I'm wearing gloves. Zero squeaks or rattles, even in cold weather. V6 combined mileage has been in the 24 to 26 range, really good for a V6 4WD. Poor weather handling has been excellent, very stable on bad roads. No regrets in buying another one."
"03 22, 2011",Great Car,I had a Rav4 as a rental & decided to buy one. Best car I've ever owned & a good sized SUV for the city.
"03 22, 2011",Great in Snow & Ice,RAV4 handles well in the poorest of road conditions. Gives the driver the confidence in the cars ability to get you to your destination. Wind noise with rear windows cracked or open is quite annoying. Standard drivers seat can get uncomfortable. Rear window seems to get dirty quite easily. GREAT forward visability!
"03 14, 2011",Great car,"We recently sold our 2002 4Runner and bought a 2011 RAV4 sport. We look the outside and the intrerior is very well designed. The seats are comfortable and the interior has ample room for everything we need to fit, including the 2 car seats we'll be putting in later this year when our twins arrive. Ample power as the 179 hp is only slightly less than the '02 4Runner V6. It sips gas for an SUV."
"03 12, 2011",RAV4 Then and Now 2002-2011,Owned a 2002 RAV4 before buying this 2011 version. The new model is around 20% bigger and this change has more of an impact than I thought it would. On the plus side there is a lot more cargo room with or without the back seats folded down (I did not get the third row seat version) and more head room for taller passengers. On the minus side this is now a mid to large SUV so no more squeezing into the only tight parking spot left. I miss the ability I had with my 2002 version of taking out the rear seats for more cargo room and better gas mileage. However with the 2011 you get an extra glove box shelf and a variety of driver seat adjustments. Over all I like the new car and like anything new it takes some getting used to.
"03  8, 2011",the best,I am completely satisfied with the Rav SPORT model for 2011 Styling and comfort as well as satellite radio -best Toyota I have ever owned.
"03  5, 2011",2011 Toyota RAV4,"I love the car so far. It's quiet yet responsive. I have driven it in the snow and heavy rain. The Interiers are easy to use and all needed. Handling is great.

However, shouldn't the XM radio subscription come free with the deal, rather than just 3 months?"
"03  5, 2011",Great vehicle,I have the v6 model and it has great power along with shure footed in snow. Lots of room inside and a comfortable ride.
"03  1, 2011",the car that exceeded my expectations,"I wanted a compact SUV that gets good gas mileage,has a third row seat for my kids and comes in red!Did my research and came up with the RAV4 that I've been eyeing for a couple years already for its looks. We found one in a neighboring state and picked it up without even test driving it.No regrets as the Limited V6 has awesome acceleration!Talk about zoom,zoom!I live in Reno and its been great in the snow.My fellow musicians are in awe of the JBL speakers too."
"02 22, 2011",Glad I bought it!,"I bought this vehicle just as the snows descended on New England. I couldn't get this car to slip or slide! The V6 has ample horsepower, tranny shifts smoothly, butter-soft acceleration. I hope to keep it a very long time..."
"01 29, 2011",Bumpy ride,This SUV does not have the smoothest ride. You feel every bump on the road. It makes me wish I bought a regular car for a better ride. I wouldn't buy another one. I should have checked out the Honda's.
"12 30, 2010",I LOVE my new Rav4,"After 14 years as a Camry owner, I am a real Toyota believer. Even with the bad publicity Toyota endured earlier in 2010, I was not swayed from their product lines. However, I did want to sit up higher and have more visibility, so I decided to check out the Rav4 Limited, and I can't be happier with my decision. For once, I did not stint on the options, and already I am loving the heated leather seats (the cold winter in NYC so far has allowed me to really appreciate them) and the stereo system is fantastic. But the ride is the best - smooth, powerful, and pretty economical on the gas (though a bit less than the Camry, its true). I love the styling both outside and in, and feel I am a king in my new car."
"12  6, 2010",Rav4 for Mom,Mom loves it. Not the car for me but for her it is perfect. She lives in Colorado and it works great in the snow.
"12 30, 2023",Great value in a dependable fun used car,"We bought a 2011 AWD base model for our daughter just as the pandemic was starting. Three years later it has 120,000 miles on it and runs flawlessly. I just put on new shocks and struts and it rides like new. The driver side front axle seal needed replacement. The V6 has power to spare even in the mountain west, and makes it fun to drive. It's now worth a bit more than we paid for it."
"11  4, 2023",Still runs great!,"This is the best, most reliable car I have ever owned. Other than seals on the rear differential, I have done nothing to the car, other than brakes and routine maintenance. We have 157000 miles on it and it runs like new."
"11 23, 2022",2011 Toyota rav 4,I bought this vehicle used. Grinds when you go 30 miles an hour I want to know if there is recalls on vehicle and how to get them
"06 13, 2021",Best vehicle I have ever owned,"It is spacious, very comfortable more especially long distance. 
I still prefer this model in terms of looks as opposed to new models.
It is very low maintenance. I just love it"
"05 13, 2021","I love this car, so much!","This car, “Angel” is her name, is such a wonderful car, I just love it so much. I purchased it from a previous owner who had purchased it brand new when it came out but only drove it from home to a train station parking lot and then back home, the entire time. It had about 60k  miles on it and was in stellar condition. I just had to buy all new tires and just replaced the battery, last month. 

When I bought it in 2020, I was elated to have just found such a grand deal and my word, it has lived up to my expectations and then some. It’s so easy to drive. It is very comfortable, inside, the trunk and storage room back there is ample and with optimal care ( I take great care of this car, no slacking) it runs like a dream. 

Gas mileage is pretty good. I use ‘Plus’ gas in it. During a recent drive from Jersey to SC and back,  I filled up approx. every 4 hours at 1/4 tank left but yeah, I drove and opened that baby up like she’s never seen and quite frankly, it feels like it drives even better now, after that trip.

I love this car. It’s just big enough for me and stylishly speaking, it’s super cute. The only thing is that I’m a ‘sunroof’ person. My very first car had a sunroof and I’ve loved them ever since but I get enough sun and light through all of this cars windows so, well, that’s my only wish. 

Anyway, did I say ‘I love this car’, already? She is a dreamboat and I will drive her and care for her until she takes her last trek and breath :)
Adventure; we’ve got a lot to get into."
"01  7, 2021",Wouldn’t want any other car to be my first!,"The performance on this car is fantastic, from great gas miles and the smooth V6 engine, this car is runs great. Comfortable interior, very spacious and you don’t feel every bump in the road. Extra under storage in the trunk is so convenient. Feels very safe to be in as well. Only issue is back seat tracks are rusted from previous owner not cleaning water from a storm of the metal properly after leaving windows open, so they squeak when going over bumps. Other than that, I love my Rav4!"
"12 12, 2020",Great driving vehicle!,The RAV4 drives excellent! I now own 4 Toyotas! I absolutely love them! This is my first RAV4. It drives great and handles even better!
"11  9, 2020","I've enjoyed my RAV4, it takes me where I want","It is attractive, reliable, handles well and has never failed me.  I like the wheel on the back because I can find it in the parking lot"
"06 22, 2020",Spacious for a compact.,"Very impressed with the turning radius and the ease at which the engine tackles hills and speed. Very comfortable, and the air works very well. The back has plenty of room to pack my stuff. I do wish this vehicle had a tire on the back like the 12 that I saw, but that might just be an optional feature."
"06 12, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever had.,"My car has made me feel safe when I'm driving anywhere, especially in the winter times. When I decide to buy another car it will be a Toyota."
"06  8, 2020",Dependable and good all around.,"This car has a strong V6, good fuel economy, decent comfort and durability, and looks good.  Radio interface is far outdated but JBL speakers sound great.  Shock boots tear and lead to some squeaking but no major issues.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
"06  1, 2020",21 MPG city 28 MPG highway,"4th Toyota RAV I owned over the years, fully loaded & detailed! Best SUV on the road, safety, durability & lasting! I have 2019 & 2020 also. Never uses a drop of oil between changes."
"04 26, 2020",Excellent vehicle,"One of the best vehicles for Midwest, with AWD option it is same good for    highway, off road or winter driving. With 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine has a very good gas mileage."
"03 15, 2020",I love this car.,"This isn't the fanciest car in the world, but it is perfect for me. It is easy to park and is peppy enough to merge into traffic, and easy to get in and out of and there is lots of space for dogs, shopping, and all the crap I haul around. And, it gets decent gas milage. My favorite thing is the good visibility I have when driving."
"03  9, 2020",Always wanted SUV,I love this vehicle comfortable  spaces drives nice  I loved the color handles very nice  I have that have owned more  then one they always Owned Rav 4

"02  2, 2020",Drove for 60k miles and its great!,"Great car for all weather and terrains. Even with the base model, the capabilities of this car are still great almost ten years later. Drives great and have never had issues with traction in winter or on wet roads. Cheap to maintain and handles great!"
"12 25, 2019",Smooth ride and reliable,Blue tooth ready has 3rd row seating lots of leg room heated seats push button engine start roomy cargo area great for hauling lumber supplies
"12 11, 2019",My 1st car I have ever owned,"This Rav4 car did everything it was asked of and more by my family, my friends, And I. This car has more than enough room to carry a full-size double refrigerator or eight people. It great on gas mileage as well"
"11 24, 2019",Like a Timex,"4 wheel drive a major plus. Just 7 "" ground clearance, but it isn't a Wrangler.

Interior lights are TOO DIM. Have a flashlight handy. 

Good milage, easy maintenance."
"11  9, 2019",Very cheap on gas and comfortable driving.,The car has a lot of room and easy on gas. Very reliable and no issues with the car. Just Keep it maintained and will last long.
"09 14, 2019",Seems reliable but not impressed,"After 8 years, only 57000 miles, several recalls, local Toyota dealer refused to service vehicle or provide warranty recalls after purchase,  dealer refused to provide oil changes per contract and national Toyota advertisement - told me they did not realize it was expensive 0W-20 synthetic oil ( this was in 2011), Bluetooth is calls only, front cup holders do not hold taller cups, drives like go-cart  (steering is very sensitive), rough noisy  ride, things are glitchy - Bluetooth sometimes go out, back up camera sometimes goes out but mine is NOT included in the national recall, front left window makes loud cracking noise when going up, seats front and rear are not comfortable, front windshield has been replaced 3 times in 3 years - prone to damage,  original tires were the worst replaced at 25,000 miles,  difficulty getting replacement parts,  cowel on rear wheels sticks out 1/2"" and gets pitted by rocks - looks bad.  I do not want another Toyota."
"09 13, 2019",A great car at a great price.,"Comfortable, fun, and Toyota reliability. Very spacious for a small SUV.  Easy to maintain, and handles great. A great car for the price, I could not recommend it more."

"04 26, 2019",It has been very reliable so far.,This car has met all my expectations. Love the way it handles the road. The ride is great compare to all cars I tested.  Still looks good for being a used car.
"04 18, 2019",Love my car. Hate constant dash lights,"For last five  years, my dashboard on my 2011 Toyota RAV 4 has had check engine, four wheel drive, and traction control lights on. At inspection time, we spend $95 for a machine to tell us that the O2 sensor needs replacing and $80 for a new sensor. 19 to 20 miles after we get the sticker, the dash lights come back on and stay that way for another year. We just paid $80 for a different sensor before going to get a sticker and lights didn’t stay off long enough to get to a garage to get inspected. Called Downeast Toyota in Brewer where we bought the car and it will cost another $95 to have the diagnostic machine tell us the same thing again. Fed up is the least of my feelings."
"02  5, 2019",Back To Toyota For Reliability,"A sporty little ride. Basic and no-frills, but gets from Point A to Point B. Good on gas, and with some snow tires added will go where I need to go."
"01  9, 2019",Best Car Purchase in Years,I am very happy with this car.  It has the distinct body styling I prefer and has handled well even in the ice and snow.  I find it easy to drive and reminds me of my classic 1999 Honda CRV (which I would clone if I could).
"12 16, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"Excellent car but 2 main issues one the AC not good , and two the breaks keeps tearing off fast and not that strong as Nissan but have no idea about other Toyota models but over all Toyota cars n trucks are 100% reliable and re selling value cars"

"11 26, 2018",A Good Buy for the Money,"I purchased the Rav 4 because (1) it is a Toyota and (2) it has low mileage for a 2011 vehicle 26,000 miles). I wanted a small SUV with low mileage, a great reputation for reliability, a full size spare tire, 4 wheel drive, , attractiveness, and fuel economy.  I was actually looking for a V6 but settled for a 4 cylinder (2.5 liter) since I would get better fuel economy."
"11 22, 2018","Bought new . Now rav has 45,000 mi. Never failed .","In 45,000 miles the rav has never failed to get me where I was going . Last month my city had a flood .

I am loyal to Toyota rav4"
"04 29, 2018",First AWD I've owned,This car is great. The AWD also has the 4 wheel lock so I can feel confident getting out in the rain and snow. I live a mile from a blacktop road so this gives me peace of mind. The RAV4 has plenty of room for passengers as well as a cargo area. The seats are comfortable and there's a lot of legroom. With multiple storage compartments there's no cramming everything into a single glove box. The car is easy to get in and out of which is really nice when I'm feeling my age. I love the side opening rear door instead of a hatchback.
"04  7, 2018",very reliable and sturdy,"bought it for my twins got them through high school and college and never let us down.

"09 18, 2017",Loved everything about this car!,"I needed a car with plenty of leg room in the back seat. Rav 4 has it!  It is super clean, super comfortable, rides great....I can't say enough about this car.  I think it was meant for me to own."
"09  8, 2017",First comfortable car I've owned,I looked at many vehicles and this was the only one that fit me good.  As a short person I am able to put the seat up enough to reach the pedals without feeling to close to the steering wheel and after breaking my back this SUV is very comfortable.  I love all the features it comes with.  I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends.
"09  7, 2017",Nice car,"Great little SUV.  27 mpg+, quiet, loads of interior space.  Tailgate mounted swinging spare tire is a drawback."
"09  7, 2017",Best SUV,I've owned a couple of older RAV4's and absolutely love them!  You can't beat Toyota for reliability and performance. If I had to pick only one all around car to own it would an older model RAV.
"09  6, 2017",great price   good value,"I Love this car       Great in the snow and bad weather .   Superb power yet great fuel economy, huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height,,,comfortable ride"
"08 18, 2017","Great value, very dependable!","Best money I have ever spent. I have driven this car 140,000 miles in 5 years and only have had to replace brakes, tires and oil! The V6 is very strong and efficient."
"08 17, 2017",Smooth stylish ride!,"I absolutely love my Toyota Rav4 it's comfortable for my whole family and drives smoothly and quietly! You do have to be careful with the transmission fluid if it's low or too full it will shift a little rough from reverse to drive but if you have just the right amount it is smooth as can be. I was very surprised by the trunk space for this smaller suv but having the spare tire on the tailgate makes all the difference, I am excited to play with this car in the snow and se how it does!"
"08  6, 2017",very reliable,Fun to drive. I feel safe and comfortable.  It is easy to dive. I have no blind spots.  Good ac and stereo.
"08  4, 2017",Love love love my RAV 4,"I own two Toyota RAV4 4's, a 2011 and a 2009. They are both work horses. V6 gives me the power to tow, and enough torque to quickly accelerate onto the highway. I was not a fan of the newer 4 cylinder versions so I have purchased two of the older V6 (no longer produced).  One of these was purchased due to storage room in the back end for my son that is a Hockey Goalie and he hauls a lot of large gear."
"08  2, 2017","Comfort, style, economy","Love my used RAV4! So comfortable and stylish, roomy and great on gas! Plenty of room and easy to drive. And so many extra touches!"
"08  1, 2017",A very dependable utility buggy,This is a great car - SUV- or whatever you want to call it. It's very dependable and useful. The cargo area is deceptively large when the back seat is folded down. I've been able to carry a small couch in there. I also got a double bed to fit one day. This is a super useful vehicle.
"07 18, 2017","Sporty, great handling, holds everything I need!",This SUV holds much more than I expected. Handles great in snow/ice. Big enough for three adults to sit comfortably in the back seat.
"07 12, 2017",Rock solid reliability!,"Solid, smooth engine. A little underpowered with the 4 cylinder and 4wd. The transmission is very smooth. It is awesome in snow and averages 22 mpg city. My only complaint would be the highway fuel mileage. Manufacturer claims 27 on highway. Best I've seen is 26, but usually average 24-25. I guess it's because it only a 4 speed transmission."
"07 12, 2017",Best car for the money,The nicest used car I've ever owned it rides and handles really sporty for being an suv I would recommend this car to anyone.
"07  9, 2017",Reliability is outstanding for all road conditions,"Well thought out vehicle for real life atmosphere that people encounter everyday. Suspension is great, very reliable and drives smooth. Wasn't a fan of Toyota. Now that I bought one. Very impressed with the performance that I see in the vehicle. 4x4 is great. Engineering in vehicle is well planned and would think it took the simplest thought of what you wished or wanted out of a vehicle.  Especially in bad weather or bad road conditions."
"07  8, 2017",Second of 2 Ravs.,"This vehicle meets all my needs. Great style, comfort and handling. Just the right size for our needs."
"06 15, 2017",Graduated to Rav 4 after 20 years in Sienns,My kids are all grown and I was ready for something fun and less mom. I found that in the Rav 4!! It's zippier than a minivan but still has the compact feel of a car. I love the look and drive but do wish the seats were a bit comfier.
"06  1, 2017",Nicest Upgrade in Several Years,"Was looking for an AWD SUV that would fit the short space available in my garage.  This RAV4 had almost all the options I sought, good cargo room, fair power (for a 4 cyl), and feels good in the driver's seat.  Front passenger seat not as comfortable because it doesn't have the height adjust like driver's.  Only had this car a couple weeks, so reliability rating is of previous Toyota experience.  Used to be a GM person, but Toyota and Honda both have both won me over from several of the recent GM I've worked on or driven."
"05 14, 2017",Kgorkin,Best vehicle I have owned.  No issues keep the maintenance up and it will run forever. Geat in the snow plenty of power. Thhe 3rd generation is the one to have. My wfe has a 2013 4th gen we like the old one better.
"05 10, 2017",Perfect Compact SUV,This is a great lil SUV. Holds 4 adults fairly comfortably and the one we have has all the options so that makes the ride even better.
"04  6, 2017",Reliable !,Very reliable with the plenty of power V6 option available. In the RAV4 sport that we own it has great power and great torque to do what we need to do and go where we need to go with the all wheel drive
"03 28, 2017",As expected and a little more,"Toyota has built a great reputation and I expected the RAV4 to follow suit. Luxury was not what I was looking for, but functionality. Visibility is great in this car, it has lots of room and has a lot more pep from its four cylinder than my '05 Escape with a V6. Trivial items like the floor shifter stem looks ""thin"", the ""headlights are on"" dash indicator light a little bright and the driver's seat seatbelt receptacle too low, but nothing of extreme annoyance. I enjoy driving this car."
"03 28, 2017",Great car for distance comfortable and good on gas,Toyota makes a great reliable car that has excellent gas mileage . The Toyota Rav 4 is great for travel and vacations. Lots of room for luggage and passengers. I would recommend this car to all my family and friends.
"03 28, 2017",RAV4 overview,Stylish and practical with good value for the money. Only drawback is the seats not comfortable enough.
"03 24, 2017",Another reliable Toyota,"I have owned numerous cars but my Toyota Sienna was by far the most reliable and cheapest vehicle to maintain. When I was in the market for a replacement vehicle I went right for the Toyota again only this time I don't need minivan as my kids are grown.
The Rav 4 drives lovely, is trying and has a lot of features that make driving comfortable and convenient!  So far I love everything about it and I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it like I did my Sienna."
"03 21, 2017",the word dependable and that no lie,I wake in the morning that all is good with  this rav4. they build convince in there cars and faith that is my the best for my family.
"03 15, 2017",Toyota Rav4 2011,Its a confort car and Smoth and is safe and thanks form the saler Juan Gamara for his excelent atention
"03 13, 2017",Great Value,"This car gets great gas millage, has good cargo capacity, and very reliable all for an affordable price."
"03  9, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"I just purchased this vehicle.  It was highly recommended to me.  It's comfort, performance, exterior styling, interior design all deserve a 5* rating, as well as value for the money and reliability.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"12 11, 2016",I love it,"This is my second RAV4 and I've loved them both! Good looking, smooth ride, lots of space. Toyota is reliable and I plan on driving this for a long time."
"11 24, 2016",2011 Rav 4,Always enjoyed this brand   Rav 4  is a good SUV style for a reasonable price and gas mileage.  I recommend to anyone looking to get out of a car and into something a little different
"01  8, 2016",Wilfredo Vega Best Sales Associate,"Thank you for everything, we appreciate everything that you have helped me with. I didn't have great credit but you managed a way for me to make it work! I have a great car thanks to Wilfredo Vega, sales and leasing consultant.

Thank you from Mr. and Mrs. Ventura"
"09  9, 2014",Reliable and comfortable,I purchased the car few months back and I have good experience. I am really enjoying the SUV drive. I like the pick up. Most of the times i have issues in the Cruise control speed adjusting sometimes it takes huge pickup suddenly kind of jerk. Everything is good but I see few things especially the suspension is not as good as it is. Rear Seats are comfortable only for two and if third person sits then it would be congested.
"03 28, 2014",Best Small SUV I've Owned!,"I've owned an Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Cherokee, and a Honda CRV. THis little gem is by far my favorite. I'm short, so the adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel are a huge plus for me. It handles like a dream and has a peppy pick-up. I have the leather package and sunroof, and it gives it a sporty feel.
It rains a lot in New Orleans, and our streets aren't the smoothest, which is why I drive SUVs. This little baby is a dream for these conditions. The back seat has ample leg room, and the controls are within easy reach. I love it."
"12  7, 2013",Everything I expected and more,"We recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 sport from Toyota of Manhattan and really love the car, and we also had a very pleasant experience with all of the staff at the dealership, very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and much to my surprise we are getting slightly better MPG than our other SUV that we traded in. I also have slightly more cargo space than I did before and the car is very comfortable and handles very well. I've owned many Toyotas and have never been disappointed with their products, it looks like we found another quality car that will serve us well for many years to come."
"11  1, 2013",Watch for paint issues,"I have paint coming off of the roof between the windshield and sunroof. I showed this to the dealer and they raised the issue to Toyota. Since the car has over the 36K miles warrantee I was simply told they don't care and it was not their problem. The car is less than 36 months old and because of my job I have to put on more miles. You will notice paint issues. The depth of paint varies on the roof from the rest of the car as measured at the dealership.
Realize that there is NO advantage to having a Toyota over any of the other manufacturers. The quality is not better nor is the service."
"06 30, 2013",Great smaller alternative to the Highlander,"I traded my highlander for the rav4. Yes, smaller and less room, but gas mileage, reliability, small easy to maneuver...worth the trade. Tough at first, I lived my highlander, but w gas priced and no longer needing the extra room, I'm very happy w the trade. Mine is the bade model e the ESV pkg...I.e. moonroof, bigger nicer rims and tires, 6 CDplayer. ONE BAD THING...huge for me,maybe not for you. The radio stinks!!! DDoesn't go anywhere near adas loud as my highlander. I'm learning to live w it. Oh yeah, I bought used and the person before added a Bluetooth. Love this!!! If you don't have one, get one. Worth every penny!!!"
"06 23, 2013",Quite happy with it!,It's only been a month since I got my used RAV4. So far I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to someone with a brain injury or with depth perception problems. After years in a lower car I feel I have better command of the road.
"06 19, 2013",good car,this is a good car for me and my freinds and family i only use it in the snowing months. with winter in this area . it has all wheal drive.
"04 17, 2013",Best and Safest car my daughter has ever had,"This 2011 RAV4 replaces a 2004 RAV4 with 166,000 miles that was in an accident and totalled, the 2004 was still in great shape and trouble free. This 2011 RAV4 is a phenomenal car, great value, great inside and outside styling, the 4 cylinder engine is economical and peppy, the 4 speed automatic transmission is smooth, the 4 wheel disc brakes stop great, the AWD system is flawless, seats are comfortable, the inside space is great, the comfort features are wonderful, this RAV4 has the Run Flat tires that ride a little harsh but convenient in case of a flat, the moon/sunroof is a treat and the multi-CD radio sounds great. If you're looking for a small AWD SUV, this is such a great choice, not the most luxurious but such a great value, I'll buy another RAV4 anytime without hesitation."
"01 26, 2013",Quality with power and excellent mileage.,"Smooth power, spacious, comfortable, and extremely well built. Handles well and easy to get into. Fully featured. Only wish it had 6 or 7 speed transmission which would probably help produce better gas mileage. Still satisfied with the mileage considering the horse power this car has. Would recomend to friends and family"
"12 25, 2012",Have to wait and see how it works..just bought it,Loooks good so far................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"08 14, 2012",BUTNING RAV4 SPORT,"Ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy, it?s not a family car. I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. It burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 2 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's not too bad. Now I just add oil every other month, after 4-recall I think I made a big mistake buying the RAV4."
"06 26, 2012",New Toyota rav 4Limited nice ride,"This limited Rav4 has leather moon roof power heated seats etc;I love the appearance,the ride and performance of this vehicle.I am glad I bought the v6 the engine it is smooth and quiet.The storng acceleration and performance is worth the extrta money. the gas mileage of mixed driving in hilly terrain is 23mpg. I am anxious to take it on A trip. I only have 1200 miles.The ext. is Blizzard Pearl,with tan leather and a tan pin stripe. The 4 cylinder performance was adequate , but not fun to drive like the v6."
"06  4, 2012",Nice suv,"Nice small SUV. Still gives the ""feel"" of a bigger and taller SUV, but compact...seems nearly as large inside as my 2003 Highlander."
"05 14, 2012",My 2011 Rav4 V6 sport,"After I purchased my 2011 Rav V6 sport there was a rattling noise coming from the moonroof that was horribly ruining my early ownership experience. Dealer kept the car three days and managed to replace the wind deflector but even with the new wind deflector on the noise was still there although not as loud as before. It's been one month and a half and I am realizing that the drive shaft whines considerably loud at low speeds(30-45 mph). I am definitely having that looked but the car had only 7300 miles on it when I bought it and it is bothering me to the point I would not consider buying used anymore. There is only one thing I will have to say that the V6 is strong and fast and that the car is pretty good looking too, compare to the competition. The fact that it is a Sport model and comes with tuned suspension makes the ride harsh and stiff. You may consider that prior to purchasing. Bottom line, Toyota lacks bells and whistles so if you are into technology, innovation, and interior quality, today's Rav4 does not offer anything exciting. Reliability has also dropped in my opinion since this is the second Rav I own. I am sorry but it is just a plain car that has lost its vision and more importantly has forgotten what sport really means."
"04 17, 2012",2011 Rav 4,"Excellent styling. The performance of the v-6 is also excellent. I've been driving on snow and ice. The ABS, 4WD, and the stock all weather 18"" tires work very well together."
"03 30, 2012",I love the 6 cyl. zip!,"I've owned the RAV4 for a year now & do daily commuting & the occasional long road trip. I wish the gas mileage was better, but I like the extra power of the V-6; it has a smooth ride & good handling. There are lots of extra features I enjoy (heated seats, 4WD, back up cam, sunroof) & the styling is reasonable but not flashy. A nice, solid vehicle."
"03  4, 2012",2011 RAV4 4cyl. 4x4 OK but disappointed,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. engine 4x4. This was purchased as my mom's golden years vehicle. She wanted something she could see out of, was up high/easy to get in and out of, small-ish and got good gas mileage. Also, all the bells and whistles my dad refused to get in the past, so she chose an almost fully loaded Limited model.

Went with 4 cylinder engine to maximize MPG, but my area is short on front wheel drive 'Limited' models, so ended up with the 4 wheel drive. At the time of purchase, Toyota.com said 2 wheel drive models were not available for sale in my area (Md.). I don't know if this was due to the tsunami or just a regular sales decision.

There is no hill-holder or hill brake on the automatic transmission in the 4 cylinder model, so when you start on a steep hill the car rolls back like a manual transmission car. Really unnerves my mom. She tries to avoid hills. I've heard the hill brake may be an option (?) you can purchase, but seeing as she bought a Limited version and it didn't come with it, I doubt it. Maybe the front wheel drive only version has it? The V-6 does have it. We didn't encounter any substantial hills on our test drives so it didn't appear to be as rolly as it really is on big hills.

The gas mileage is awful for old lady drivers. My mom's short 2-5 mile stop-sign racing at 25-35 mph speeds result in 16-17mpg. But, one trip over 10 miles on the highway will bump the average to over 20mpg, but still nowhere near the big print advertised mileage, much closer to the small low end fine print mileage for the V-6. The ""break in period"" is bogus. Did average 28-30 mpg on a long interstate trip, but we cared more about the around town mileage.

I am 6'3"" and I find the seats to be slightly off. Seat bottoms are not quite wide enough or long enough, but it's not my car. But, at least your almost level with your co-pilot versus the Subaru Forester where the co-pilot sits down in a hole with the dash board at eye level. Overall, you can't beat the room available in the RAV4. Very roomy front and back. Oh, we only got the 2 rows of seats.

As most everyone notes, the swing out tailgate is not great, but you can learn to work with it. Only thing you can't work around is when it's raining; you don't have any cover and the rain just goes right in the back.

Overall the RAV4 is a great vehicle. The 4 cylinder has a lot of pep. More than enough to get you moving. Ride is tops for the type of vehicle, but by no means smooth or sedan-like. Wind and road noise is quieter than CR-V, but not as quiet as a sedan. Speaking of the CR-V, the RAV4 doesn't have any strong vibrations through the steering wheel when stopped at a light like the CR-V. That was a bit unnerving on our CR-V test drives. You'd be sitting at a light and it would just vibrate your arms. I think it was tied to the power steering and A/C system. Anyways, one of the cons for the CR-V that led to the RAV4 purchase. The interior details are great in the RAV4: cup holders, outlets, folding seats, sliding seats, armrest and glove boxes. The only other thing I don't like are the LCD displays. They look dated and detract from the style of the interior. A quibble, but eh..."
"01 30, 2012",First time Toyota Suv,"Engine...(4 cyl) transmission a little noisy when accelerating. But has plenty of power for 4 cyl.

Looks....Clean and Sharp exterior, interior space is the most available in small Sub class. seats have been comfortable on trips and general driving.

Radio....I don't Like not as good sounding as I would have e
Xspected..

Price......base model $ 21,000

I would recommend this vehicle 4-5 stars."
"01  3, 2012",Disappointed,"We own a 2011 4 cylinder front wheel drive RAV-4. The gas milage is not as good as we expected. We get about 20 per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.
Three times in two months the SUV engine raced and jumped while we were backing up. Toyta kept the car for three days and could not reproduce the issue.
This is our third Toyota SUV and our last. Toyota SUV's are not as reliable as their sedans. Toyota SUV's are not woth the price!"
"01  2, 2012",just breaking it in,"I like the way the car handles, the gas mileage is up and down, I have owned it for two months now, I have 2000 miles on it. I have not gotten more then 23 MPG at the highest and 18 MPG lowest. I have not driven more then 100 miles at a stretch on the highway. I am hoping it works itself into better MPG. I don't like the light color of cloth on interior doors. It really shows dirt and stains easily . other then this, I really like the car. It is
4 cylinder 4wd. It has power, for a 4 cylinder."
"12 27, 2011","New 2011 RAV4, LIMITED, Experience","Purchased the LIMITED V6 4x4 in Pacific Blue fully loaded with the exception of navigation. Since I own a Garmin, no sense in having both. JBL + Bluetooth, leather, tint, tow + more! Don't drive a V6 because you will ultimately buy it! Very comfortable ride although thirsty in the city with around 17-18 mpg around town, which is not too bad. No long trips yet, but should get 22 + even with weight of 4x4 and engine. Interior is good, but would have liked some upgrade in materials, however nicely crafted and roomy. Towing will be easy with the tow package and powerful engine. Little to no changes in 2012. Buy at end of month for good deal. Used prices are high so I opted for new, since they hold their value well. Not cheap, but all the vehicle one would need for travel, sport, etc."
"12 26, 2011",2011 RAV4,Solid basic small SUV. No real frills but it is reliable. Averaging 25 MPG city and 26.5 highway. Only compliant-road noise.
"12 23, 2011",new to toyota,"After much research..alot done on cars.com, I went with the Rav 4...based on reviews and material that I read. So far I am very happy with my choice...the 4 cylinder impresses me with its power and ease..the vehicle feels safe and solid...my last SUV was a 2000 Explorer and this is far superior in every way."
"12 13, 2011",Great Machine,"Great car for the money. V-6 motor and transmission combination better than before. Leather and options definitely make the car more enjoyable. Still has the dopey dashboard and odd interior design choices, but lots of SUV for the money. Anything else is $3,000-$5,000 more for the power and options."
"12  6, 2011",Excellent ride,When shopping I drove every 4 cyl all wheel drive car on the market. Rav4 was my first ride and ended going back and buying. Excellent handling and gas milage isn't bad either. I would reccommend to any one looking for an all wheel drive vehicle
"11 17, 2011",MOST DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AROUND.,"I OWNED A TOYOTA CAMARY FROM 1989 UNTIL 1999 AND IT STILL WAS DEPENDABLE AT 200,000 MILES AND THE NEXT VEHICLE I BOUGHT WAS A TOYOTA RAV. 4, 1999 MODEL AND STILL OWN IT WITH 155,000 MILES AND IT STILL DRIVES GREAT. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS VEHICLE FOR COMFORT, RELIABILITY, GOOD LOOKING, SPACIOUS, AND KEEPS ON TICKING. LOVE TOYOTA"
"11 15, 2011",Just what I wanted,This is an excellent car. It's exactly what I was looking for. I go on a lot of road trips so I wanted 4 wheel drive and a lot of cargo room. This car definitely has both. It is very reliable and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
"10 17, 2011",The Do Everything Vehicle,"We have the 2011 V6 Limited version with most of the extras except the navigation tool. Great gas mileage, great response on the highway, turns on a dime and extremely responsive. From the outside it appears quite compact. I have taken 80"" doors in for repair, transported a 5' bathtub from Home Depot to our home. Taken grandkids on various trips, 4 golfers including myself with all our gear. Looks good, rides great, never a fear of it not performing as advertised when we purchased it."
"10  4, 2011",Rav4,"We drove the Rav to Austin, TX and back to Seattle roundtrip of over 6000 miles. The ride was comfortable and enjoyable!"
"09 27, 2011",Great car,"We bought the RAV4 4 wheel drive V6. Incredibly, it gets better mileage than my Honda CRV even though the RAV4 has far superior performance. It also has more cargo space and a quieter ride. THe radio is quite good.
THe only cons include an annoying squeak in the dashboard and the inferior tires that they equip the car with that we were warned would not last for too long. THe tires are Bridgestone Duelers.
This is one sweet ride and I expect it to handle our harsh winters well once we get better tires on it for winter driving.

One other con relates to the fact that the car which cost a considerable amount does not include floor mats which to me is shocking."
"08 26, 2011",First Toyota,"I have always owned Hondas and I love the look and the way the Toyota drives. It is sporty and I'm a not a Mini Van Mom driver anymore. I have the extra seats if I need to drive my kids friends. It gets great gas mileage, and so easy to get in and out of space?"
"08 21, 2011",Great Car,"In February 2011 I purchased a Toyota Rav4. So far I have been very pleased with the car except for two things 1) I cannot buckle the middle seat belt in the back seat. It has some sort of dual lock but even with the manual I can't see how it works. I think something is wrong with it. I am going to have to contact the dealer because no one I know can figure it out. Since we have the optional third row we have never needed to use that buckle yet. 2) I am not happy with the car doors, especially the back seat doors. You have to really slam them to get them to close tight on the first try and when they close (this applies to all the doors) it sounds like a tin can. The sound makes the car seem really cheap. If pressed to list any and all complaints I guess I would have to say that I dislike clock and the placement it, it makes the interior of the car look very dated to me. Although after having the car for a month or so I was completely used to it. Other than these few minor things (I will contact the dealer to fix or explain the seat belt) I really love the car. It has a nice smooth ride and so far it has been great."
"07 29, 2011",Exactly what I was looking for.,"I needed a family car with cargo room that still had some sportiness to it. The 2011 Rav4 met all of my needs, and made letting go of my beloved (and still running great) '99 Honda Prelude palatable."
"07 28, 2011",Affordible SUV,"Satisfied but new models should have:
1. six speed trans,
2. better seats with wider backs
3. better tires
4. Get better MPG"
"07 21, 2011",2011 Rav 4,An ok car but a little light on the bells and whistles for the money. Runs ok but a little rough compared to other small SUVs.
"07  8, 2011",Good Car,"It is a good car. I liked the third row seats. I can used it when I need. Otherwise, I can fold them down. I installed a navigation from Toyoter Service. I don't like the installed Navigation. It has some problems. Perhaps, Toyota's factory installed navigation is better."
"06  2, 2011",NICE CAR,"NICE SIZE SUV, HAS EVERY THING YOU WOULD NEED FOR COMFORT AND RIDE. HAS GOOD STYLING FOR ITS SIZE. VERY COMPETIVE IN ITS SIZE"
"05 30, 2011",Fall In Love again,"Love LOve LOVe LOVE this little suv! I am the mom of three grown boys(two still in college),when I get in my Rav4 and head down the road I feel 16 again. This car does anything I ask it to do. The only thing I can really complain about and it's very minor, when I close the door it sounds a little tinnie. It is a 4 cylinder front wheel drive and it has plenty of get up and go. I am very happy with my purchase just ask my kids. My three favorite things about my car are keyless entry, keyless start and the sunroof. I would highly recommend you give the Rav4 a try you just might fall in love again."

Negatives: Stripping along side of car to prevent
other car doors damaging, is much,
much smaller and not well placed.

Gear shifting is complicated by manufac-
turer trying to give some semblence to a
standard transmission. Writer's first car
was a standard transmission.

Interior arrangement and seemingly un-
necessary placement of some operative
instrument are confusing. Once again,
the manufacturer is reaching out in des-
peration to make the newest model dif-
ferent. Too bad, the first few years the
models changed little if at all. It all be-
gan when they extended the body 14"",
playing havoc with the MPG and making
it difficult to park in a two car garage.

Toyota. You really going to print this?"
"05 20, 2011",Versatile and Fun,"Bought new 4x4 Limited with v6 in 2009. Have 43,000 miles on car. This is the best car I have ever owned and am still waiting for something to break!
Lightning fast, steady and quiet at 75mph, and great breaking. 26mpg at 75. 31mpg at 60mph.
I tow a small boat easily.
Seat are comfortable, back seat roomy, and storage a plenty. I like the spare outside to gain the interior room.
I also like the swing out rear door because I no longer hit my head on old mini van rear door.
JBL Sound system, blue tooth, sirius radio, and i pod plug in all work great."
"05 16, 2011",A very good car,"A fund car to drive and very peppy for a four cylinder
Model.a little less economy than advertise but still
Efficient."
"05 11, 2011",Greatest value for the money.,"I purchased the Sport model. It came with lots of extras including a six cylinder engine. The salesperson told me that the difference in gas mileage between the four cylinder and six cylinder engine is only one mile per gallon. I am impressed by the roominess inside. The height, width and depth of the driver's seat suits me perfectly. The steering wheel is adjustible as to the angle and space from the dash. The combination of ample room and adjustibility is perfect for driver comfort.

The six cylinder engine and four speed transmission results in responsive and smooth acceleration for interstate access. The cargo area is spacious and the flattening of the 2nd row seats is easy and can be controlled from the rear of the car.

I also appreciate the quiet cabin. Very little, if any, road or wind noise. The video screen that appears in the rear view mirror makes for safer backing than just the mirrors. All in all, I have no complaints and find it difficult to think of a single problem with this car."
"05  5, 2011",Perfect for me and grandkids,"I have the seven passenger Rav 4 and it is perfect for hauling my grandchildren around in, as three in car seats and one on the way to be in car seat, so had to have room, but yet wanted good gas mileage and this vehicle was exactly what I was looking for."
"04 30, 2011",Limited V-6 4WD,"Short front seats leads to backache & fatigue even on short trips on 5'9"" driver. Power tilt on driver side does not angle high enough at front of seat. V-6 jumpy on throttle from a stop. Limited rides stiffly over bumps and road reflectors. Versatile sliding, folding, reclining rear seat. Rear seat pull downs from the hatch area are useful. Navigation system is poor and couldn't get the JBL radio with the Nav. Oil change surprise on V-6 since the oil filter is paper and the filter itself costs $35-$50! After living with it, no longer satisfied."
"04 27, 2011","Comfortable, sporty, all around great","We were looking for a car that you could get in and out of easily (sits up higher) and this was the ticket! Also it is roomy without being extremely big.
Feels good from every aspect.
Very pleased."
"04 26, 2011",Great Car,"The V6 Rav4 is a great car - fast, fun to drive, easy to maneuver. The MP3 changer is great. I wish the steering mounted controls were standard on every trim - but it can be added afterwards without much trouble (people on RAV4 forums have done this). Mine has the 3rd row seats. They are small but usable for short trips around town. Only dislike on styling is the rear mounted spare tire - wish it were hidden like the CR-V."
"04 23, 2011",2011 RAV4 V6 4WD vs 2009 CRV EX AWD,"I traded in my 2009 Honda CR-V, EX, AWD on the 2011 Toyota RAV4, Limited, V6, 4WD. Both were bought new by me.
CRV Pros:
Better exterior looks.
Better seating comfort.
Lift hatchback rear door.
Feels like it has more interior room than RAV4.
CRV Cons:
Severely under powered for even routine driving.
RAV4 V6 Pros:
GREAT power!
Almost the same fuel milage as the 4 cyl CRV.
Twice the towing capacity.
Ability to lock in the 4WD manually (not available on CRV).
Climate control.
Full-size spare.
RAV4 V6 Cons:
The side opening rear door sucks!
The back seat is not sized for adults. The back rest height barely comes up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Definitely not sized for anything more than small children.
Very dated orange-yellow back lighting as opposed to the modern looking blue in the CRV.

For me, the three selling points for the RAV4 are the fantastic V6 with it's great power and MPG. The ability to manually lock-in the 4WD. And, it can tow more than the CRV.
I WOULD NOT buy the CRV because of the ridiculously under powered nature of the engine. It is horrible! However, if the CRV was available with the V6 similar to the RAV4 I would unquestionably buy the CRV over the RAV4.
I hope this helps someone considering the two SUVs."
"04  5, 2011",Very reliable car,"Big change from my old 2003 Rav4. Ride has improved and road noise is greatly reduced.
V6 engine runs smooth and much more power than the 4 cyl. engine."
"03 31, 2011",Best 4wd vehicle I have ever owned!,"Drives like a car while performing like an SUV. Simple, sturdy and reliable with a superb blend of attributes."
"03 27, 2011",merced toyota is the best,The RAV4 is a very different type of vehicle than the sedans and coupes previously owned. The RAV4 has great forward visibility. It feels bigger than it looks. The base model features are good.
"03 25, 2011",2011 RAV 4 review,"My second RAV4, a number of enhancements have been made on my LTD model since the 2007 model year I previously owned. The V6 is a great engine but my previous RAV had an annoying whine at 60 to 65 mph. Improvements in the electronically controlled transmission software have made the 2011 whisper quiet at these speeds. The smart key entry system works flawlessly and is great when you've got armfuls of stuff and can't fish the key out of your pocket. It even works when I'm wearing gloves. Zero squeaks or rattles, even in cold weather. V6 combined mileage has been in the 24 to 26 range, really good for a V6 4WD. Poor weather handling has been excellent, very stable on bad roads. No regrets in buying another one."
"03 22, 2011",Great Car,I had a Rav4 as a rental & decided to buy one. Best car I've ever owned & a good sized SUV for the city.
"03 22, 2011",Great in Snow & Ice,RAV4 handles well in the poorest of road conditions. Gives the driver the confidence in the cars ability to get you to your destination. Wind noise with rear windows cracked or open is quite annoying. Standard drivers seat can get uncomfortable. Rear window seems to get dirty quite easily. GREAT forward visability!
"03 14, 2011",Great car,"We recently sold our 2002 4Runner and bought a 2011 RAV4 sport. We look the outside and the intrerior is very well designed. The seats are comfortable and the interior has ample room for everything we need to fit, including the 2 car seats we'll be putting in later this year when our twins arrive. Ample power as the 179 hp is only slightly less than the '02 4Runner V6. It sips gas for an SUV."
"03 12, 2011",RAV4 Then and Now 2002-2011,Owned a 2002 RAV4 before buying this 2011 version. The new model is around 20% bigger and this change has more of an impact than I thought it would. On the plus side there is a lot more cargo room with or without the back seats folded down (I did not get the third row seat version) and more head room for taller passengers. On the minus side this is now a mid to large SUV so no more squeezing into the only tight parking spot left. I miss the ability I had with my 2002 version of taking out the rear seats for more cargo room and better gas mileage. However with the 2011 you get an extra glove box shelf and a variety of driver seat adjustments. Over all I like the new car and like anything new it takes some getting used to.
"03  8, 2011",the best,I am completely satisfied with the Rav SPORT model for 2011 Styling and comfort as well as satellite radio -best Toyota I have ever owned.
"03  5, 2011",2011 Toyota RAV4,"I love the car so far. It's quiet yet responsive. I have driven it in the snow and heavy rain. The Interiers are easy to use and all needed. Handling is great.

However, shouldn't the XM radio subscription come free with the deal, rather than just 3 months?"
"03  5, 2011",Great vehicle,I have the v6 model and it has great power along with shure footed in snow. Lots of room inside and a comfortable ride.
"03  1, 2011",the car that exceeded my expectations,"I wanted a compact SUV that gets good gas mileage,has a third row seat for my kids and comes in red!Did my research and came up with the RAV4 that I've been eyeing for a couple years already for its looks. We found one in a neighboring state and picked it up without even test driving it.No regrets as the Limited V6 has awesome acceleration!Talk about zoom,zoom!I live in Reno and its been great in the snow.My fellow musicians are in awe of the JBL speakers too."
"02 22, 2011",Glad I bought it!,"I bought this vehicle just as the snows descended on New England. I couldn't get this car to slip or slide! The V6 has ample horsepower, tranny shifts smoothly, butter-soft acceleration. I hope to keep it a very long time..."
"01 29, 2011",Bumpy ride,This SUV does not have the smoothest ride. You feel every bump on the road. It makes me wish I bought a regular car for a better ride. I wouldn't buy another one. I should have checked out the Honda's.
"12 30, 2010",I LOVE my new Rav4,"After 14 years as a Camry owner, I am a real Toyota believer. Even with the bad publicity Toyota endured earlier in 2010, I was not swayed from their product lines. However, I did want to sit up higher and have more visibility, so I decided to check out the Rav4 Limited, and I can't be happier with my decision. For once, I did not stint on the options, and already I am loving the heated leather seats (the cold winter in NYC so far has allowed me to really appreciate them) and the stereo system is fantastic. But the ride is the best - smooth, powerful, and pretty economical on the gas (though a bit less than the Camry, its true). I love the styling both outside and in, and feel I am a king in my new car."
"12  6, 2010",Rav4 for Mom,Mom loves it. Not the car for me but for her it is perfect. She lives in Colorado and it works great in the snow.
"12 30, 2023",Great value in a dependable fun used car,"We bought a 2011 AWD base model for our daughter just as the pandemic was starting. Three years later it has 120,000 miles on it and runs flawlessly. I just put on new shocks and struts and it rides like new. The driver side front axle seal needed replacement. The V6 has power to spare even in the mountain west, and makes it fun to drive. It's now worth a bit more than we paid for it."
"11  4, 2023",Still runs great!,"This is the best, most reliable car I have ever owned. Other than seals on the rear differential, I have done nothing to the car, other than brakes and routine maintenance. We have 157000 miles on it and it runs like new."
"11 23, 2022",2011 Toyota rav 4,I bought this vehicle used. Grinds when you go 30 miles an hour I want to know if there is recalls on vehicle and how to get them
"06 13, 2021",Best vehicle I have ever owned,"It is spacious, very comfortable more especially long distance. 
I still prefer this model in terms of looks as opposed to new models.
It is very low maintenance. I just love it"
"05 13, 2021","I love this car, so much!","This car, “Angel” is her name, is such a wonderful car, I just love it so much. I purchased it from a previous owner who had purchased it brand new when it came out but only drove it from home to a train station parking lot and then back home, the entire time. It had about 60k  miles on it and was in stellar condition. I just had to buy all new tires and just replaced the battery, last month. 

When I bought it in 2020, I was elated to have just found such a grand deal and my word, it has lived up to my expectations and then some. It’s so easy to drive. It is very comfortable, inside, the trunk and storage room back there is ample and with optimal care ( I take great care of this car, no slacking) it runs like a dream. 

Gas mileage is pretty good. I use ‘Plus’ gas in it. During a recent drive from Jersey to SC and back,  I filled up approx. every 4 hours at 1/4 tank left but yeah, I drove and opened that baby up like she’s never seen and quite frankly, it feels like it drives even better now, after that trip.

I love this car. It’s just big enough for me and stylishly speaking, it’s super cute. The only thing is that I’m a ‘sunroof’ person. My very first car had a sunroof and I’ve loved them ever since but I get enough sun and light through all of this cars windows so, well, that’s my only wish. 

Anyway, did I say ‘I love this car’, already? She is a dreamboat and I will drive her and care for her until she takes her last trek and breath :)
Adventure; we’ve got a lot to get into."
"01  7, 2021",Wouldn’t want any other car to be my first!,"The performance on this car is fantastic, from great gas miles and the smooth V6 engine, this car is runs great. Comfortable interior, very spacious and you don’t feel every bump in the road. Extra under storage in the trunk is so convenient. Feels very safe to be in as well. Only issue is back seat tracks are rusted from previous owner not cleaning water from a storm of the metal properly after leaving windows open, so they squeak when going over bumps. Other than that, I love my Rav4!"
"12 12, 2020",Great driving vehicle!,The RAV4 drives excellent! I now own 4 Toyotas! I absolutely love them! This is my first RAV4. It drives great and handles even better!
"11  9, 2020","I've enjoyed my RAV4, it takes me where I want","It is attractive, reliable, handles well and has never failed me.  I like the wheel on the back because I can find it in the parking lot"
"06 22, 2020",Spacious for a compact.,"Very impressed with the turning radius and the ease at which the engine tackles hills and speed. Very comfortable, and the air works very well. The back has plenty of room to pack my stuff. I do wish this vehicle had a tire on the back like the 12 that I saw, but that might just be an optional feature."
"06 12, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever had.,"My car has made me feel safe when I'm driving anywhere, especially in the winter times. When I decide to buy another car it will be a Toyota."
"06  8, 2020",Dependable and good all around.,"This car has a strong V6, good fuel economy, decent comfort and durability, and looks good.  Radio interface is far outdated but JBL speakers sound great.  Shock boots tear and lead to some squeaking but no major issues.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
"06  1, 2020",21 MPG city 28 MPG highway,"4th Toyota RAV I owned over the years, fully loaded & detailed! Best SUV on the road, safety, durability & lasting! I have 2019 & 2020 also. Never uses a drop of oil between changes."
"04 26, 2020",Excellent vehicle,"One of the best vehicles for Midwest, with AWD option it is same good for    highway, off road or winter driving. With 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine has a very good gas mileage."
"03 15, 2020",I love this car.,"This isn't the fanciest car in the world, but it is perfect for me. It is easy to park and is peppy enough to merge into traffic, and easy to get in and out of and there is lots of space for dogs, shopping, and all the crap I haul around. And, it gets decent gas milage. My favorite thing is the good visibility I have when driving."

"02  2, 2020",Drove for 60k miles and its great!,"Great car for all weather and terrains. Even with the base model, the capabilities of this car are still great almost ten years later. Drives great and have never had issues with traction in winter or on wet roads. Cheap to maintain and handles great!"
"12 25, 2019",Smooth ride and reliable,Blue tooth ready has 3rd row seating lots of leg room heated seats push button engine start roomy cargo area great for hauling lumber supplies
"12 11, 2019",My 1st car I have ever owned,"This Rav4 car did everything it was asked of and more by my family, my friends, And I. This car has more than enough room to carry a full-size double refrigerator or eight people. It great on gas mileage as well"
"11 24, 2019",Like a Timex,"4 wheel drive a major plus. Just 7 "" ground clearance, but it isn't a Wrangler.

Interior lights are TOO DIM. Have a flashlight handy. 

Good milage, easy maintenance."
"11  9, 2019",Very cheap on gas and comfortable driving.,The car has a lot of room and easy on gas. Very reliable and no issues with the car. Just Keep it maintained and will last long.
"09 14, 2019",Seems reliable but not impressed,"After 8 years, only 57000 miles, several recalls, local Toyota dealer refused to service vehicle or provide warranty recalls after purchase,  dealer refused to provide oil changes per contract and national Toyota advertisement - told me they did not realize it was expensive 0W-20 synthetic oil ( this was in 2011), Bluetooth is calls only, front cup holders do not hold taller cups, drives like go-cart  (steering is very sensitive), rough noisy  ride, things are glitchy - Bluetooth sometimes go out, back up camera sometimes goes out but mine is NOT included in the national recall, front left window makes loud cracking noise when going up, seats front and rear are not comfortable, front windshield has been replaced 3 times in 3 years - prone to damage,  original tires were the worst replaced at 25,000 miles,  difficulty getting replacement parts,  cowel on rear wheels sticks out 1/2"" and gets pitted by rocks - looks bad.  I do not want another Toyota."
"09 13, 2019",A great car at a great price.,"Comfortable, fun, and Toyota reliability. Very spacious for a small SUV.  Easy to maintain, and handles great. A great car for the price, I could not recommend it more."

"04 26, 2019",It has been very reliable so far.,This car has met all my expectations. Love the way it handles the road. The ride is great compare to all cars I tested.  Still looks good for being a used car.
"04 18, 2019",Love my car. Hate constant dash lights,"For last five  years, my dashboard on my 2011 Toyota RAV 4 has had check engine, four wheel drive, and traction control lights on. At inspection time, we spend $95 for a machine to tell us that the O2 sensor needs replacing and $80 for a new sensor. 19 to 20 miles after we get the sticker, the dash lights come back on and stay that way for another year. We just paid $80 for a different sensor before going to get a sticker and lights didn’t stay off long enough to get to a garage to get inspected. Called Downeast Toyota in Brewer where we bought the car and it will cost another $95 to have the diagnostic machine tell us the same thing again. Fed up is the least of my feelings."
"02  5, 2019",Back To Toyota For Reliability,"A sporty little ride. Basic and no-frills, but gets from Point A to Point B. Good on gas, and with some snow tires added will go where I need to go."
"01  9, 2019",Best Car Purchase in Years,I am very happy with this car.  It has the distinct body styling I prefer and has handled well even in the ice and snow.  I find it easy to drive and reminds me of my classic 1999 Honda CRV (which I would clone if I could).
"12 16, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"Excellent car but 2 main issues one the AC not good , and two the breaks keeps tearing off fast and not that strong as Nissan but have no idea about other Toyota models but over all Toyota cars n trucks are 100% reliable and re selling value cars"

"11 26, 2018",A Good Buy for the Money,"I purchased the Rav 4 because (1) it is a Toyota and (2) it has low mileage for a 2011 vehicle 26,000 miles). I wanted a small SUV with low mileage, a great reputation for reliability, a full size spare tire, 4 wheel drive, , attractiveness, and fuel economy.  I was actually looking for a V6 but settled for a 4 cylinder (2.5 liter) since I would get better fuel economy."
"11 22, 2018","Bought new . Now rav has 45,000 mi. Never failed .","In 45,000 miles the rav has never failed to get me where I was going . Last month my city had a flood .

I am loyal to Toyota rav4"
"04 29, 2018",First AWD I've owned,This car is great. The AWD also has the 4 wheel lock so I can feel confident getting out in the rain and snow. I live a mile from a blacktop road so this gives me peace of mind. The RAV4 has plenty of room for passengers as well as a cargo area. The seats are comfortable and there's a lot of legroom. With multiple storage compartments there's no cramming everything into a single glove box. The car is easy to get in and out of which is really nice when I'm feeling my age. I love the side opening rear door instead of a hatchback.
"04  7, 2018",very reliable and sturdy,"bought it for my twins got them through high school and college and never let us down.

"09  8, 2017",First comfortable car I've owned,I looked at many vehicles and this was the only one that fit me good.  As a short person I am able to put the seat up enough to reach the pedals without feeling to close to the steering wheel and after breaking my back this SUV is very comfortable.  I love all the features it comes with.  I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends.
"09  7, 2017",Nice car,"Great little SUV.  27 mpg+, quiet, loads of interior space.  Tailgate mounted swinging spare tire is a drawback."
"09  7, 2017",Best SUV,I've owned a couple of older RAV4's and absolutely love them!  You can't beat Toyota for reliability and performance. If I had to pick only one all around car to own it would an older model RAV.

"08 17, 2017",Smooth stylish ride!,"I absolutely love my Toyota Rav4 it's comfortable for my whole family and drives smoothly and quietly! You do have to be careful with the transmission fluid if it's low or too full it will shift a little rough from reverse to drive but if you have just the right amount it is smooth as can be. I was very surprised by the trunk space for this smaller suv but having the spare tire on the tailgate makes all the difference, I am excited to play with this car in the snow and se how it does!"
"08  6, 2017",very reliable,Fun to drive. I feel safe and comfortable.  It is easy to dive. I have no blind spots.  Good ac and stereo.
"08  4, 2017",Love love love my RAV 4,"I own two Toyota RAV4 4's, a 2011 and a 2009. They are both work horses. V6 gives me the power to tow, and enough torque to quickly accelerate onto the highway. I was not a fan of the newer 4 cylinder versions so I have purchased two of the older V6 (no longer produced).  One of these was purchased due to storage room in the back end for my son that is a Hockey Goalie and he hauls a lot of large gear."
"08  2, 2017","Comfort, style, economy","Love my used RAV4! So comfortable and stylish, roomy and great on gas! Plenty of room and easy to drive. And so many extra touches!"
"08  1, 2017",A very dependable utility buggy,This is a great car - SUV- or whatever you want to call it. It's very dependable and useful. The cargo area is deceptively large when the back seat is folded down. I've been able to carry a small couch in there. I also got a double bed to fit one day. This is a super useful vehicle.
"07 18, 2017","Sporty, great handling, holds everything I need!",This SUV holds much more than I expected. Handles great in snow/ice. Big enough for three adults to sit comfortably in the back seat.
"07 12, 2017",Rock solid reliability!,"Solid, smooth engine. A little underpowered with the 4 cylinder and 4wd. The transmission is very smooth. It is awesome in snow and averages 22 mpg city. My only complaint would be the highway fuel mileage. Manufacturer claims 27 on highway. Best I've seen is 26, but usually average 24-25. I guess it's because it only a 4 speed transmission."
"07 12, 2017",Best car for the money,The nicest used car I've ever owned it rides and handles really sporty for being an suv I would recommend this car to anyone.
"07  9, 2017",Reliability is outstanding for all road conditions,"Well thought out vehicle for real life atmosphere that people encounter everyday. Suspension is great, very reliable and drives smooth. Wasn't a fan of Toyota. Now that I bought one. Very impressed with the performance that I see in the vehicle. 4x4 is great. Engineering in vehicle is well planned and would think it took the simplest thought of what you wished or wanted out of a vehicle.  Especially in bad weather or bad road conditions."
"07  8, 2017",Second of 2 Ravs.,"This vehicle meets all my needs. Great style, comfort and handling. Just the right size for our needs."
"06 15, 2017",Graduated to Rav 4 after 20 years in Sienns,My kids are all grown and I was ready for something fun and less mom. I found that in the Rav 4!! It's zippier than a minivan but still has the compact feel of a car. I love the look and drive but do wish the seats were a bit comfier.
"06  1, 2017",Nicest Upgrade in Several Years,"Was looking for an AWD SUV that would fit the short space available in my garage.  This RAV4 had almost all the options I sought, good cargo room, fair power (for a 4 cyl), and feels good in the driver's seat.  Front passenger seat not as comfortable because it doesn't have the height adjust like driver's.  Only had this car a couple weeks, so reliability rating is of previous Toyota experience.  Used to be a GM person, but Toyota and Honda both have both won me over from several of the recent GM I've worked on or driven."
"05 14, 2017",Kgorkin,Best vehicle I have owned.  No issues keep the maintenance up and it will run forever. Geat in the snow plenty of power. Thhe 3rd generation is the one to have. My wfe has a 2013 4th gen we like the old one better.
"05 10, 2017",Perfect Compact SUV,This is a great lil SUV. Holds 4 adults fairly comfortably and the one we have has all the options so that makes the ride even better.
"04  6, 2017",Reliable !,Very reliable with the plenty of power V6 option available. In the RAV4 sport that we own it has great power and great torque to do what we need to do and go where we need to go with the all wheel drive
"03 28, 2017",As expected and a little more,"Toyota has built a great reputation and I expected the RAV4 to follow suit. Luxury was not what I was looking for, but functionality. Visibility is great in this car, it has lots of room and has a lot more pep from its four cylinder than my '05 Escape with a V6. Trivial items like the floor shifter stem looks ""thin"", the ""headlights are on"" dash indicator light a little bright and the driver's seat seatbelt receptacle too low, but nothing of extreme annoyance. I enjoy driving this car."
"03 28, 2017",Great car for distance comfortable and good on gas,Toyota makes a great reliable car that has excellent gas mileage . The Toyota Rav 4 is great for travel and vacations. Lots of room for luggage and passengers. I would recommend this car to all my family and friends.
"03 28, 2017",RAV4 overview,Stylish and practical with good value for the money. Only drawback is the seats not comfortable enough.
"03 24, 2017",Another reliable Toyota,"I have owned numerous cars but my Toyota Sienna was by far the most reliable and cheapest vehicle to maintain. When I was in the market for a replacement vehicle I went right for the Toyota again only this time I don't need minivan as my kids are grown.
The Rav 4 drives lovely, is trying and has a lot of features that make driving comfortable and convenient!  So far I love everything about it and I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it like I did my Sienna."
"03 21, 2017",the word dependable and that no lie,I wake in the morning that all is good with  this rav4. they build convince in there cars and faith that is my the best for my family.
"03 15, 2017",Toyota Rav4 2011,Its a confort car and Smoth and is safe and thanks form the saler Juan Gamara for his excelent atention
"03 13, 2017",Great Value,"This car gets great gas millage, has good cargo capacity, and very reliable all for an affordable price."
"03  9, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"I just purchased this vehicle.  It was highly recommended to me.  It's comfort, performance, exterior styling, interior design all deserve a 5* rating, as well as value for the money and reliability.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"12 11, 2016",I love it,"This is my second RAV4 and I've loved them both! Good looking, smooth ride, lots of space. Toyota is reliable and I plan on driving this for a long time."
"11 24, 2016",2011 Rav 4,Always enjoyed this brand   Rav 4  is a good SUV style for a reasonable price and gas mileage.  I recommend to anyone looking to get out of a car and into something a little different
"01  8, 2016",Wilfredo Vega Best Sales Associate,"Thank you for everything, we appreciate everything that you have helped me with. I didn't have great credit but you managed a way for me to make it work! I have a great car thanks to Wilfredo Vega, sales and leasing consultant.

Thank you from Mr. and Mrs. Ventura"
"09  9, 2014",Reliable and comfortable,I purchased the car few months back and I have good experience. I am really enjoying the SUV drive. I like the pick up. Most of the times i have issues in the Cruise control speed adjusting sometimes it takes huge pickup suddenly kind of jerk. Everything is good but I see few things especially the suspension is not as good as it is. Rear Seats are comfortable only for two and if third person sits then it would be congested.
"03 28, 2014",Best Small SUV I've Owned!,"I've owned an Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Cherokee, and a Honda CRV. THis little gem is by far my favorite. I'm short, so the adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel are a huge plus for me. It handles like a dream and has a peppy pick-up. I have the leather package and sunroof, and it gives it a sporty feel.
It rains a lot in New Orleans, and our streets aren't the smoothest, which is why I drive SUVs. This little baby is a dream for these conditions. The back seat has ample leg room, and the controls are within easy reach. I love it."
"12  7, 2013",Everything I expected and more,"We recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 sport from Toyota of Manhattan and really love the car, and we also had a very pleasant experience with all of the staff at the dealership, very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and much to my surprise we are getting slightly better MPG than our other SUV that we traded in. I also have slightly more cargo space than I did before and the car is very comfortable and handles very well. I've owned many Toyotas and have never been disappointed with their products, it looks like we found another quality car that will serve us well for many years to come."
"11  1, 2013",Watch for paint issues,"I have paint coming off of the roof between the windshield and sunroof. I showed this to the dealer and they raised the issue to Toyota. Since the car has over the 36K miles warrantee I was simply told they don't care and it was not their problem. The car is less than 36 months old and because of my job I have to put on more miles. You will notice paint issues. The depth of paint varies on the roof from the rest of the car as measured at the dealership.
Realize that there is NO advantage to having a Toyota over any of the other manufacturers. The quality is not better nor is the service."
"06 30, 2013",Great smaller alternative to the Highlander,"I traded my highlander for the rav4. Yes, smaller and less room, but gas mileage, reliability, small easy to maneuver...worth the trade. Tough at first, I lived my highlander, but w gas priced and no longer needing the extra room, I'm very happy w the trade. Mine is the bade model e the ESV pkg...I.e. moonroof, bigger nicer rims and tires, 6 CDplayer. ONE BAD THING...huge for me,maybe not for you. The radio stinks!!! DDoesn't go anywhere near adas loud as my highlander. I'm learning to live w it. Oh yeah, I bought used and the person before added a Bluetooth. Love this!!! If you don't have one, get one. Worth every penny!!!"
"06 23, 2013",Quite happy with it!,It's only been a month since I got my used RAV4. So far I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to someone with a brain injury or with depth perception problems. After years in a lower car I feel I have better command of the road.
"06 19, 2013",good car,this is a good car for me and my freinds and family i only use it in the snowing months. with winter in this area . it has all wheal drive.
"04 17, 2013",Best and Safest car my daughter has ever had,"This 2011 RAV4 replaces a 2004 RAV4 with 166,000 miles that was in an accident and totalled, the 2004 was still in great shape and trouble free. This 2011 RAV4 is a phenomenal car, great value, great inside and outside styling, the 4 cylinder engine is economical and peppy, the 4 speed automatic transmission is smooth, the 4 wheel disc brakes stop great, the AWD system is flawless, seats are comfortable, the inside space is great, the comfort features are wonderful, this RAV4 has the Run Flat tires that ride a little harsh but convenient in case of a flat, the moon/sunroof is a treat and the multi-CD radio sounds great. If you're looking for a small AWD SUV, this is such a great choice, not the most luxurious but such a great value, I'll buy another RAV4 anytime without hesitation."
"01 26, 2013",Quality with power and excellent mileage.,"Smooth power, spacious, comfortable, and extremely well built. Handles well and easy to get into. Fully featured. Only wish it had 6 or 7 speed transmission which would probably help produce better gas mileage. Still satisfied with the mileage considering the horse power this car has. Would recomend to friends and family"
"12 25, 2012",Have to wait and see how it works..just bought it,Loooks good so far................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"08 14, 2012",BUTNING RAV4 SPORT,"Ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy, it?s not a family car. I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. It burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 2 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's not too bad. Now I just add oil every other month, after 4-recall I think I made a big mistake buying the RAV4."
"06 26, 2012",New Toyota rav 4Limited nice ride,"This limited Rav4 has leather moon roof power heated seats etc;I love the appearance,the ride and performance of this vehicle.I am glad I bought the v6 the engine it is smooth and quiet.The storng acceleration and performance is worth the extrta money. the gas mileage of mixed driving in hilly terrain is 23mpg. I am anxious to take it on A trip. I only have 1200 miles.The ext. is Blizzard Pearl,with tan leather and a tan pin stripe. The 4 cylinder performance was adequate , but not fun to drive like the v6."
"06  4, 2012",Nice suv,"Nice small SUV. Still gives the ""feel"" of a bigger and taller SUV, but compact...seems nearly as large inside as my 2003 Highlander."
"05 14, 2012",My 2011 Rav4 V6 sport,"After I purchased my 2011 Rav V6 sport there was a rattling noise coming from the moonroof that was horribly ruining my early ownership experience. Dealer kept the car three days and managed to replace the wind deflector but even with the new wind deflector on the noise was still there although not as loud as before. It's been one month and a half and I am realizing that the drive shaft whines considerably loud at low speeds(30-45 mph). I am definitely having that looked but the car had only 7300 miles on it when I bought it and it is bothering me to the point I would not consider buying used anymore. There is only one thing I will have to say that the V6 is strong and fast and that the car is pretty good looking too, compare to the competition. The fact that it is a Sport model and comes with tuned suspension makes the ride harsh and stiff. You may consider that prior to purchasing. Bottom line, Toyota lacks bells and whistles so if you are into technology, innovation, and interior quality, today's Rav4 does not offer anything exciting. Reliability has also dropped in my opinion since this is the second Rav I own. I am sorry but it is just a plain car that has lost its vision and more importantly has forgotten what sport really means."
"04 17, 2012",2011 Rav 4,"Excellent styling. The performance of the v-6 is also excellent. I've been driving on snow and ice. The ABS, 4WD, and the stock all weather 18"" tires work very well together."
"03 30, 2012",I love the 6 cyl. zip!,"I've owned the RAV4 for a year now & do daily commuting & the occasional long road trip. I wish the gas mileage was better, but I like the extra power of the V-6; it has a smooth ride & good handling. There are lots of extra features I enjoy (heated seats, 4WD, back up cam, sunroof) & the styling is reasonable but not flashy. A nice, solid vehicle."
"03  4, 2012",2011 RAV4 4cyl. 4x4 OK but disappointed,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. engine 4x4. This was purchased as my mom's golden years vehicle. She wanted something she could see out of, was up high/easy to get in and out of, small-ish and got good gas mileage. Also, all the bells and whistles my dad refused to get in the past, so she chose an almost fully loaded Limited model.

Went with 4 cylinder engine to maximize MPG, but my area is short on front wheel drive 'Limited' models, so ended up with the 4 wheel drive. At the time of purchase, Toyota.com said 2 wheel drive models were not available for sale in my area (Md.). I don't know if this was due to the tsunami or just a regular sales decision.

There is no hill-holder or hill brake on the automatic transmission in the 4 cylinder model, so when you start on a steep hill the car rolls back like a manual transmission car. Really unnerves my mom. She tries to avoid hills. I've heard the hill brake may be an option (?) you can purchase, but seeing as she bought a Limited version and it didn't come with it, I doubt it. Maybe the front wheel drive only version has it? The V-6 does have it. We didn't encounter any substantial hills on our test drives so it didn't appear to be as rolly as it really is on big hills.

The gas mileage is awful for old lady drivers. My mom's short 2-5 mile stop-sign racing at 25-35 mph speeds result in 16-17mpg. But, one trip over 10 miles on the highway will bump the average to over 20mpg, but still nowhere near the big print advertised mileage, much closer to the small low end fine print mileage for the V-6. The ""break in period"" is bogus. Did average 28-30 mpg on a long interstate trip, but we cared more about the around town mileage.

I am 6'3"" and I find the seats to be slightly off. Seat bottoms are not quite wide enough or long enough, but it's not my car. But, at least your almost level with your co-pilot versus the Subaru Forester where the co-pilot sits down in a hole with the dash board at eye level. Overall, you can't beat the room available in the RAV4. Very roomy front and back. Oh, we only got the 2 rows of seats.

As most everyone notes, the swing out tailgate is not great, but you can learn to work with it. Only thing you can't work around is when it's raining; you don't have any cover and the rain just goes right in the back.

Overall the RAV4 is a great vehicle. The 4 cylinder has a lot of pep. More than enough to get you moving. Ride is tops for the type of vehicle, but by no means smooth or sedan-like. Wind and road noise is quieter than CR-V, but not as quiet as a sedan. Speaking of the CR-V, the RAV4 doesn't have any strong vibrations through the steering wheel when stopped at a light like the CR-V. That was a bit unnerving on our CR-V test drives. You'd be sitting at a light and it would just vibrate your arms. I think it was tied to the power steering and A/C system. Anyways, one of the cons for the CR-V that led to the RAV4 purchase. The interior details are great in the RAV4: cup holders, outlets, folding seats, sliding seats, armrest and glove boxes. The only other thing I don't like are the LCD displays. They look dated and detract from the style of the interior. A quibble, but eh..."
"01 30, 2012",First time Toyota Suv,"Engine...(4 cyl) transmission a little noisy when accelerating. But has plenty of power for 4 cyl.

Looks....Clean and Sharp exterior, interior space is the most available in small Sub class. seats have been comfortable on trips and general driving.

Radio....I don't Like not as good sounding as I would have e
Xspected..

Price......base model $ 21,000

I would recommend this vehicle 4-5 stars."
"01  3, 2012",Disappointed,"We own a 2011 4 cylinder front wheel drive RAV-4. The gas milage is not as good as we expected. We get about 20 per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.
Three times in two months the SUV engine raced and jumped while we were backing up. Toyta kept the car for three days and could not reproduce the issue.
This is our third Toyota SUV and our last. Toyota SUV's are not as reliable as their sedans. Toyota SUV's are not woth the price!"
"01  2, 2012",just breaking it in,"I like the way the car handles, the gas mileage is up and down, I have owned it for two months now, I have 2000 miles on it. I have not gotten more then 23 MPG at the highest and 18 MPG lowest. I have not driven more then 100 miles at a stretch on the highway. I am hoping it works itself into better MPG. I don't like the light color of cloth on interior doors. It really shows dirt and stains easily . other then this, I really like the car. It is
4 cylinder 4wd. It has power, for a 4 cylinder."
"12 27, 2011","New 2011 RAV4, LIMITED, Experience","Purchased the LIMITED V6 4x4 in Pacific Blue fully loaded with the exception of navigation. Since I own a Garmin, no sense in having both. JBL + Bluetooth, leather, tint, tow + more! Don't drive a V6 because you will ultimately buy it! Very comfortable ride although thirsty in the city with around 17-18 mpg around town, which is not too bad. No long trips yet, but should get 22 + even with weight of 4x4 and engine. Interior is good, but would have liked some upgrade in materials, however nicely crafted and roomy. Towing will be easy with the tow package and powerful engine. Little to no changes in 2012. Buy at end of month for good deal. Used prices are high so I opted for new, since they hold their value well. Not cheap, but all the vehicle one would need for travel, sport, etc."
"12 26, 2011",2011 RAV4,Solid basic small SUV. No real frills but it is reliable. Averaging 25 MPG city and 26.5 highway. Only compliant-road noise.
"12 23, 2011",new to toyota,"After much research..alot done on cars.com, I went with the Rav 4...based on reviews and material that I read. So far I am very happy with my choice...the 4 cylinder impresses me with its power and ease..the vehicle feels safe and solid...my last SUV was a 2000 Explorer and this is far superior in every way."
"12 13, 2011",Great Machine,"Great car for the money. V-6 motor and transmission combination better than before. Leather and options definitely make the car more enjoyable. Still has the dopey dashboard and odd interior design choices, but lots of SUV for the money. Anything else is $3,000-$5,000 more for the power and options."
"12  6, 2011",Excellent ride,When shopping I drove every 4 cyl all wheel drive car on the market. Rav4 was my first ride and ended going back and buying. Excellent handling and gas milage isn't bad either. I would reccommend to any one looking for an all wheel drive vehicle
"11 17, 2011",MOST DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AROUND.,"I OWNED A TOYOTA CAMARY FROM 1989 UNTIL 1999 AND IT STILL WAS DEPENDABLE AT 200,000 MILES AND THE NEXT VEHICLE I BOUGHT WAS A TOYOTA RAV. 4, 1999 MODEL AND STILL OWN IT WITH 155,000 MILES AND IT STILL DRIVES GREAT. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS VEHICLE FOR COMFORT, RELIABILITY, GOOD LOOKING, SPACIOUS, AND KEEPS ON TICKING. LOVE TOYOTA"
"11 15, 2011",Just what I wanted,This is an excellent car. It's exactly what I was looking for. I go on a lot of road trips so I wanted 4 wheel drive and a lot of cargo room. This car definitely has both. It is very reliable and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
"10 17, 2011",The Do Everything Vehicle,"We have the 2011 V6 Limited version with most of the extras except the navigation tool. Great gas mileage, great response on the highway, turns on a dime and extremely responsive. From the outside it appears quite compact. I have taken 80"" doors in for repair, transported a 5' bathtub from Home Depot to our home. Taken grandkids on various trips, 4 golfers including myself with all our gear. Looks good, rides great, never a fear of it not performing as advertised when we purchased it."
"10  4, 2011",Rav4,"We drove the Rav to Austin, TX and back to Seattle roundtrip of over 6000 miles. The ride was comfortable and enjoyable!"
"09 27, 2011",Great car,"We bought the RAV4 4 wheel drive V6. Incredibly, it gets better mileage than my Honda CRV even though the RAV4 has far superior performance. It also has more cargo space and a quieter ride. THe radio is quite good.
THe only cons include an annoying squeak in the dashboard and the inferior tires that they equip the car with that we were warned would not last for too long. THe tires are Bridgestone Duelers.
This is one sweet ride and I expect it to handle our harsh winters well once we get better tires on it for winter driving.

One other con relates to the fact that the car which cost a considerable amount does not include floor mats which to me is shocking."
"08 26, 2011",First Toyota,"I have always owned Hondas and I love the look and the way the Toyota drives. It is sporty and I'm a not a Mini Van Mom driver anymore. I have the extra seats if I need to drive my kids friends. It gets great gas mileage, and so easy to get in and out of space?"
"08 21, 2011",Great Car,"In February 2011 I purchased a Toyota Rav4. So far I have been very pleased with the car except for two things 1) I cannot buckle the middle seat belt in the back seat. It has some sort of dual lock but even with the manual I can't see how it works. I think something is wrong with it. I am going to have to contact the dealer because no one I know can figure it out. Since we have the optional third row we have never needed to use that buckle yet. 2) I am not happy with the car doors, especially the back seat doors. You have to really slam them to get them to close tight on the first try and when they close (this applies to all the doors) it sounds like a tin can. The sound makes the car seem really cheap. If pressed to list any and all complaints I guess I would have to say that I dislike clock and the placement it, it makes the interior of the car look very dated to me. Although after having the car for a month or so I was completely used to it. Other than these few minor things (I will contact the dealer to fix or explain the seat belt) I really love the car. It has a nice smooth ride and so far it has been great."
"07 29, 2011",Exactly what I was looking for.,"I needed a family car with cargo room that still had some sportiness to it. The 2011 Rav4 met all of my needs, and made letting go of my beloved (and still running great) '99 Honda Prelude palatable."
"07 28, 2011",Affordible SUV,"Satisfied but new models should have:
1. six speed trans,
2. better seats with wider backs
3. better tires
4. Get better MPG"
"07 21, 2011",2011 Rav 4,An ok car but a little light on the bells and whistles for the money. Runs ok but a little rough compared to other small SUVs.
"07  8, 2011",Good Car,"It is a good car. I liked the third row seats. I can used it when I need. Otherwise, I can fold them down. I installed a navigation from Toyoter Service. I don't like the installed Navigation. It has some problems. Perhaps, Toyota's factory installed navigation is better."
"06  2, 2011",NICE CAR,"NICE SIZE SUV, HAS EVERY THING YOU WOULD NEED FOR COMFORT AND RIDE. HAS GOOD STYLING FOR ITS SIZE. VERY COMPETIVE IN ITS SIZE"
"05 30, 2011",Fall In Love again,"Love LOve LOVe LOVE this little suv! I am the mom of three grown boys(two still in college),when I get in my Rav4 and head down the road I feel 16 again. This car does anything I ask it to do. The only thing I can really complain about and it's very minor, when I close the door it sounds a little tinnie. It is a 4 cylinder front wheel drive and it has plenty of get up and go. I am very happy with my purchase just ask my kids. My three favorite things about my car are keyless entry, keyless start and the sunroof. I would highly recommend you give the Rav4 a try you just might fall in love again."
"05 27, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"Last car owned 2001 RAV4

Negatives: Stripping along side of car to prevent
other car doors damaging, is much,
much smaller and not well placed.

Gear shifting is complicated by manufac-
turer trying to give some semblence to a
standard transmission. Writer's first car
was a standard transmission.

Interior arrangement and seemingly un-
necessary placement of some operative
instrument are confusing. Once again,
the manufacturer is reaching out in des-
peration to make the newest model dif-
ferent. Too bad, the first few years the
models changed little if at all. It all be-
gan when they extended the body 14"",
playing havoc with the MPG and making
it difficult to park in a two car garage.

Toyota. You really going to print this?"
"05 20, 2011",Versatile and Fun,"Bought new 4x4 Limited with v6 in 2009. Have 43,000 miles on car. This is the best car I have ever owned and am still waiting for something to break!
Lightning fast, steady and quiet at 75mph, and great breaking. 26mpg at 75. 31mpg at 60mph.
I tow a small boat easily.
Seat are comfortable, back seat roomy, and storage a plenty. I like the spare outside to gain the interior room.
I also like the swing out rear door because I no longer hit my head on old mini van rear door.
JBL Sound system, blue tooth, sirius radio, and i pod plug in all work great."
"05 16, 2011",A very good car,"A fund car to drive and very peppy for a four cylinder
Model.a little less economy than advertise but still
Efficient."
"05 11, 2011",Greatest value for the money.,"I purchased the Sport model. It came with lots of extras including a six cylinder engine. The salesperson told me that the difference in gas mileage between the four cylinder and six cylinder engine is only one mile per gallon. I am impressed by the roominess inside. The height, width and depth of the driver's seat suits me perfectly. The steering wheel is adjustible as to the angle and space from the dash. The combination of ample room and adjustibility is perfect for driver comfort.

The six cylinder engine and four speed transmission results in responsive and smooth acceleration for interstate access. The cargo area is spacious and the flattening of the 2nd row seats is easy and can be controlled from the rear of the car.

I also appreciate the quiet cabin. Very little, if any, road or wind noise. The video screen that appears in the rear view mirror makes for safer backing than just the mirrors. All in all, I have no complaints and find it difficult to think of a single problem with this car."
"05  5, 2011",Perfect for me and grandkids,"I have the seven passenger Rav 4 and it is perfect for hauling my grandchildren around in, as three in car seats and one on the way to be in car seat, so had to have room, but yet wanted good gas mileage and this vehicle was exactly what I was looking for."
"04 30, 2011",Limited V-6 4WD,"Short front seats leads to backache & fatigue even on short trips on 5'9"" driver. Power tilt on driver side does not angle high enough at front of seat. V-6 jumpy on throttle from a stop. Limited rides stiffly over bumps and road reflectors. Versatile sliding, folding, reclining rear seat. Rear seat pull downs from the hatch area are useful. Navigation system is poor and couldn't get the JBL radio with the Nav. Oil change surprise on V-6 since the oil filter is paper and the filter itself costs $35-$50! After living with it, no longer satisfied."
"04 27, 2011","Comfortable, sporty, all around great","We were looking for a car that you could get in and out of easily (sits up higher) and this was the ticket! Also it is roomy without being extremely big.
Feels good from every aspect.
Very pleased."
"04 26, 2011",Great Car,"The V6 Rav4 is a great car - fast, fun to drive, easy to maneuver. The MP3 changer is great. I wish the steering mounted controls were standard on every trim - but it can be added afterwards without much trouble (people on RAV4 forums have done this). Mine has the 3rd row seats. They are small but usable for short trips around town. Only dislike on styling is the rear mounted spare tire - wish it were hidden like the CR-V."
"04 23, 2011",2011 RAV4 V6 4WD vs 2009 CRV EX AWD,"I traded in my 2009 Honda CR-V, EX, AWD on the 2011 Toyota RAV4, Limited, V6, 4WD. Both were bought new by me.
CRV Pros:
Better exterior looks.
Better seating comfort.
Lift hatchback rear door.
Feels like it has more interior room than RAV4.
CRV Cons:
Severely under powered for even routine driving.
RAV4 V6 Pros:
GREAT power!
Almost the same fuel milage as the 4 cyl CRV.
Twice the towing capacity.
Ability to lock in the 4WD manually (not available on CRV).
Climate control.
Full-size spare.
RAV4 V6 Cons:
The side opening rear door sucks!
The back seat is not sized for adults. The back rest height barely comes up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Definitely not sized for anything more than small children.
Very dated orange-yellow back lighting as opposed to the modern looking blue in the CRV.

For me, the three selling points for the RAV4 are the fantastic V6 with it's great power and MPG. The ability to manually lock-in the 4WD. And, it can tow more than the CRV.
I WOULD NOT buy the CRV because of the ridiculously under powered nature of the engine. It is horrible! However, if the CRV was available with the V6 similar to the RAV4 I would unquestionably buy the CRV over the RAV4.
I hope this helps someone considering the two SUVs."
"04  5, 2011",Very reliable car,"Big change from my old 2003 Rav4. Ride has improved and road noise is greatly reduced.
V6 engine runs smooth and much more power than the 4 cyl. engine."
"03 31, 2011",Best 4wd vehicle I have ever owned!,"Drives like a car while performing like an SUV. Simple, sturdy and reliable with a superb blend of attributes."
"03 27, 2011",merced toyota is the best,The RAV4 is a very different type of vehicle than the sedans and coupes previously owned. The RAV4 has great forward visibility. It feels bigger than it looks. The base model features are good.
"03 25, 2011",2011 RAV 4 review,"My second RAV4, a number of enhancements have been made on my LTD model since the 2007 model year I previously owned. The V6 is a great engine but my previous RAV had an annoying whine at 60 to 65 mph. Improvements in the electronically controlled transmission software have made the 2011 whisper quiet at these speeds. The smart key entry system works flawlessly and is great when you've got armfuls of stuff and can't fish the key out of your pocket. It even works when I'm wearing gloves. Zero squeaks or rattles, even in cold weather. V6 combined mileage has been in the 24 to 26 range, really good for a V6 4WD. Poor weather handling has been excellent, very stable on bad roads. No regrets in buying another one."
"03 22, 2011",Great Car,I had a Rav4 as a rental & decided to buy one. Best car I've ever owned & a good sized SUV for the city.
"03 22, 2011",Great in Snow & Ice,RAV4 handles well in the poorest of road conditions. Gives the driver the confidence in the cars ability to get you to your destination. Wind noise with rear windows cracked or open is quite annoying. Standard drivers seat can get uncomfortable. Rear window seems to get dirty quite easily. GREAT forward visability!
"03 14, 2011",Great car,"We recently sold our 2002 4Runner and bought a 2011 RAV4 sport. We look the outside and the intrerior is very well designed. The seats are comfortable and the interior has ample room for everything we need to fit, including the 2 car seats we'll be putting in later this year when our twins arrive. Ample power as the 179 hp is only slightly less than the '02 4Runner V6. It sips gas for an SUV."
"03 12, 2011",RAV4 Then and Now 2002-2011,Owned a 2002 RAV4 before buying this 2011 version. The new model is around 20% bigger and this change has more of an impact than I thought it would. On the plus side there is a lot more cargo room with or without the back seats folded down (I did not get the third row seat version) and more head room for taller passengers. On the minus side this is now a mid to large SUV so no more squeezing into the only tight parking spot left. I miss the ability I had with my 2002 version of taking out the rear seats for more cargo room and better gas mileage. However with the 2011 you get an extra glove box shelf and a variety of driver seat adjustments. Over all I like the new car and like anything new it takes some getting used to.
"03  8, 2011",the best,I am completely satisfied with the Rav SPORT model for 2011 Styling and comfort as well as satellite radio -best Toyota I have ever owned.
"03  5, 2011",2011 Toyota RAV4,"I love the car so far. It's quiet yet responsive. I have driven it in the snow and heavy rain. The Interiers are easy to use and all needed. Handling is great.

However, shouldn't the XM radio subscription come free with the deal, rather than just 3 months?"
"03  5, 2011",Great vehicle,I have the v6 model and it has great power along with shure footed in snow. Lots of room inside and a comfortable ride.
"03  1, 2011",the car that exceeded my expectations,"I wanted a compact SUV that gets good gas mileage,has a third row seat for my kids and comes in red!Did my research and came up with the RAV4 that I've been eyeing for a couple years already for its looks. We found one in a neighboring state and picked it up without even test driving it.No regrets as the Limited V6 has awesome acceleration!Talk about zoom,zoom!I live in Reno and its been great in the snow.My fellow musicians are in awe of the JBL speakers too."
"02 22, 2011",Glad I bought it!,"I bought this vehicle just as the snows descended on New England. I couldn't get this car to slip or slide! The V6 has ample horsepower, tranny shifts smoothly, butter-soft acceleration. I hope to keep it a very long time..."
"01 29, 2011",Bumpy ride,This SUV does not have the smoothest ride. You feel every bump on the road. It makes me wish I bought a regular car for a better ride. I wouldn't buy another one. I should have checked out the Honda's.
"12 30, 2010",I LOVE my new Rav4,"After 14 years as a Camry owner, I am a real Toyota believer. Even with the bad publicity Toyota endured earlier in 2010, I was not swayed from their product lines. However, I did want to sit up higher and have more visibility, so I decided to check out the Rav4 Limited, and I can't be happier with my decision. For once, I did not stint on the options, and already I am loving the heated leather seats (the cold winter in NYC so far has allowed me to really appreciate them) and the stereo system is fantastic. But the ride is the best - smooth, powerful, and pretty economical on the gas (though a bit less than the Camry, its true). I love the styling both outside and in, and feel I am a king in my new car."
"12  6, 2010",Rav4 for Mom,Mom loves it. Not the car for me but for her it is perfect. She lives in Colorado and it works great in the snow.
"12 30, 2023",Great value in a dependable fun used car,"We bought a 2011 AWD base model for our daughter just as the pandemic was starting. Three years later it has 120,000 miles on it and runs flawlessly. I just put on new shocks and struts and it rides like new. The driver side front axle seal needed replacement. The V6 has power to spare even in the mountain west, and makes it fun to drive. It's now worth a bit more than we paid for it."
"11  4, 2023",Still runs great!,"This is the best, most reliable car I have ever owned. Other than seals on the rear differential, I have done nothing to the car, other than brakes and routine maintenance. We have 157000 miles on it and it runs like new."
"11 23, 2022",2011 Toyota rav 4,I bought this vehicle used. Grinds when you go 30 miles an hour I want to know if there is recalls on vehicle and how to get them
"06 13, 2021",Best vehicle I have ever owned,"It is spacious, very comfortable more especially long distance. 
I still prefer this model in terms of looks as opposed to new models.
It is very low maintenance. I just love it"
"05 13, 2021","I love this car, so much!","This car, “Angel” is her name, is such a wonderful car, I just love it so much. I purchased it from a previous owner who had purchased it brand new when it came out but only drove it from home to a train station parking lot and then back home, the entire time. It had about 60k  miles on it and was in stellar condition. I just had to buy all new tires and just replaced the battery, last month. 

When I bought it in 2020, I was elated to have just found such a grand deal and my word, it has lived up to my expectations and then some. It’s so easy to drive. It is very comfortable, inside, the trunk and storage room back there is ample and with optimal care ( I take great care of this car, no slacking) it runs like a dream. 

Gas mileage is pretty good. I use ‘Plus’ gas in it. During a recent drive from Jersey to SC and back,  I filled up approx. every 4 hours at 1/4 tank left but yeah, I drove and opened that baby up like she’s never seen and quite frankly, it feels like it drives even better now, after that trip.

I love this car. It’s just big enough for me and stylishly speaking, it’s super cute. The only thing is that I’m a ‘sunroof’ person. My very first car had a sunroof and I’ve loved them ever since but I get enough sun and light through all of this cars windows so, well, that’s my only wish. 

Anyway, did I say ‘I love this car’, already? She is a dreamboat and I will drive her and care for her until she takes her last trek and breath :)
Adventure; we’ve got a lot to get into."
"01  7, 2021",Wouldn’t want any other car to be my first!,"The performance on this car is fantastic, from great gas miles and the smooth V6 engine, this car is runs great. Comfortable interior, very spacious and you don’t feel every bump in the road. Extra under storage in the trunk is so convenient. Feels very safe to be in as well. Only issue is back seat tracks are rusted from previous owner not cleaning water from a storm of the metal properly after leaving windows open, so they squeak when going over bumps. Other than that, I love my Rav4!"
"12 12, 2020",Great driving vehicle!,The RAV4 drives excellent! I now own 4 Toyotas! I absolutely love them! This is my first RAV4. It drives great and handles even better!
"11  9, 2020","I've enjoyed my RAV4, it takes me where I want","It is attractive, reliable, handles well and has never failed me.  I like the wheel on the back because I can find it in the parking lot"
"06 22, 2020",Spacious for a compact.,"Very impressed with the turning radius and the ease at which the engine tackles hills and speed. Very comfortable, and the air works very well. The back has plenty of room to pack my stuff. I do wish this vehicle had a tire on the back like the 12 that I saw, but that might just be an optional feature."
"06 12, 2020",Most reliable car I've ever had.,"My car has made me feel safe when I'm driving anywhere, especially in the winter times. When I decide to buy another car it will be a Toyota."
"06  8, 2020",Dependable and good all around.,"This car has a strong V6, good fuel economy, decent comfort and durability, and looks good.  Radio interface is far outdated but JBL speakers sound great.  Shock boots tear and lead to some squeaking but no major issues.  Maintenance is easy and inexpensive."
"06  1, 2020",21 MPG city 28 MPG highway,"4th Toyota RAV I owned over the years, fully loaded & detailed! Best SUV on the road, safety, durability & lasting! I have 2019 & 2020 also. Never uses a drop of oil between changes."
"04 26, 2020",Excellent vehicle,"One of the best vehicles for Midwest, with AWD option it is same good for    highway, off road or winter driving. With 2.5 L 4 cylinder engine has a very good gas mileage."
"03 15, 2020",I love this car.,"This isn't the fanciest car in the world, but it is perfect for me. It is easy to park and is peppy enough to merge into traffic, and easy to get in and out of and there is lots of space for dogs, shopping, and all the crap I haul around. And, it gets decent gas milage. My favorite thing is the good visibility I have when driving."

"02  2, 2020",Drove for 60k miles and its great!,"Great car for all weather and terrains. Even with the base model, the capabilities of this car are still great almost ten years later. Drives great and have never had issues with traction in winter or on wet roads. Cheap to maintain and handles great!"
"12 25, 2019",Smooth ride and reliable,Blue tooth ready has 3rd row seating lots of leg room heated seats push button engine start roomy cargo area great for hauling lumber supplies
"12 11, 2019",My 1st car I have ever owned,"This Rav4 car did everything it was asked of and more by my family, my friends, And I. This car has more than enough room to carry a full-size double refrigerator or eight people. It great on gas mileage as well"
"11 24, 2019",Like a Timex,"4 wheel drive a major plus. Just 7 "" ground clearance, but it isn't a Wrangler.

Interior lights are TOO DIM. Have a flashlight handy. 

Good milage, easy maintenance."
"11  9, 2019",Very cheap on gas and comfortable driving.,The car has a lot of room and easy on gas. Very reliable and no issues with the car. Just Keep it maintained and will last long.
"09 14, 2019",Seems reliable but not impressed,"After 8 years, only 57000 miles, several recalls, local Toyota dealer refused to service vehicle or provide warranty recalls after purchase,  dealer refused to provide oil changes per contract and national Toyota advertisement - told me they did not realize it was expensive 0W-20 synthetic oil ( this was in 2011), Bluetooth is calls only, front cup holders do not hold taller cups, drives like go-cart  (steering is very sensitive), rough noisy  ride, things are glitchy - Bluetooth sometimes go out, back up camera sometimes goes out but mine is NOT included in the national recall, front left window makes loud cracking noise when going up, seats front and rear are not comfortable, front windshield has been replaced 3 times in 3 years - prone to damage,  original tires were the worst replaced at 25,000 miles,  difficulty getting replacement parts,  cowel on rear wheels sticks out 1/2"" and gets pitted by rocks - looks bad.  I do not want another Toyota."
"09 13, 2019",A great car at a great price.,"Comfortable, fun, and Toyota reliability. Very spacious for a small SUV.  Easy to maintain, and handles great. A great car for the price, I could not recommend it more."
"09  7, 2019",Best car I have ever owned,"My wife loved this car because it is easy to get in and out of, it has heated seats, and really ll good on gas."

"04 26, 2019",It has been very reliable so far.,This car has met all my expectations. Love the way it handles the road. The ride is great compare to all cars I tested.  Still looks good for being a used car.
"04 18, 2019",Love my car. Hate constant dash lights,"For last five  years, my dashboard on my 2011 Toyota RAV 4 has had check engine, four wheel drive, and traction control lights on. At inspection time, we spend $95 for a machine to tell us that the O2 sensor needs replacing and $80 for a new sensor. 19 to 20 miles after we get the sticker, the dash lights come back on and stay that way for another year. We just paid $80 for a different sensor before going to get a sticker and lights didn’t stay off long enough to get to a garage to get inspected. Called Downeast Toyota in Brewer where we bought the car and it will cost another $95 to have the diagnostic machine tell us the same thing again. Fed up is the least of my feelings."
"02  5, 2019",Back To Toyota For Reliability,"A sporty little ride. Basic and no-frills, but gets from Point A to Point B. Good on gas, and with some snow tires added will go where I need to go."
"01  9, 2019",Best Car Purchase in Years,I am very happy with this car.  It has the distinct body styling I prefer and has handled well even in the ice and snow.  I find it easy to drive and reminds me of my classic 1999 Honda CRV (which I would clone if I could).
"12 16, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"Excellent car but 2 main issues one the AC not good , and two the breaks keeps tearing off fast and not that strong as Nissan but have no idea about other Toyota models but over all Toyota cars n trucks are 100% reliable and re selling value cars"

"11 30, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"A comfortable ride, plenty of room for transporting people from place to place. Great for going camping in the mountains, and lots of room for camping equipment."
"11 26, 2018",A Good Buy for the Money,"I purchased the Rav 4 because (1) it is a Toyota and (2) it has low mileage for a 2011 vehicle 26,000 miles). I wanted a small SUV with low mileage, a great reputation for reliability, a full size spare tire, 4 wheel drive, , attractiveness, and fuel economy.  I was actually looking for a V6 but settled for a 4 cylinder (2.5 liter) since I would get better fuel economy."
"11 22, 2018","Bought new . Now rav has 45,000 mi. Never failed .","In 45,000 miles the rav has never failed to get me where I was going . Last month my city had a flood . I had to go get my 3rd grader from school asap. The streets over near the school were pretty deep in some spots . The 2 wheel drive 4 cyl. Rav when right through the water , although I was worried about it drowning out . Rav got us home without a sputter. Lots of things I like about rav , most of all she?s paid for ,lol ."

I want a new car but it will be hard to let the rav4 go. Therefore I am not looking for a car.
I am loyal to Toyota rav4"
"04 29, 2018",First AWD I've owned,This car is great. The AWD also has the 4 wheel lock so I can feel confident getting out in the rain and snow. I live a mile from a blacktop road so this gives me peace of mind. The RAV4 has plenty of room for passengers as well as a cargo area. The seats are comfortable and there's a lot of legroom. With multiple storage compartments there's no cramming everything into a single glove box. The car is easy to get in and out of which is really nice when I'm feeling my age. I love the side opening rear door instead of a hatchback.
"04  7, 2018",very reliable and sturdy,"bought it for my twins got them through high school and college and never let us down.
very dependable and reliable . very good in the snow and ice also if you get the 4 wheel drive version"

"10 27, 2017",Low mileage car for great price!,"This car is a real GEM! Only 31,500 miles on it.  Newer Tires and Battery. Very clean inside and out.

"09  8, 2017",First comfortable car I've owned,I looked at many vehicles and this was the only one that fit me good.  As a short person I am able to put the seat up enough to reach the pedals without feeling to close to the steering wheel and after breaking my back this SUV is very comfortable.  I love all the features it comes with.  I'm very satisfied with this vehicle and would recommend it to all my friends.
"09  7, 2017",Nice car,"Great little SUV.  27 mpg+, quiet, loads of interior space.  Tailgate mounted swinging spare tire is a drawback."
"09  7, 2017",Best SUV,I've owned a couple of older RAV4's and absolutely love them!  You can't beat Toyota for reliability and performance. If I had to pick only one all around car to own it would an older model RAV.
"09  6, 2017",great price   good value,"I Love this car       Great in the snow and bad weather .   Superb power yet great fuel economy, huge cargo space with flat load floor and low load height,,,comfortable ride"
"08 18, 2017","Great value, very dependable!","Best money I have ever spent. I have driven this car 140,000 miles in 5 years and only have had to replace brakes, tires and oil! The V6 is very strong and efficient."
"08 17, 2017",Smooth stylish ride!,"I absolutely love my Toyota Rav4 it's comfortable for my whole family and drives smoothly and quietly! You do have to be careful with the transmission fluid if it's low or too full it will shift a little rough from reverse to drive but if you have just the right amount it is smooth as can be. I was very surprised by the trunk space for this smaller suv but having the spare tire on the tailgate makes all the difference, I am excited to play with this car in the snow and se how it does!"
"08  6, 2017",very reliable,Fun to drive. I feel safe and comfortable.  It is easy to dive. I have no blind spots.  Good ac and stereo.
"08  4, 2017",Love love love my RAV 4,"I own two Toyota RAV4 4's, a 2011 and a 2009. They are both work horses. V6 gives me the power to tow, and enough torque to quickly accelerate onto the highway. I was not a fan of the newer 4 cylinder versions so I have purchased two of the older V6 (no longer produced).  One of these was purchased due to storage room in the back end for my son that is a Hockey Goalie and he hauls a lot of large gear."
"08  2, 2017","Comfort, style, economy","Love my used RAV4! So comfortable and stylish, roomy and great on gas! Plenty of room and easy to drive. And so many extra touches!"
"08  1, 2017",A very dependable utility buggy,This is a great car - SUV- or whatever you want to call it. It's very dependable and useful. The cargo area is deceptively large when the back seat is folded down. I've been able to carry a small couch in there. I also got a double bed to fit one day. This is a super useful vehicle.
"07 18, 2017","Sporty, great handling, holds everything I need!",This SUV holds much more than I expected. Handles great in snow/ice. Big enough for three adults to sit comfortably in the back seat.
"07 12, 2017",Rock solid reliability!,"Solid, smooth engine. A little underpowered with the 4 cylinder and 4wd. The transmission is very smooth. It is awesome in snow and averages 22 mpg city. My only complaint would be the highway fuel mileage. Manufacturer claims 27 on highway. Best I've seen is 26, but usually average 24-25. I guess it's because it only a 4 speed transmission."
"07 12, 2017",Best car for the money,The nicest used car I've ever owned it rides and handles really sporty for being an suv I would recommend this car to anyone.
"07  9, 2017",Reliability is outstanding for all road conditions,"Well thought out vehicle for real life atmosphere that people encounter everyday. Suspension is great, very reliable and drives smooth. Wasn't a fan of Toyota. Now that I bought one. Very impressed with the performance that I see in the vehicle. 4x4 is great. Engineering in vehicle is well planned and would think it took the simplest thought of what you wished or wanted out of a vehicle.  Especially in bad weather or bad road conditions."
"07  8, 2017",Second of 2 Ravs.,"This vehicle meets all my needs. Great style, comfort and handling. Just the right size for our needs."
"06 15, 2017",Graduated to Rav 4 after 20 years in Sienns,My kids are all grown and I was ready for something fun and less mom. I found that in the Rav 4!! It's zippier than a minivan but still has the compact feel of a car. I love the look and drive but do wish the seats were a bit comfier.
"06  1, 2017",Nicest Upgrade in Several Years,"Was looking for an AWD SUV that would fit the short space available in my garage.  This RAV4 had almost all the options I sought, good cargo room, fair power (for a 4 cyl), and feels good in the driver's seat.  Front passenger seat not as comfortable because it doesn't have the height adjust like driver's.  Only had this car a couple weeks, so reliability rating is of previous Toyota experience.  Used to be a GM person, but Toyota and Honda both have both won me over from several of the recent GM I've worked on or driven."
"05 14, 2017",Kgorkin,Best vehicle I have owned.  No issues keep the maintenance up and it will run forever. Geat in the snow plenty of power. Thhe 3rd generation is the one to have. My wfe has a 2013 4th gen we like the old one better.
"05 10, 2017",Perfect Compact SUV,This is a great lil SUV. Holds 4 adults fairly comfortably and the one we have has all the options so that makes the ride even better.
"04  6, 2017",Reliable !,Very reliable with the plenty of power V6 option available. In the RAV4 sport that we own it has great power and great torque to do what we need to do and go where we need to go with the all wheel drive
"03 28, 2017",As expected and a little more,"Toyota has built a great reputation and I expected the RAV4 to follow suit. Luxury was not what I was looking for, but functionality. Visibility is great in this car, it has lots of room and has a lot more pep from its four cylinder than my '05 Escape with a V6. Trivial items like the floor shifter stem looks ""thin"", the ""headlights are on"" dash indicator light a little bright and the driver's seat seatbelt receptacle too low, but nothing of extreme annoyance. I enjoy driving this car."
"03 28, 2017",Great car for distance comfortable and good on gas,Toyota makes a great reliable car that has excellent gas mileage . The Toyota Rav 4 is great for travel and vacations. Lots of room for luggage and passengers. I would recommend this car to all my family and friends.
"03 28, 2017",RAV4 overview,Stylish and practical with good value for the money. Only drawback is the seats not comfortable enough.
"03 24, 2017",Another reliable Toyota,"I have owned numerous cars but my Toyota Sienna was by far the most reliable and cheapest vehicle to maintain. When I was in the market for a replacement vehicle I went right for the Toyota again only this time I don't need minivan as my kids are grown.
The Rav 4 drives lovely, is trying and has a lot of features that make driving comfortable and convenient!  So far I love everything about it and I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it like I did my Sienna."
"03 21, 2017",the word dependable and that no lie,I wake in the morning that all is good with  this rav4. they build convince in there cars and faith that is my the best for my family.
"03 15, 2017",Toyota Rav4 2011,Its a confort car and Smoth and is safe and thanks form the saler Juan Gamara for his excelent atention
"03 13, 2017",Great Value,"This car gets great gas millage, has good cargo capacity, and very reliable all for an affordable price."
"03  9, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"I just purchased this vehicle.  It was highly recommended to me.  It's comfort, performance, exterior styling, interior design all deserve a 5* rating, as well as value for the money and reliability.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"12 11, 2016",I love it,"This is my second RAV4 and I've loved them both! Good looking, smooth ride, lots of space. Toyota is reliable and I plan on driving this for a long time."
"11 24, 2016",2011 Rav 4,Always enjoyed this brand   Rav 4  is a good SUV style for a reasonable price and gas mileage.  I recommend to anyone looking to get out of a car and into something a little different
"01  8, 2016",Wilfredo Vega Best Sales Associate,"Thank you for everything, we appreciate everything that you have helped me with. I didn't have great credit but you managed a way for me to make it work! I have a great car thanks to Wilfredo Vega, sales and leasing consultant.

Thank you from Mr. and Mrs. Ventura"
"09  9, 2014",Reliable and comfortable,I purchased the car few months back and I have good experience. I am really enjoying the SUV drive. I like the pick up. Most of the times i have issues in the Cruise control speed adjusting sometimes it takes huge pickup suddenly kind of jerk. Everything is good but I see few things especially the suspension is not as good as it is. Rear Seats are comfortable only for two and if third person sits then it would be congested.
"03 28, 2014",Best Small SUV I've Owned!,"I've owned an Isuzu Trooper II, Jeep Liberty, Jeep Cherokee, and a Honda CRV. THis little gem is by far my favorite. I'm short, so the adjustable driver's seat and steering wheel are a huge plus for me. It handles like a dream and has a peppy pick-up. I have the leather package and sunroof, and it gives it a sporty feel.
It rains a lot in New Orleans, and our streets aren't the smoothest, which is why I drive SUVs. This little baby is a dream for these conditions. The back seat has ample leg room, and the controls are within easy reach. I love it."
"12  7, 2013",Everything I expected and more,"We recently purchased a 2011 Toyota RAV 4 sport from Toyota of Manhattan and really love the car, and we also had a very pleasant experience with all of the staff at the dealership, very knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. This is our first 4 wheel drive vehicle and much to my surprise we are getting slightly better MPG than our other SUV that we traded in. I also have slightly more cargo space than I did before and the car is very comfortable and handles very well. I've owned many Toyotas and have never been disappointed with their products, it looks like we found another quality car that will serve us well for many years to come."
"11  1, 2013",Watch for paint issues,"I have paint coming off of the roof between the windshield and sunroof. I showed this to the dealer and they raised the issue to Toyota. Since the car has over the 36K miles warrantee I was simply told they don't care and it was not their problem. The car is less than 36 months old and because of my job I have to put on more miles. You will notice paint issues. The depth of paint varies on the roof from the rest of the car as measured at the dealership.
Realize that there is NO advantage to having a Toyota over any of the other manufacturers. The quality is not better nor is the service."
"06 30, 2013",Great smaller alternative to the Highlander,"I traded my highlander for the rav4. Yes, smaller and less room, but gas mileage, reliability, small easy to maneuver...worth the trade. Tough at first, I lived my highlander, but w gas priced and no longer needing the extra room, I'm very happy w the trade. Mine is the bade model e the ESV pkg...I.e. moonroof, bigger nicer rims and tires, 6 CDplayer. ONE BAD THING...huge for me,maybe not for you. The radio stinks!!! DDoesn't go anywhere near adas loud as my highlander. I'm learning to live w it. Oh yeah, I bought used and the person before added a Bluetooth. Love this!!! If you don't have one, get one. Worth every penny!!!"
"06 23, 2013",Quite happy with it!,It's only been a month since I got my used RAV4. So far I am very happy with it. I would recommend it to someone with a brain injury or with depth perception problems. After years in a lower car I feel I have better command of the road.
"06 19, 2013",good car,this is a good car for me and my freinds and family i only use it in the snowing months. with winter in this area . it has all wheal drive.
"04 17, 2013",Best and Safest car my daughter has ever had,"This 2011 RAV4 replaces a 2004 RAV4 with 166,000 miles that was in an accident and totalled, the 2004 was still in great shape and trouble free. This 2011 RAV4 is a phenomenal car, great value, great inside and outside styling, the 4 cylinder engine is economical and peppy, the 4 speed automatic transmission is smooth, the 4 wheel disc brakes stop great, the AWD system is flawless, seats are comfortable, the inside space is great, the comfort features are wonderful, this RAV4 has the Run Flat tires that ride a little harsh but convenient in case of a flat, the moon/sunroof is a treat and the multi-CD radio sounds great. If you're looking for a small AWD SUV, this is such a great choice, not the most luxurious but such a great value, I'll buy another RAV4 anytime without hesitation."
"01 26, 2013",Quality with power and excellent mileage.,"Smooth power, spacious, comfortable, and extremely well built. Handles well and easy to get into. Fully featured. Only wish it had 6 or 7 speed transmission which would probably help produce better gas mileage. Still satisfied with the mileage considering the horse power this car has. Would recomend to friends and family"
"12 25, 2012",Have to wait and see how it works..just bought it,Loooks good so far................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
"08 14, 2012",BUTNING RAV4 SPORT,"Ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy, it?s not a family car. I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. It burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 2 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's not too bad. Now I just add oil every other month, after 4-recall I think I made a big mistake buying the RAV4."
"06 26, 2012",New Toyota rav 4Limited nice ride,"This limited Rav4 has leather moon roof power heated seats etc;I love the appearance,the ride and performance of this vehicle.I am glad I bought the v6 the engine it is smooth and quiet.The storng acceleration and performance is worth the extrta money. the gas mileage of mixed driving in hilly terrain is 23mpg. I am anxious to take it on A trip. I only have 1200 miles.The ext. is Blizzard Pearl,with tan leather and a tan pin stripe. The 4 cylinder performance was adequate , but not fun to drive like the v6."
"06  4, 2012",Nice suv,"Nice small SUV. Still gives the ""feel"" of a bigger and taller SUV, but compact...seems nearly as large inside as my 2003 Highlander."
"05 14, 2012",My 2011 Rav4 V6 sport,"After I purchased my 2011 Rav V6 sport there was a rattling noise coming from the moonroof that was horribly ruining my early ownership experience. Dealer kept the car three days and managed to replace the wind deflector but even with the new wind deflector on the noise was still there although not as loud as before. It's been one month and a half and I am realizing that the drive shaft whines considerably loud at low speeds(30-45 mph). I am definitely having that looked but the car had only 7300 miles on it when I bought it and it is bothering me to the point I would not consider buying used anymore. There is only one thing I will have to say that the V6 is strong and fast and that the car is pretty good looking too, compare to the competition. The fact that it is a Sport model and comes with tuned suspension makes the ride harsh and stiff. You may consider that prior to purchasing. Bottom line, Toyota lacks bells and whistles so if you are into technology, innovation, and interior quality, today's Rav4 does not offer anything exciting. Reliability has also dropped in my opinion since this is the second Rav I own. I am sorry but it is just a plain car that has lost its vision and more importantly has forgotten what sport really means."
"04 17, 2012",2011 Rav 4,"Excellent styling. The performance of the v-6 is also excellent. I've been driving on snow and ice. The ABS, 4WD, and the stock all weather 18"" tires work very well together."
"03 30, 2012",I love the 6 cyl. zip!,"I've owned the RAV4 for a year now & do daily commuting & the occasional long road trip. I wish the gas mileage was better, but I like the extra power of the V-6; it has a smooth ride & good handling. There are lots of extra features I enjoy (heated seats, 4WD, back up cam, sunroof) & the styling is reasonable but not flashy. A nice, solid vehicle."
"03  4, 2012",2011 RAV4 4cyl. 4x4 OK but disappointed,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. engine 4x4. This was purchased as my mom's golden years vehicle. She wanted something she could see out of, was up high/easy to get in and out of, small-ish and got good gas mileage. Also, all the bells and whistles my dad refused to get in the past, so she chose an almost fully loaded Limited model.

Went with 4 cylinder engine to maximize MPG, but my area is short on front wheel drive 'Limited' models, so ended up with the 4 wheel drive. At the time of purchase, Toyota.com said 2 wheel drive models were not available for sale in my area (Md.). I don't know if this was due to the tsunami or just a regular sales decision.

There is no hill-holder or hill brake on the automatic transmission in the 4 cylinder model, so when you start on a steep hill the car rolls back like a manual transmission car. Really unnerves my mom. She tries to avoid hills. I've heard the hill brake may be an option (?) you can purchase, but seeing as she bought a Limited version and it didn't come with it, I doubt it. Maybe the front wheel drive only version has it? The V-6 does have it. We didn't encounter any substantial hills on our test drives so it didn't appear to be as rolly as it really is on big hills.

The gas mileage is awful for old lady drivers. My mom's short 2-5 mile stop-sign racing at 25-35 mph speeds result in 16-17mpg. But, one trip over 10 miles on the highway will bump the average to over 20mpg, but still nowhere near the big print advertised mileage, much closer to the small low end fine print mileage for the V-6. The ""break in period"" is bogus. Did average 28-30 mpg on a long interstate trip, but we cared more about the around town mileage.

I am 6'3"" and I find the seats to be slightly off. Seat bottoms are not quite wide enough or long enough, but it's not my car. But, at least your almost level with your co-pilot versus the Subaru Forester where the co-pilot sits down in a hole with the dash board at eye level. Overall, you can't beat the room available in the RAV4. Very roomy front and back. Oh, we only got the 2 rows of seats.

As most everyone notes, the swing out tailgate is not great, but you can learn to work with it. Only thing you can't work around is when it's raining; you don't have any cover and the rain just goes right in the back.

Overall the RAV4 is a great vehicle. The 4 cylinder has a lot of pep. More than enough to get you moving. Ride is tops for the type of vehicle, but by no means smooth or sedan-like. Wind and road noise is quieter than CR-V, but not as quiet as a sedan. Speaking of the CR-V, the RAV4 doesn't have any strong vibrations through the steering wheel when stopped at a light like the CR-V. That was a bit unnerving on our CR-V test drives. You'd be sitting at a light and it would just vibrate your arms. I think it was tied to the power steering and A/C system. Anyways, one of the cons for the CR-V that led to the RAV4 purchase. The interior details are great in the RAV4: cup holders, outlets, folding seats, sliding seats, armrest and glove boxes. The only other thing I don't like are the LCD displays. They look dated and detract from the style of the interior. A quibble, but eh..."
"01 30, 2012",First time Toyota Suv,"Engine...(4 cyl) transmission a little noisy when accelerating. But has plenty of power for 4 cyl.

Looks....Clean and Sharp exterior, interior space is the most available in small Sub class. seats have been comfortable on trips and general driving.

Radio....I don't Like not as good sounding as I would have e
Xspected..

Price......base model $ 21,000

I would recommend this vehicle 4-5 stars."
"01  3, 2012",Disappointed,"We own a 2011 4 cylinder front wheel drive RAV-4. The gas milage is not as good as we expected. We get about 20 per gallon in the city and 25 on the highway.
Three times in two months the SUV engine raced and jumped while we were backing up. Toyta kept the car for three days and could not reproduce the issue.
This is our third Toyota SUV and our last. Toyota SUV's are not as reliable as their sedans. Toyota SUV's are not woth the price!"
"01  2, 2012",just breaking it in,"I like the way the car handles, the gas mileage is up and down, I have owned it for two months now, I have 2000 miles on it. I have not gotten more then 23 MPG at the highest and 18 MPG lowest. I have not driven more then 100 miles at a stretch on the highway. I am hoping it works itself into better MPG. I don't like the light color of cloth on interior doors. It really shows dirt and stains easily . other then this, I really like the car. It is
4 cylinder 4wd. It has power, for a 4 cylinder."
"12 27, 2011","New 2011 RAV4, LIMITED, Experience","Purchased the LIMITED V6 4x4 in Pacific Blue fully loaded with the exception of navigation. Since I own a Garmin, no sense in having both. JBL + Bluetooth, leather, tint, tow + more! Don't drive a V6 because you will ultimately buy it! Very comfortable ride although thirsty in the city with around 17-18 mpg around town, which is not too bad. No long trips yet, but should get 22 + even with weight of 4x4 and engine. Interior is good, but would have liked some upgrade in materials, however nicely crafted and roomy. Towing will be easy with the tow package and powerful engine. Little to no changes in 2012. Buy at end of month for good deal. Used prices are high so I opted for new, since they hold their value well. Not cheap, but all the vehicle one would need for travel, sport, etc."
"12 26, 2011",2011 RAV4,Solid basic small SUV. No real frills but it is reliable. Averaging 25 MPG city and 26.5 highway. Only compliant-road noise.
"12 23, 2011",new to toyota,"After much research..alot done on cars.com, I went with the Rav 4...based on reviews and material that I read. So far I am very happy with my choice...the 4 cylinder impresses me with its power and ease..the vehicle feels safe and solid...my last SUV was a 2000 Explorer and this is far superior in every way."
"12 13, 2011",Great Machine,"Great car for the money. V-6 motor and transmission combination better than before. Leather and options definitely make the car more enjoyable. Still has the dopey dashboard and odd interior design choices, but lots of SUV for the money. Anything else is $3,000-$5,000 more for the power and options."
"12  6, 2011",Excellent ride,When shopping I drove every 4 cyl all wheel drive car on the market. Rav4 was my first ride and ended going back and buying. Excellent handling and gas milage isn't bad either. I would reccommend to any one looking for an all wheel drive vehicle
"11 17, 2011",MOST DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AROUND.,"I OWNED A TOYOTA CAMARY FROM 1989 UNTIL 1999 AND IT STILL WAS DEPENDABLE AT 200,000 MILES AND THE NEXT VEHICLE I BOUGHT WAS A TOYOTA RAV. 4, 1999 MODEL AND STILL OWN IT WITH 155,000 MILES AND IT STILL DRIVES GREAT. YOU CAN'T BEAT THIS VEHICLE FOR COMFORT, RELIABILITY, GOOD LOOKING, SPACIOUS, AND KEEPS ON TICKING. LOVE TOYOTA"
"11 15, 2011",Just what I wanted,This is an excellent car. It's exactly what I was looking for. I go on a lot of road trips so I wanted 4 wheel drive and a lot of cargo room. This car definitely has both. It is very reliable and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend it.
"10 17, 2011",The Do Everything Vehicle,"We have the 2011 V6 Limited version with most of the extras except the navigation tool. Great gas mileage, great response on the highway, turns on a dime and extremely responsive. From the outside it appears quite compact. I have taken 80"" doors in for repair, transported a 5' bathtub from Home Depot to our home. Taken grandkids on various trips, 4 golfers including myself with all our gear. Looks good, rides great, never a fear of it not performing as advertised when we purchased it."
"10  4, 2011",Rav4,"We drove the Rav to Austin, TX and back to Seattle roundtrip of over 6000 miles. The ride was comfortable and enjoyable!"
"09 27, 2011",Great car,"We bought the RAV4 4 wheel drive V6. Incredibly, it gets better mileage than my Honda CRV even though the RAV4 has far superior performance. It also has more cargo space and a quieter ride. THe radio is quite good.
THe only cons include an annoying squeak in the dashboard and the inferior tires that they equip the car with that we were warned would not last for too long. THe tires are Bridgestone Duelers.
This is one sweet ride and I expect it to handle our harsh winters well once we get better tires on it for winter driving.

One other con relates to the fact that the car which cost a considerable amount does not include floor mats which to me is shocking."
"08 26, 2011",First Toyota,"I have always owned Hondas and I love the look and the way the Toyota drives. It is sporty and I'm a not a Mini Van Mom driver anymore. I have the extra seats if I need to drive my kids friends. It gets great gas mileage, and so easy to get in and out of space?"
"08 21, 2011",Great Car,"In February 2011 I purchased a Toyota Rav4. So far I have been very pleased with the car except for two things 1) I cannot buckle the middle seat belt in the back seat. It has some sort of dual lock but even with the manual I can't see how it works. I think something is wrong with it. I am going to have to contact the dealer because no one I know can figure it out. Since we have the optional third row we have never needed to use that buckle yet. 2) I am not happy with the car doors, especially the back seat doors. You have to really slam them to get them to close tight on the first try and when they close (this applies to all the doors) it sounds like a tin can. The sound makes the car seem really cheap. If pressed to list any and all complaints I guess I would have to say that I dislike clock and the placement it, it makes the interior of the car look very dated to me. Although after having the car for a month or so I was completely used to it. Other than these few minor things (I will contact the dealer to fix or explain the seat belt) I really love the car. It has a nice smooth ride and so far it has been great."
"07 29, 2011",Exactly what I was looking for.,"I needed a family car with cargo room that still had some sportiness to it. The 2011 Rav4 met all of my needs, and made letting go of my beloved (and still running great) '99 Honda Prelude palatable."
"07 28, 2011",Affordible SUV,"Satisfied but new models should have:
1. six speed trans,
2. better seats with wider backs
3. better tires
4. Get better MPG"
"07 21, 2011",2011 Rav 4,An ok car but a little light on the bells and whistles for the money. Runs ok but a little rough compared to other small SUVs.
"07  8, 2011",Good Car,"It is a good car. I liked the third row seats. I can used it when I need. Otherwise, I can fold them down. I installed a navigation from Toyoter Service. I don't like the installed Navigation. It has some problems. Perhaps, Toyota's factory installed navigation is better."
"06  2, 2011",NICE CAR,"NICE SIZE SUV, HAS EVERY THING YOU WOULD NEED FOR COMFORT AND RIDE. HAS GOOD STYLING FOR ITS SIZE. VERY COMPETIVE IN ITS SIZE"
"05 30, 2011",Fall In Love again,"Love LOve LOVe LOVE this little suv! I am the mom of three grown boys(two still in college),when I get in my Rav4 and head down the road I feel 16 again. This car does anything I ask it to do. The only thing I can really complain about and it's very minor, when I close the door it sounds a little tinnie. It is a 4 cylinder front wheel drive and it has plenty of get up and go. I am very happy with my purchase just ask my kids. My three favorite things about my car are keyless entry, keyless start and the sunroof. I would highly recommend you give the Rav4 a try you just might fall in love again."
"05 27, 2011",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,"Last car owned 2001 RAV4

Negatives: Stripping along side of car to prevent
other car doors damaging, is much,
much smaller and not well placed.

Gear shifting is complicated by manufac-
turer trying to give some semblence to a
standard transmission. Writer's first car
was a standard transmission.

Interior arrangement and seemingly un-
necessary placement of some operative
instrument are confusing. Once again,
the manufacturer is reaching out in des-
peration to make the newest model dif-
ferent. Too bad, the first few years the
models changed little if at all. It all be-
gan when they extended the body 14"",
playing havoc with the MPG and making
it difficult to park in a two car garage.

Toyota. You really going to print this?"
"05 20, 2011",Versatile and Fun,"Bought new 4x4 Limited with v6 in 2009. Have 43,000 miles on car. This is the best car I have ever owned and am still waiting for something to break!
Lightning fast, steady and quiet at 75mph, and great breaking. 26mpg at 75. 31mpg at 60mph.
I tow a small boat easily.
Seat are comfortable, back seat roomy, and storage a plenty. I like the spare outside to gain the interior room.
I also like the swing out rear door because I no longer hit my head on old mini van rear door.
JBL Sound system, blue tooth, sirius radio, and i pod plug in all work great."
"05 16, 2011",A very good car,"A fund car to drive and very peppy for a four cylinder
Model.a little less economy than advertise but still
Efficient."
"05 11, 2011",Greatest value for the money.,"I purchased the Sport model. It came with lots of extras including a six cylinder engine. The salesperson told me that the difference in gas mileage between the four cylinder and six cylinder engine is only one mile per gallon. I am impressed by the roominess inside. The height, width and depth of the driver's seat suits me perfectly. The steering wheel is adjustible as to the angle and space from the dash. The combination of ample room and adjustibility is perfect for driver comfort.

The six cylinder engine and four speed transmission results in responsive and smooth acceleration for interstate access. The cargo area is spacious and the flattening of the 2nd row seats is easy and can be controlled from the rear of the car.

I also appreciate the quiet cabin. Very little, if any, road or wind noise. The video screen that appears in the rear view mirror makes for safer backing than just the mirrors. All in all, I have no complaints and find it difficult to think of a single problem with this car."
"05  5, 2011",Perfect for me and grandkids,"I have the seven passenger Rav 4 and it is perfect for hauling my grandchildren around in, as three in car seats and one on the way to be in car seat, so had to have room, but yet wanted good gas mileage and this vehicle was exactly what I was looking for."
"04 30, 2011",Limited V-6 4WD,"Short front seats leads to backache & fatigue even on short trips on 5'9"" driver. Power tilt on driver side does not angle high enough at front of seat. V-6 jumpy on throttle from a stop. Limited rides stiffly over bumps and road reflectors. Versatile sliding, folding, reclining rear seat. Rear seat pull downs from the hatch area are useful. Navigation system is poor and couldn't get the JBL radio with the Nav. Oil change surprise on V-6 since the oil filter is paper and the filter itself costs $35-$50! After living with it, no longer satisfied."
"04 27, 2011","Comfortable, sporty, all around great","We were looking for a car that you could get in and out of easily (sits up higher) and this was the ticket! Also it is roomy without being extremely big.
Feels good from every aspect.
Very pleased."
"04 26, 2011",Great Car,"The V6 Rav4 is a great car - fast, fun to drive, easy to maneuver. The MP3 changer is great. I wish the steering mounted controls were standard on every trim - but it can be added afterwards without much trouble (people on RAV4 forums have done this). Mine has the 3rd row seats. They are small but usable for short trips around town. Only dislike on styling is the rear mounted spare tire - wish it were hidden like the CR-V."
"04 23, 2011",2011 RAV4 V6 4WD vs 2009 CRV EX AWD,"I traded in my 2009 Honda CR-V, EX, AWD on the 2011 Toyota RAV4, Limited, V6, 4WD. Both were bought new by me.
CRV Pros:
Better exterior looks.
Better seating comfort.
Lift hatchback rear door.
Feels like it has more interior room than RAV4.
CRV Cons:
Severely under powered for even routine driving.
RAV4 V6 Pros:
GREAT power!
Almost the same fuel milage as the 4 cyl CRV.
Twice the towing capacity.
Ability to lock in the 4WD manually (not available on CRV).
Climate control.
Full-size spare.
RAV4 V6 Cons:
The side opening rear door sucks!
The back seat is not sized for adults. The back rest height barely comes up to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Definitely not sized for anything more than small children.
Very dated orange-yellow back lighting as opposed to the modern looking blue in the CRV.

For me, the three selling points for the RAV4 are the fantastic V6 with it's great power and MPG. The ability to manually lock-in the 4WD. And, it can tow more than the CRV.
I WOULD NOT buy the CRV because of the ridiculously under powered nature of the engine. It is horrible! However, if the CRV was available with the V6 similar to the RAV4 I would unquestionably buy the CRV over the RAV4.
I hope this helps someone considering the two SUVs."
"04  5, 2011",Very reliable car,"Big change from my old 2003 Rav4. Ride has improved and road noise is greatly reduced.
V6 engine runs smooth and much more power than the 4 cyl. engine."
"03 31, 2011",Best 4wd vehicle I have ever owned!,"Drives like a car while performing like an SUV. Simple, sturdy and reliable with a superb blend of attributes."
"03 27, 2011",merced toyota is the best,The RAV4 is a very different type of vehicle than the sedans and coupes previously owned. The RAV4 has great forward visibility. It feels bigger than it looks. The base model features are good.
"03 25, 2011",2011 RAV 4 review,"My second RAV4, a number of enhancements have been made on my LTD model since the 2007 model year I previously owned. The V6 is a great engine but my previous RAV had an annoying whine at 60 to 65 mph. Improvements in the electronically controlled transmission software have made the 2011 whisper quiet at these speeds. The smart key entry system works flawlessly and is great when you've got armfuls of stuff and can't fish the key out of your pocket. It even works when I'm wearing gloves. Zero squeaks or rattles, even in cold weather. V6 combined mileage has been in the 24 to 26 range, really good for a V6 4WD. Poor weather handling has been excellent, very stable on bad roads. No regrets in buying another one."
"03 22, 2011",Great Car,I had a Rav4 as a rental & decided to buy one. Best car I've ever owned & a good sized SUV for the city.
"03 22, 2011",Great in Snow & Ice,RAV4 handles well in the poorest of road conditions. Gives the driver the confidence in the cars ability to get you to your destination. Wind noise with rear windows cracked or open is quite annoying. Standard drivers seat can get uncomfortable. Rear window seems to get dirty quite easily. GREAT forward visability!
"03 14, 2011",Great car,"We recently sold our 2002 4Runner and bought a 2011 RAV4 sport. We look the outside and the intrerior is very well designed. The seats are comfortable and the interior has ample room for everything we need to fit, including the 2 car seats we'll be putting in later this year when our twins arrive. Ample power as the 179 hp is only slightly less than the '02 4Runner V6. It sips gas for an SUV."
"03 12, 2011",RAV4 Then and Now 2002-2011,Owned a 2002 RAV4 before buying this 2011 version. The new model is around 20% bigger and this change has more of an impact than I thought it would. On the plus side there is a lot more cargo room with or without the back seats folded down (I did not get the third row seat version) and more head room for taller passengers. On the minus side this is now a mid to large SUV so no more squeezing into the only tight parking spot left. I miss the ability I had with my 2002 version of taking out the rear seats for more cargo room and better gas mileage. However with the 2011 you get an extra glove box shelf and a variety of driver seat adjustments. Over all I like the new car and like anything new it takes some getting used to.
"03  8, 2011",the best,I am completely satisfied with the Rav SPORT model for 2011 Styling and comfort as well as satellite radio -best Toyota I have ever owned.
"03  5, 2011",2011 Toyota RAV4,"I love the car so far. It's quiet yet responsive. I have driven it in the snow and heavy rain. The Interiers are easy to use and all needed. Handling is great.

However, shouldn't the XM radio subscription come free with the deal, rather than just 3 months?"
"03  5, 2011",Great vehicle,I have the v6 model and it has great power along with shure footed in snow. Lots of room inside and a comfortable ride.
"03  1, 2011",the car that exceeded my expectations,"I wanted a compact SUV that gets good gas mileage,has a third row seat for my kids and comes in red!Did my research and came up with the RAV4 that I've been eyeing for a couple years already for its looks. We found one in a neighboring state and picked it up without even test driving it.No regrets as the Limited V6 has awesome acceleration!Talk about zoom,zoom!I live in Reno and its been great in the snow.My fellow musicians are in awe of the JBL speakers too."
"02 22, 2011",Glad I bought it!,"I bought this vehicle just as the snows descended on New England. I couldn't get this car to slip or slide! The V6 has ample horsepower, tranny shifts smoothly, butter-soft acceleration. I hope to keep it a very long time..."
"01 29, 2011",Bumpy ride,This SUV does not have the smoothest ride. You feel every bump on the road. It makes me wish I bought a regular car for a better ride. I wouldn't buy another one. I should have checked out the Honda's.
"12 30, 2010",I LOVE my new Rav4,"After 14 years as a Camry owner, I am a real Toyota believer. Even with the bad publicity Toyota endured earlier in 2010, I was not swayed from their product lines. However, I did want to sit up higher and have more visibility, so I decided to check out the Rav4 Limited, and I can't be happier with my decision. For once, I did not stint on the options, and already I am loving the heated leather seats (the cold winter in NYC so far has allowed me to really appreciate them) and the stereo system is fantastic. But the ride is the best - smooth, powerful, and pretty economical on the gas (though a bit less than the Camry, its true). I love the styling both outside and in, and feel I am a king in my new car."
"12  6, 2010",Rav4 for Mom,Mom loves it. Not the car for me but for her it is perfect. She lives in Colorado and it works great in the snow.
"11  9, 2023",Insufficient time line for Blizzard Pearl recall.,"The exterior received 1 star as the Blizzard Pearl paint looked great before its now ongoing pealing frenzy. 
The 2012 RAV4 is great in every aspect for its generation though the Blizzard Pearl isn’t holding up. 
The Blizzard Pearl paint, as good looking as it is, or paint prep is failing in a big way. The roof was pealing above the windshield aprox. 4 years ago, its repainting was cover per the extended warranty. Now 1 year after the warranty expired the hood, drivers side front post, drivers side passenger door and the rear hatch are all pealing. Blizzard Pearl! It’s now a looker going down the road for a different reason."
"07  6, 2023",To many problems in this Suv,This SUV HAS A SO MUCH PROBLEM I HAVE 2012 RAV4 51000 MILES IN MY SUV BURN OIL WHEEL SENIOR NO GOOD AIR BEG PROBLEM SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND FEW MORE PROBLEM WITH 2012 TOYOTA RAV4
"04 14, 2023",2012 Rav 4 is a gem.,I had a 2012 Rav 4 and a man ran a red light and ran over me and the Rav had to be junked. I got my second 2012 Rav 4 and both were and are wonderful cars. Would highly reccommend.
"01 27, 2023","RAV4 Sport v6, no better price for a 4WD","I had researched small/compact SUV vehicles in their respective class. Toyota known for reliability and quality for the price was on top of my list.
It took me a years time to have gotten lucky enough on a trade in at a local dealer. My timing was right on as when I arrived l looked it over before speaking with a rep. I overheard employees saying that the RAV4 Sport v6 check all the boxes and was a unicorn in and out. The owner must have taken a hit which after test driving it, it was straight as an arrow with minor slight blemishes for a 8 year old vehicle. I knew to make an offer, which was listed at $15,500. It was the end of the month, so it was approved to sell at $1000. Off if I took it that day. “Deal” and ever since driving it away with my temporary papers, I knew I found the SUV 4WD I’ve been looking for.
Right place, right time. I still have it and it’s a workhorse, and have put about 15k on it to which It had 60k when I purchased it.
Great buy, and say goodbye to v6 engines as the car companies need to go green and the future is about EV."
"04  5, 2021",Love love love it!,Everything mechanically was checked out and fixed by the dealer before driving off the lot. I love the low miles and great deal I got.
"03 31, 2021",This car is like my old one with way less miles.,It’s like brand new. It’s 4 years newer than my old car that has 260k miles. This has 65k miles. That’s why I bought another one. Love the v6 Rav 4. Hope they make it again.
"02  2, 2021",Best reliable suv I've ever owned,"This SUV didn't only meet my expectations,  it's far surpassed them.  Good on gas,  nice smooth ride,  and has not given me one problem.  2010-2012 is the best year,  that's my opinion."
"01 23, 2021",My favorite vehicle I’ve owned,It is perfect for what I need in a vehicle. Plenty of space to haul whatever I need. I like the styling and the overall design.
"01  3, 2021",Extremely reliable and spacious,"This car was very reliable and spacious. Not much for luxury, but it was a fantastic value, had plenty of space, and was good on gas."
"08 11, 2020",I Love My RAV4!,"I bought my RAV4 in 2015. It was 3 years old with 23,000 miles on it. Five years later I have 117,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier. I take care of normal maintenance and haven't had any unexpected repairs at all. Reliability is of utmost importance to me and its been flawless. I love the interior space and how it sits up high. Its fun to drive and great looking, too. This 2012 RAV4 has been exceptionally good for me."
"08  6, 2020",Very clean car for the money spent!,So far the car is running just fine it had low miles and is in very good shape. It’s hard to find a car this year that doesn’t have a lot of miles!!
"06 22, 2020",Amazing Safety Even Without Fancy Features,"I owned the 2012 RAV-4 from 2015-2020, bought it used. Never had any major maintenance issues even at 70k miles. The only reason I no longer own it is because of an accident; I hydroplaned on the highway, skidded across four lanes of traffic, and slammed into a guardrail—the car was sadly totalled, but there wasn't a single scratch on me. The safety and reliability of this car is unmatched for its class."
"01 27, 2020",This the best value for money car in any segment,"I got the 7 seater 4 cyl with dealer modified Sunroof etc. I fitted a android navigation unit to replace the original CD unit. 
This car never failed in snow, desert, highways or city. I drove it for 65K miles in NJ, CA & GA and it always did the job with very little maintenance like Battery, tires and Brakes. Get tires from tire shop and not from dealer as they sell very bad tires.
It is under powered compared to a V6 only on gradient roads. It can still be quick on the highways."
"01 27, 2020",one of the best cars i ever owned.,"i drove this car for the past five years and no problem ever. It is an 
excellent drive and very low maintenance and fantastic gas millage."
"12 31, 2019",Best affordable car ever!,"Not luxurious, but ROOMY, COMFORTABLE, & RELIABLE. No issues ever!  Perfect seat-height for us seniors. Easy getting in/out. Great, tight turning-radius.  Would definitely buy again."
"12 31, 2019",Love Toyota RAV4 this is my second,I’ve been spoiled for other cars by the RAV4. My last one had over 195k miles. I’m looking for even better longevity with this one.
"12  8, 2019",Very nice comfortable car!,This car has plenty space and not too big. The seats are comfortable. The car is smooth to drive. I liked that car very much.
"11 30, 2019",I heard fantastic things about this vehicle,"Everything I was looking for.  I was looking for something that sat higher, a vehicle with storage space and would do great in all weather conditions."
"11 12, 2019",Tank of a car,"Two weeks and one day after I bought this car I was rear-ended by a Ford focus hatchback.

The girl texting and driving had to have her vehicle towed from the scene, and the spare tire on mine took most of the damage. She still did about $3,000 worth of damage, but I was able to drive away.

The car can use a better sound system, and the seats are okay - but it's a tank in the snow, and so far has been great."
"09  2, 2019",Disappointed ☹️,"The brakes make a clicking noise. The paint is coming off in sheets on the passenger side, and the windshield wipers are almost inoperable. I’ve taken the car in twice and nothing happened. The dealership does not  respond to my questions nor does the manufacturer."
"08 27, 2019",So far it's very nice,"We've only owned it for a little over a week but so far it's been a good vehicle. From experience I know that Toyota makes some very good cars and trucks, that's why we went with this."
"07 18, 2019",Great vehicle for light 4x4,"I've owned this car for almost 4 years now. It has been rock solid from day one, and has never shown any problems. It is just big enough to fit 2 adults and 3 kids (2 in boosters, 1 in car-seat). It has been great for long trips, and gets decent gas mileage.

My biggest complaint about the car was that the cargo door opens up the wrong way. When I park on the right side of the street, the door opens out to the right. So now I can't just unload right onto the curb, I have to carry thing around the door."
"07  7, 2019",Best in Total cost of ownership,"Dealers were nice during maintenance. Yes they were pushy, but I was careful. Don't use stick tires or battery. Costco has better options. Driver seat is not comfortable for a 6 foot folks. I have a seven seater that was used when there are guests."
"06 25, 2019",My last 5 cars have been Toyotas.,Great on back roads.  Toyotas run forever. The only problem is that the last owner was a heavy smoker.  My dealer was great —- I would buy from him again.
"06  5, 2019",Love Love this !!!,"Love the look of the Rav4,  and how much room there is in the back. Can't wait to be riding the roads and showing it off!"
"05  1, 2019","Bought in Blue Springs MO and drove it to LA, CA","This RAV 4 performed really well on a long trip to LA the day after I bought it used. It handled the cold, the desert and the mountains effortlessly.  I would highly recommend buying a used vehicle from Universal Auto Plaza Blue Springs, MO."
"03 22, 2019",Works for my fam!,It’s a great car for nuclear family. I’d recommend it for folks who’d want to go on road trips and have stuff to carry on.
"01 20, 2019",It is the most reliable car.,Yes this car did meet my needs as has always been and I will recommend a friend ant time to buy or service their car .
"10 26, 2018",I love the style size the great pickup from the v,This suv is great meets all my needs that?s why I selected this vehicle plus low maintenance dependable performance reliable handles very well great pickup too
"08 15, 2018",Love this car!,After I broke my hip I had to trade my Fit for a higher sitting car. Thought about a crv but decided on the Rav instead & never regretted my decision.
"07 27, 2018",RAV4 are the best cars we've ever owned!,"Great size, V6 has crazy amazing power, 3 rows of seats in an SUV this size is outstanding. Reliability is top notch and service is a breeze.  Best family car ever with great features for the value.  Our favorite care to date and we've had 3!!!"
"07 26, 2018",I feel safe driving it in really any conditions.,"This car has been great for me!  I needed something that would drive well in the snow, and it has done that and more.  It technically can fit 7 (which is really nice at times) but the back 2 seats have very little legroom, so stick your short friends back there."
"07  3, 2018",Been a great vehicle.,Has met all of my needs. Upkept very well. Never been in the shop except for routine maintenance issues. Only selling because I want to buy a newer model.
"06 21, 2018","great, comfortable car.","I bought this car new and have all of the service records and manuals.  It is a great ride, good visibility, comfortable and reliable. It is a high end model with leather interior and weather tech floor mats. Blue tooth phone connection."
"06 19, 2018",Third RAV4 and looking forward to the next...,I absolutely love my RAV4 - as mentioned this is my third one.  All three of my RAVs were V6 engine - won't buy the 4 cylinder.  The RAV has the largest cargo space of any vehicle in it's class.  Loads of room!  I can't wait for the 2019 - new EVERYTHING - remodeled with technology in mind.  Seriously - you cannot go wrong with a used RAV.  Love my car!
"06 15, 2018",good car for hauling,this has been a very good car for big loads. The only problem is there is not enough leg room for the mean in our family
"06 13, 2018",Excellent car all around!,This is a great car. Never given me any problems. I can haul a ton of stuff. Very comfortable and roomy. I would buy this car again.
"06  6, 2018",Fantastic auto,"We bought our 2012 rav4 sport v6 and new off the lot in 2012.  Been a super vehicle.  Don't listen to others get the v6.  It is far better then the 4 and actually gets better gas mileage.  It has 70,000 miles on it now with absolutely no problems.  I would definitely buy it again."
"06  5, 2018",My Favorite Car!,"I've owned a lot of cars, got to be at least 15, in my life. This one is by far my favorite! It's pretty, fast, reliable and all around everything I love in a car."
"05 29, 2018",love it,"Runs nice, comfortable, lots of room and storage space. I bought it used and it is the best uses car I have purchased to date. Great car, would def recommend to another person"
"05 21, 2018",Great small SUV for the money.,"The RAV4 is s dependable small SUV with excellent intetior space. It is a very good SUV for family trips that require space for luggage, coolers and sports gear."
"05  6, 2018",They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!,Great ride and much sportier to drive than the larger Highlander and 4 Runner.  The interior layout is perfect!  The cargo area is probably the largest in the compact SUV class (at this time).  Too bad you can no longer get a V6 option (2012 was the last year):  That makes this great car truly outstanding!
"05  4, 2018",LOVE THIS CAR,"VERY NICE CONDITION, LIKE THE AMENITIES, DRIVES GREAT AND I HOPE IT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY IT OFF -- LOOKING FORWAARD TO DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT"
"05  3, 2018",Excellent transportation in the winter,Perfect family vehicle. Roomy. Gas mileage was as good as I?ve gotten. Long road trips were made w/ it on a monthly basis. Never had a single issue.
"05  2, 2018",Most reliable vehicle ever,"My 2012 Toyota RAV4 has been a great friend to me. It has helped tremendously in every winter storm for the last three years. Cheap on gas, extremely reliable, this is definitely an excellent vehicle!!"
"04 13, 2018",Fun drive,A very fun drive and a lot of space. We used it for moving stuff all the time. Great drive for snow days. Great value and gas mileage.
"04 11, 2018",Excellent Vehicle,"Powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride. Very reliable. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I do not expect to ever sell it."
"03  3, 2018",I so in love with this car very reliable,Omg fits my needs love the space something different it's fits me.and all love the storage space as well best vehicle every the kids love it great price.
"02 24, 2018",Great Reliability and Practicality,"Very reliable
Cheap to maintain
Holds value very good as for a used car
I recommend to buy 4cylinder with all wheel drive, most popular model and will always have demend"
"02 20, 2018","Why do my lights keep comeing on,4x4, traction con","The rav4 comes up with a code o2 sensor, bank 1 sensor 2. You change it then comes rite back on along with 4?4  light and traction control  light. So you change it again. 17 miles latter they are back on .  Why. Alot of people are having same problem"
"02  7, 2018",One of the best Vehicle that I owned,I owned and driven 100s of cars in my lifetime. I worked at many car rental companies for 20 years. This vehicle will always my top recommendation to everyone
"02  3, 2018",Great looking and fun to drive car!,"I am a big Toyota fan with this 2012 RAV4 being the 7th Toyota I have owned.  They have all been very reliable, fun to drive, and go forever.   This is the first time I have owned a RAV4 though but so far so good as it seems to represent the Toyota brand like all others.  It is comfortable with the basic options, powerful enough with the 4-cylinder engine, and feels very safe driving.   Great car!"
"01 29, 2018",very stable free way driving,itsan amazing Small SUV.  lots of room for cargo. fun to drive. very good on gasoline. small enough to fit a any space like regular car.
"01 23, 2018",great Car!,"I got this car in 2015. I got it used with 18k miles on it.  I use it as my daily driver  and it's perfect  for San franciscos pothole filled streets. Though it's only a 2wheel drive, I have taken her camping to Yosemite, death valley, Zion, grand staircase escalante, Bruce canyon, Vegas, l.a., tahoe. it's great for camping for 2 people as you can fit lots of stuff in the back with the seats down. you can travel with 2 people in the back on long drives but the back seats need much better cushioning. 3 in the back is fine but might be uncomfortable for long drives. your passengers must really like each other. back seats recline. I also used my rav for moving and hauling Ikea items. the 176hp is sufficient enough for me. it has good pick up. the one I have is the standard 2wd. I think I would opt for 4wd next time just because I like to travel to more places."
"01 18, 2018","Rav 4, the car to have in the winter","An excellent vehicle for us.  It is a V6 so it has plenty of hustle in traffic and the  mpg's we get is very satisfactory at 25 on trips and 23 -24 around town.  An excellent vehicle for winter driving as well.   I would recommend a Rav, but only if the V6 was brought back.  Too bad it is no longer available in newer models."
"01 12, 2018",Best car I've ever owned!,"I love this vehicle! Well-made, safe, solid, fuel-efficient, comfortable, with lots of smart and convenient design features. Bought used from Toyota on the Park -- what a great deal and great dealership!"
"01  8, 2018",Toyota Rav4 Limited Excellent style and performanc,This SUV is comfortable with excellent head and leg room. Comfortable for Highway Travel long distances. Heated seats for winter. Driver and passenger visibility is outstanding. Dual comfort climate control makes it nice in summer and winter. Dependable with good gas mileage for full passengers and cargo ride.
"11 17, 2017",One of the greatest crossovers to ever exist!,"I own the basic 4WD V6 RAV4 2012 Model, yes the last V6 Model every made by Toyota. This car made it through a 36 hour drive to Georgia and back with no problems! The vehicle performance is similar to a Camry Sport feel, and the acceleration is powerful! It feels like I'm sitting in a  race car when I hop behind the wheel of my RAV4. If you are able to find one, get one. The 2013 and up models do not compare to this beast."
"11  7, 2017","Five years, 80.000 miles",One minor repair in all this time.  29.5mpg overall. Love the driving position and the handling of the vehicle.
"11  5, 2017",Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned,I love the reliability of my RAV4 and how it performs. I have owned or leased many cars.. Best brand
"11  3, 2017",Best Car Ever,"I love this car so much. It is comfortable and reliable, with tons of trunk space and good visibility."
"10 27, 2017",Fantastic SUV,"I love my Rav4. There's a lot more room than you would think. It comfortably fits 5, with lots of trunk space. I can't wait to test the 4WD this winter!"
"10 14, 2017","Overall OK, but need input.","I have a 2012 Rav4, (5 years old) Overall the car has been a good investment.  I have had a problem with the service lights on the dash, (Service Engine, 4-WD, and Track Off) remaining on. I had the O2 sensor replaced as the code read indicated was the problem. A few miles down the road  after the repair, the lights came on again, and the O2 sensor was again listed as the problem.  There are many people on-line with the same problem, (some have paid thousands of dollars trying to find the cause).  Toyota told me it was my car and that I should continue spending money to find out the problem.  Anyone else with this vehicle that might have suggestions?  I'm pretty frustrated with Toyota right now and wanted to share this concern to other owners who might have the same issues.  Other than that, the car works fine."
"10  9, 2017",Another Excellent Toyota Car,"I've owned my RAV4 since 2012 and I love it. I never had any problems with it since. I trust the brand name Toyota for its excellent commitment to their customers. I am not a car enthusiast but i know that if you want a vehicle for keeps, get a Toyota."
"10  6, 2017",great replacement for crv...,"hoping for best here....bought to replace older Honda crv--this has last year of v6 engine with heavy tow  package, so i can tow more than the Honda 1600 # limit.....although  rides stiffer due to run-flat tires and sport suspension tuning.....but everything else is what i wanted."
"10  2, 2017",Great SUV,"Love the 2012 RAV4 Limited with 4WD, 25 mpg, heated seats, remote start, backup camera, Bluetooth, and more. Mine has had bullet proof reliability and low maintenance costs. I wish the driver's seat was more comfortable and the interior design was upgraded. It has a huge amount of cargo room and I like the side opening tail gate."
"09 19, 2017",Great Reliable Car for the money,"Good car, rides well, good in snow -  a good safe car.  It was rated well for safety.  It is not a fast car, however drives well."
"09 15, 2017",Very happy Rav4 owner,"I havent had my Rav4 long, but i absolutely love it.  It seems very versatile and adequate for darn near anything.  I've been surprised by the power it has despite being a four cyclinder yet stays very efficient as well.  I like the interior design but do wish for a little more leg room for the backseat.  I prefer the boxier maybe jeepier look of the 2012 and older but i have heard friends with this era model complain about the rear door being too heavy with the spare tire, and that they have trouble closing while parked on a hill and that the hinges are insufficient.  I bought mine used and while the door seems fine it does rattle a bit upon closing.  I needed a family vehicle and efficient commuter car with awd and this hits all the boxes and then some.  All with Toyota's legendary reliability.  Im a person who wants to be in love with his vehicle and keep it til it dies and i imagine im gonna have this Rav4 for a long time!"
"09  5, 2017",Reliability is what I look for in a car,This car is nice looking car that is reliability. I found this car drives well on winter snow and ice. There is space to hold 5 adults and luggage for travel. I recommend this car. In fact I own two Rav4 cars.
"09  1, 2017",Overall great vehicle!,"We needed a vehicle larger than a car, but smaller than an SUV and this is the perfect size. Reliable, comfortable & plenty of truck space for traveling."
"08 19, 2017",Realiable as always in a Toyota,"Great riding vehicle and it handles excellent... also good vehicle for the price ...it's a sporty, SUV and it's the best as far as reliability.."
"08 18, 2017",This car met all my needs.,Very close to my former Lexus RX330 I used to own. Very spacious and great driving for bad weather condition.
"08  9, 2017",Great vehicle - very reliable,"I have really enjoyed owning my 2012 RAV4 Sport V6 - easy to drive, easy to park, handles like a sports car, great in the mountains and the snow. It is big enough for a small family of 4, has enough cargo room for normal jobs, and with the V6 and trailer hitch can tow my small utility trailer or 1500lb boat with ease. I'm just sad they don't make this vehicle / engine combo any longer - don't know what I will replace it with when it is time."
"07 22, 2017",Rad RAV4,"I LOVE being a RAV4 driver. This car is my pride and joy. Reliable and very attractive. 
I have the limited model, so the vehicle has leather/heated seats, a moon/sunroof, backup camera, and all the bells and whistles. It is absolutely my dream car. Toyota's are great cars and this is no exception. However, I do not care much for the body style of the RAV4's after 2012, so anything 2013+ does not interest me much. 

A used RAV will serve you well! The gas mileage is good for an SUV/crossover. Spacious on the inside with LOTS of trunk room. 

Love this car!"
"07  1, 2017",Beautiful car,"Driving this car, I knew right away that tho car was for me. Perfect size for my family of 5.  Beautiful inside and out, lots of technology."
"07  1, 2017",Great car,"Wonderful car, has a ton of room for my family of 5. Comfortable, and was built well and very reliable."
"06 26, 2017",Love the V6 engine!!,"I love having the extra power of the V6 because I drive in the mountains often. I wish I had a sunroof and feel like the space in the front seats could be designed better. Like having more compartments for phone, purse, etc would be nice. I love how the seats lay down flat in the back and I can sleep back there when I'm camping. Also love the extra storage compartment in the back where the spare tire would normally be."
"06 18, 2017",not my favorite car that i have owned,it meets my needs i dont have any problems with it but it is not very comfortable and it is not the best looking car in the world
"06 12, 2017",One of the safest cars by consumer reports!,"Awesome! I feel that it is one of the safest vehicles for my family to ride in. I love it, and it is very reliable, sporty, fun vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Easy to drive,The Rav4 is easy to drive and handles well. The turning radius is the smallest I have ever experienced.  The wheel lock button should be useful for getting out of snow or ice or mud. The interior has lots of space when the seats fold down. Highly recommended.
"05 23, 2017",IT IS OKAY IF YOU ARE BYE YOURSELF,"OKAY. at the time i needed something to go back and forth to GA it serve it purposed for what I need it for. If you are a big person it is not a good truck to have to small for anyone over 5 ft.
other wise it is a good truck. good on gas."
"05 23, 2017","Toyota Rav4, sensible and reliable","Bought my 2012 Rav4 new in 2012. 46k miles later, no repairs other than brakes and tires. Reliable , comfortable, love my heated seats.  Wish the engine and road noise weren't so loud."
"05 12, 2017",Very Reliable,Its good its got good mileage it got a good doors. its got good wheels. all four wheels work really well. everythings pretty good the seats are very comfortable
"04 24, 2017",Great Toyota product,I love my Rav4 and plan to be buying a new one in the next year or so very likely!  Toyota has been the most reliable trouble free vehicles I have ever owned and would not think of switching brands!
"04 10, 2017",Reliable & Versatile,It's been very reliable and versatile. Great for getting to work and for transporting larger items. It's easy to drive and has good gas mileage.
"03 21, 2017",Best car yet.,"Purchased my Rav4 through Prestige Toyota of Kingston. Joseph Rodelli has the patience of a saint! Took me a while to make up my mind, but I'm definitely pleased with my purchase."
"03 10, 2017",2012 Toyota RAV4,"The Toyota RAV4 is a great car. It's reliable, safe, spacious, sleek, and has all the basic features you would want your car to have. I've never had an issue with my car, I trust it completely. The seats aren't as comfortable as some other cars, but that's not too big of a deal to me. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a safe, gas efficient car."
"03  9, 2017",We love our used RAV4!,"It's beautiful, comfortable, well-designed, efficient, a dream to drive, and it was such a great deal from Toyota On The Park in Toronto. Great dealership and repair place. We are 100% happy. Love it!"
"05 28, 2016",Nice small car,You don't need the v 6.  3 row seat is a waist of money.Not comfortable to drive if over six foot.Weak a.c.. Nice car and runs good but get a loaded limited..
"06 10, 2015",Rav4,"Love my new Rav4. I've only had it a week, but I can tell you, I feel safe in it and secure with my decision in purchasing one. Toyota's are dependable, safe and they hold their value for years to come. I would recommend one to anybody. Great car!"
"03 11, 2014",The most valuable small SUV,"I purchased 2012 Sport V4 model to replace 2005 Sienna Van. I rented a Hyundi Santa Fe for roadtrip before my purchsing. I also tested Nissan Rouge and Honda CRV. Rav4 and Honda CRV were on the final run. I choice Toyota because the package met my need for the price that I expected.

Less than one year later, my wife purchased the 2013 CRV base model.

Now, I can tell you the true experience of these two competitors as the user.

They both have same performance.

Rav4 2012 is the last year of the old model. Its interior was designed for V6 w/7 seat optiopn. The 2nd row seat can be slided back and forth. My 5 seat get extra leg room when I push back. Because mine is 5 seat model. It has X-extra huge cargo space. Put down the 2nd row seat, I can still get a flat space like a bed when I going out for camping like driving Sienna van. The 6 speakers audio has excellent sound quality. The only Con's for this car from my experience are 2:
1. The doors are very light, so most of times I have push a little when closing the door.
2. The gas tank is only 12 gal. I believe this is a compromise for the other X-extra features for 7 seat option. I believe this has been changed to 16 gal. in 2013 new model. Of cause, you will not get those X-extra space from 2013 model.
My Sport model come with roof window, rack, buletooth and MP3, USB and back-up camera.
I used to buy long lumbers from HomeDepot when I drove Sienna van. Although Rav4 is not as long as Sienna van , I can still buy plenty of 2x6x(8+ size). My Rav4 Sport model has #3 gear which help picking up speed on highway when I need.

Honda has better interior (roomy). The windshield was pushed forward with wider glass to get more space. The interior width is also a little wider than Rav4. The driver's seat has arm rest which is good for long trip. The back-up camera(rear monitor) has become standard feature which is very thoughtful for high position vehicle. The cargo space is huge too. CRV has smaller turning radious for you make U-turn.

They both make you feel very steady while driving on the curving road. They both very reliable, comfort, good driver's view to all around the traffic. The price is difficult to compare each other. I will think they are pretty much the same if same features, but unfortuantely their different trims equipted with different features.

Toyota Rav4 (even though 2013 model) is a little sporty looking while CRV is more like city car. You shall pick what you need. You will like either one. Both Toyota and Honda make good value products.

So far, I have 10500 miles on my Rav4 and over 5000 miles on CRV.

My Rav4 perform 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the roadtrip with premium gas.

My wife has never counted the mpg for her CRV. I think it is about the same in city. I guess the roadtrip mpg shall be a little better if we try Eco-mode. She mentioned one time about Eco-mode and said ""You don't want use this feature in the town even though on highway because the system will run with less power."" I guess that Eco-mode will be very helpful if we go for roadtrip in Wild West.

Hope these true experience are helpful for you."
"01 24, 2014",Great buy,"We really like this car! Got it because we're expecting a baby and wNt something reliable and functional. We got it from Maguire Toyota in Ithaca, NY, and Bridget helped us. She was fantastic- never pressured us, just showed us everything we wanted to see, gave us more information, and answered all our questions. We'll be going back there for our next vehicle purchase,"
"11 25, 2013","Like the car, but. . .","RAV is a good choice, generally. Can't beat it for dependability, resale, etc. Not very exciting in the interior, although it's OK. I like the external spare, but that's going away, along with leather seat covers and V6 power. Uses tons of fuel, but that's true with the smaller engine as well."
"09  8, 2013","Very good on gas milage, reliable and beautiful.","Very good on gas milage.
Nice,cozy interior and beautifully crafted exterior.
Spacious trunk for shopping and for reasonable haulage.
Easily accessible driving features and equiped with some modern car technology. Loving It."
"07 28, 2013",Loving it!,"Looks great, drives great. I bought it for the AWD feature for winter driving. I'm happy it will have the power when I need it, and has great gas mileage."
"07 22, 2013",My Dream UV I Never Knew!,"I am amazed at the comfort and security this vehicle gives me once I get behind the wheel. The difference in the gas mileage expenditure has improved from day one. I love the GPS feature and Blue tooth, which have come in so handy for me with my kids/family/co-workers! I love my Rav4! THANKS JESSE!!"
"03  7, 2013",great car!,The seller and finance personnel were all very helpful and proffessional. But best of all i got the best deal in the market! I love my new toyota rav4!!!
"02 28, 2013",AWESOME!,"We just love this vehicle! Within 15 minutes of purchasing I was traveling 300 miles. It rode smoothly, I feel safe in it, comfy...simple WE LOVE IT!"
"02 23, 2013",like the v6 power. Goooooo,"I have a 2007 Rav4 and use it for travel. The V6 give you the option of getting out of the way or hitting the brakes. the interstates are test of survival. So when I found out that toyota was getting rid of the V6 safety feature, I purchased the 2012 with the V6. Now the 2013 Rav4 looks like all the rest. Oh hum"
"01 29, 2013",Mitsubishi,"Happy with car after purchase. There is nothing more to say than, what a nice car. It was the cae that caught my eye on the road"
"01 24, 2013",Found a great car at a great price,"Haven't had it long enough to really tell yet, but so far, I am more than satisfied. The ride is a little stiff. The gas mileage has been better than expected."
"01 22, 2013",Great Solid Driver,"Drove them all found the Rav 4 to be the most solid feeling Cross over in it's class. Nice feel on the hi-way, great brakes, comfortable firm but not harsh ride."
"01 17, 2013",Bought Toyotas since 1976,"We've bought Toyotas since we were married in 1976. We have found them to be very realiable. We're had corolla, camrays, Supra, Thundra, other trucks, and this is my second Rav 4"
"01 15, 2013",Outstanding buying expierence!,"As a long term West Herr customer, I recently referred a friend to ""Casey Mac Alpine"" at West Herr Toyota of Williamsville. Just wanted to express the great customer service that my friend received from ""Casey""which was ""Class A all the way. She mentioned that this was the best car buying experience that she has ever had in the many years of dealing with sales people. She felt that the he listened and cared!"
"01 14, 2013",Fun little in-town car,"Fun to drive, Not a luxury car, nice little commuter that holds a lot. Great on gas. I use the Rav4 to get to and from work about 5 miles each way. I also have horses and need to hall feed from time to time and this little SUV does it all. Recently put 10 bags of shavings in it with no trouble at all. I needed a car with good gas mileage and could hall feed, and large dogs. This Rav4 seems to do it all with ease. So far I love it. Don't think i would like it on a long trip."
"01  9, 2013",best suv,looks great feels good great ride. Has many extra's and toyota is big on all the small details and extras
"01  6, 2013",Worst experience,"First off, my family has always owned a Toyota and NEVER ever had problems. We were always satisfied by how reliable the quality of Toyota vehicles were.

With an almost 1 yr old and me being pregnant, my husband and I decided we needed to buy a brand new car. He wanted a Ford or Jeep, but I insisted on Toyota. I did so much research and showed him all the great consumer and expert reviews on the Rav4. He finally caved in and we bought a brand new 2012 Rav4.

We got it in August 2012 and loved it! But then 3 months later (1,200 mileage only) in November (we live in the UK by the way, stationed in England), it broke down on me and my daughter at night in the cold. We were stuck for 1.5hr trying to get help and then finally a friend was able to get us but he tried to drive it too, and it broke down on him too. I know my prego hormones were out of wack, but it was awful and my daughter was crying hysterically by the way. We were cold and scared!

My husband tried to drive it to the Cambridge Toyota center but it broke down on him too and he had to wait 4hrs and 40 mins for someone to tow it to the dealership.

Then it took almost 2 weeks to figure out what was wrong with it. My husband who was deploying the following week at first was asking friends for rides to his deployment appointments and briefings, but since it was taking longer than expected we had to rent a car (which is not covered by warranty). It was just the worst timing ever.

The fuel pump pressure was defective. Warranty covered it and is ""fixed"" they say, but apparently it is still causing problems because our neighbors who are currently watching the car for us (they'll be watching it for about 6 months) says it still runs when they drive it, but it feels like it might stall at stops. It hasn't stalled yet, but STILL, what safety is that?!

Sorry Toyota, this experience totally made me never want to own one, and not only do I feel betrayed by Toyota's reliable past, I also feel like I disrespected my husband by not considering the Ford or Jeep he wanted. Should have just listened to him and trusted him!

Totally disappointed and not looking forward to going back to the UK to drive a potentially hazardous car for our family."
"12 20, 2012",G-Man,"This is the third Rav4 I've owned. They never disappoint. Excellent performance, comfort, and very
reliable. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space, comes in
handy, on many occasions. Living in New England, the
Rav4, enables you to drive in any condition, with confidence. I've had a direct influence on six friends,
who also purchased Rav4's."
"12 19, 2012",RECOMMEND TO ALL,"CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, RECOMMEND TO ALL.PERFECT SO EASY TO DRIVE, WARRENTY IS GREAT, MAINTANCE IS EXCELLENT."
"12 10, 2012",Excellent!,"Best car I've ever owned ... I traded a 2009 RAV4 for my 2012! Great mileage, comfort, style, perfect for toting my amps and guitars to gigs. Love it!"
"10 31, 2012",RAV,"This is the fourth Toyota in our household and my second RAV4. My first RAV4 was 12yrs old, and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was to get the down payment to buy a newer one. I got a great price when I sold my 2001 RAV4 - had I been able to keep the old one and still buy the new one, I would have b/c I LOVE my RAVs!"
"10 26, 2012",Excellent little car,Care has plenty of pep and get-up-and-go for a 4-cylinder engine. The handling is superb. Very pleased with leg room. Good dependable care for the money. Would recommend to a friend
"10 22, 2012",The RAV4 Sport,"Fabulous vehicle, way more room than the Honda CR-V! Strongly influenced by owning a 2003 Matrix for 8 years! Durable, long lasting, and reliable! Never doubted the vehicle for a second! I am very happy about my Dad's advice and gearing me towards a RAV4 Sport! Absolutely outstanding. My husband jokingly and lovingly says; ""All you ever do is have a nicer car than your husband!""

Love it!"
"10 17, 2012",Very comfortable,"I'm 6'4"" with arthritis in knees and hips. The RAV4 allows me to travel for more than 1 1/2 hrs before I need to stop to relieve knee and hip pain. There is also more than ample headroom."
"09 28, 2012",Need more seat time to be totally objective,"Great mid size SUV.
Good Fuel economy.
Great Ride with good cornering stability.
Toyo Open country tires noisy on some furfaces."
"09 23, 2012",Safe and Reliable Small SUV,"This is the second RAV4 we have owned. It is a nice little SUV for our needs, we purchased for reliability and the value we got for the money. Very easy to drive and has all the safety features you need in a modern vehicle including the backup camera. Plenty of room in the back for all our stuff and a Kayak on top of the racks. Plus my wife likes how the higher stance of the vehicle gives her a better view of the road. The RAV4 fits our lifestyle and needs."
"09 21, 2012",32 mpg on hwy,"minimum 28 mpg through yellowstone, tetons,rockies. almost drives itself.only a four cylinder but plenty power."
"09 10, 2012",Just another car,"It is an okay car, if my Honda was not totaled I would not have bought this. According to the on car mpg gauge we are only getting 21 mpg."
"08 24, 2012",Rav4 Review,"Stylish , Innovative, Contemporary Toyota Moving Forward! Vast Improvement over last years mOdel, no recalls yet?"
"08 24, 2012",My New Rav 4,"I've been a Toyota person forever. Prior to this SUV, I had a Yaris - which is fantastic on gas. I needed a vehicle for the snow, plus a larger one for my dogs. I absolutely love my SUV, roomy enough, and it sits high enough (like a truck) so I can see past the vehicle ahead of me. It rides so smootlhly and I can't wait to use all the gadgets I've never had before in a car. For a larger vehicle that I am used to - it is doing exceptionally well on gas. (I average 26.5 mpg) This is in the city - mind you. This is also the first vehicle I've had which is automatic. I have to remind myself not to shift & not to clutch. Other than this, I love my new Rav-ioli."
"08 23, 2012",Better than govt. motors,Got tired of poor quality of gm dealers. Tired of their shoddy service and excuses. Bought Toyota. Best personal service of dealers and sales. Most courteous and genuine. WONT GO BACK TO GM.
"08 23, 2012",Raving over the Rav 4,"It took me a long time to settle on and buy exactly what I wanted. The Toyota Rav 4 Sport V6. It's fun to drive, surprisingly quick and responsive, looks amazing (sport w/appearance package) and toyota's reliability is bar none. I wish that they offered navigation systems in the other models besides the limited, but I'll just have to use the maps on my smart phone. Great all round, 4 seasons car."
"08 21, 2012",love my suv,It is what I wanted and thank the dealer for making it possible. Love the way it drives and the way it looks.
"08 14, 2012",RAV4 SPORT RED,"I bought RAV4 Sport, ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy... if you driving by yourself, I guess it?s O.K.. it?s not good for family ride. First couple of years I use to get good gas mileage, then it?s drop to around 17-19 miles? I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. If I wait till 5K there won't be any oil to change, it burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 3 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's normal. What I am hearing and reading almost all the TOYOTA cars are BURNING OIL like crazy. Now I just add oil every other month, seems like I made a big mistake buying the RAV4,, after 4-recall I think I am done with TOYOTA!!"
"07 12, 2012",Must have,I love this car and the stylish new look. I have the sport and it's a beautiful SUV. Must have........
"06 29, 2012",now a two rav4 family,the 97 rav 4 is sweet with no problems other than normal service which is expected so we added a new one to the family which is the 2012 rav4 limited and passed on the 4 wheel drive and 6 cylinder as we live in Florida and wanted the best millage and did not have the need for a 6 or 4x4 as our new 2012 rav has more power than the 97 which is fine everywhere fully loaded with camp equipment except for going up mountains where I could not even meet the 55 mph speed limit so expect the new rav to hanndle that even better
"05  6, 2012",2nd Toyota SUV - after Chevys and Benzs...,"Since last few weeks I am enjoying my new 2012 Toyota RAV4 Sport 4WD, it is really a nice vehicle.
Bluetooth works great, Fuel wise is also very echonomical, drive smooth."
"04 19, 2012",2nd RAV 4 I've Owned,"This is the 2nd RAV 4 I've Owned. Traded in a 2002 Model RAV 4 for the 2012 Model. It's quite different and I still love it. It's larger, roomier and still great to handle. I especially like the roomier back seat and the larger cargo area. Looked at some competitor's vehicles but came back to the RAV 4 mostly for the reliability and great value."
"04 16, 2012",My Rav,"This is the best car i ever own, I always wanted it. If I didnt get it I woudnt feel right. When you really want something you have to go for it!!"
"04 12, 2012",Love it so far,"I just got my 2012 Rav4 a few weeks ago and took it on a 14 hours round trip to Virginia with no problems. I averaged 25mpg- not awesome but I'll take it. It was very car-like and easy to handle and also very comfortable. Visibility was fine. You do have to watch for wind - common with taller cars but I was driving a tiny sedan previously so it was not something I was used to right away. I love the bluetooth capability and the controls on the dash - something I did not really think I would care about. Since I went from CNY (40 degrees) to Va (65 degrees) I got to use both heat and a/c: both were fine. Lots of storage space throughout. My friend just traded in her 12 year old Rav 4 with over 140,000mi on it. I hope mine lasts that long!"
"11  9, 2023",Insufficient time line for Blizzard Pearl recall.,"The exterior received 1 star as the Blizzard Pearl paint looked great before its now ongoing pealing frenzy. 
The 2012 RAV4 is great in every aspect for its generation though the Blizzard Pearl isn’t holding up. 
The Blizzard Pearl paint, as good looking as it is, or paint prep is failing in a big way. The roof was pealing above the windshield aprox. 4 years ago, its repainting was cover per the extended warranty. Now 1 year after the warranty expired the hood, drivers side front post, drivers side passenger door and the rear hatch are all pealing. Blizzard Pearl! It’s now a looker going down the road for a different reason."
"07  6, 2023",To many problems in this Suv,This SUV HAS A SO MUCH PROBLEM I HAVE 2012 RAV4 51000 MILES IN MY SUV BURN OIL WHEEL SENIOR NO GOOD AIR BEG PROBLEM SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND FEW MORE PROBLEM WITH 2012 TOYOTA RAV4
"04 14, 2023",2012 Rav 4 is a gem.,I had a 2012 Rav 4 and a man ran a red light and ran over me and the Rav had to be junked. I got my second 2012 Rav 4 and both were and are wonderful cars. Would highly reccommend.
"01 27, 2023","RAV4 Sport v6, no better price for a 4WD","I had researched small/compact SUV vehicles in their respective class. Toyota known for reliability and quality for the price was on top of my list.
It took me a years time to have gotten lucky enough on a trade in at a local dealer. My timing was right on as when I arrived l looked it over before speaking with a rep. I overheard employees saying that the RAV4 Sport v6 check all the boxes and was a unicorn in and out. The owner must have taken a hit which after test driving it, it was straight as an arrow with minor slight blemishes for a 8 year old vehicle. I knew to make an offer, which was listed at $15,500. It was the end of the month, so it was approved to sell at $1000. Off if I took it that day. “Deal” and ever since driving it away with my temporary papers, I knew I found the SUV 4WD I’ve been looking for.
Right place, right time. I still have it and it’s a workhorse, and have put about 15k on it to which It had 60k when I purchased it.
Great buy, and say goodbye to v6 engines as the car companies need to go green and the future is about EV."
"04  5, 2021",Love love love it!,Everything mechanically was checked out and fixed by the dealer before driving off the lot. I love the low miles and great deal I got.
"03 31, 2021",This car is like my old one with way less miles.,It’s like brand new. It’s 4 years newer than my old car that has 260k miles. This has 65k miles. That’s why I bought another one. Love the v6 Rav 4. Hope they make it again.
"02  2, 2021",Best reliable suv I've ever owned,"This SUV didn't only meet my expectations,  it's far surpassed them.  Good on gas,  nice smooth ride,  and has not given me one problem.  2010-2012 is the best year,  that's my opinion."
"01 23, 2021",My favorite vehicle I’ve owned,It is perfect for what I need in a vehicle. Plenty of space to haul whatever I need. I like the styling and the overall design.
"01  3, 2021",Extremely reliable and spacious,"This car was very reliable and spacious. Not much for luxury, but it was a fantastic value, had plenty of space, and was good on gas."
"08 11, 2020",I Love My RAV4!,"I bought my RAV4 in 2015. It was 3 years old with 23,000 miles on it. Five years later I have 117,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier. I take care of normal maintenance and haven't had any unexpected repairs at all. Reliability is of utmost importance to me and its been flawless. I love the interior space and how it sits up high. Its fun to drive and great looking, too. This 2012 RAV4 has been exceptionally good for me."
"08  6, 2020",Very clean car for the money spent!,So far the car is running just fine it had low miles and is in very good shape. It’s hard to find a car this year that doesn’t have a lot of miles!!
"06 22, 2020",Amazing Safety Even Without Fancy Features,"I owned the 2012 RAV-4 from 2015-2020, bought it used. Never had any major maintenance issues even at 70k miles. The only reason I no longer own it is because of an accident; I hydroplaned on the highway, skidded across four lanes of traffic, and slammed into a guardrail—the car was sadly totalled, but there wasn't a single scratch on me. The safety and reliability of this car is unmatched for its class."
"01 27, 2020",This the best value for money car in any segment,"I got the 7 seater 4 cyl with dealer modified Sunroof etc. I fitted a android navigation unit to replace the original CD unit. 
This car never failed in snow, desert, highways or city. I drove it for 65K miles in NJ, CA & GA and it always did the job with very little maintenance like Battery, tires and Brakes. Get tires from tire shop and not from dealer as they sell very bad tires.
It is under powered compared to a V6 only on gradient roads. It can still be quick on the highways."
"01 27, 2020",one of the best cars i ever owned.,"i drove this car for the past five years and no problem ever. It is an 
excellent drive and very low maintenance and fantastic gas millage."
"12 31, 2019",Best affordable car ever!,"Not luxurious, but ROOMY, COMFORTABLE, & RELIABLE. No issues ever!  Perfect seat-height for us seniors. Easy getting in/out. Great, tight turning-radius.  Would definitely buy again."
"12 31, 2019",Love Toyota RAV4 this is my second,I’ve been spoiled for other cars by the RAV4. My last one had over 195k miles. I’m looking for even better longevity with this one.
"12  8, 2019",Very nice comfortable car!,This car has plenty space and not too big. The seats are comfortable. The car is smooth to drive. I liked that car very much.
"11 30, 2019",I heard fantastic things about this vehicle,"Everything I was looking for.  I was looking for something that sat higher, a vehicle with storage space and would do great in all weather conditions."
"11 12, 2019",Tank of a car,"Two weeks and one day after I bought this car I was rear-ended by a Ford focus hatchback.

The girl texting and driving had to have her vehicle towed from the scene, and the spare tire on mine took most of the damage. She still did about $3,000 worth of damage, but I was able to drive away.

The car can use a better sound system, and the seats are okay - but it's a tank in the snow, and so far has been great."
"09  2, 2019",Disappointed ☹️,"The brakes make a clicking noise. The paint is coming off in sheets on the passenger side, and the windshield wipers are almost inoperable. I’ve taken the car in twice and nothing happened. The dealership does not  respond to my questions nor does the manufacturer."
"08 27, 2019",So far it's very nice,"We've only owned it for a little over a week but so far it's been a good vehicle. From experience I know that Toyota makes some very good cars and trucks, that's why we went with this."
"07 18, 2019",Great vehicle for light 4x4,"I've owned this car for almost 4 years now. It has been rock solid from day one, and has never shown any problems. It is just big enough to fit 2 adults and 3 kids (2 in boosters, 1 in car-seat). It has been great for long trips, and gets decent gas mileage.

My biggest complaint about the car was that the cargo door opens up the wrong way. When I park on the right side of the street, the door opens out to the right. So now I can't just unload right onto the curb, I have to carry thing around the door."
"07  7, 2019",Best in Total cost of ownership,"Dealers were nice during maintenance. Yes they were pushy, but I was careful. Don't use stick tires or battery. Costco has better options. Driver seat is not comfortable for a 6 foot folks. I have a seven seater that was used when there are guests."
"06 25, 2019",My last 5 cars have been Toyotas.,Great on back roads.  Toyotas run forever. The only problem is that the last owner was a heavy smoker.  My dealer was great —- I would buy from him again.
"06  5, 2019",Love Love this !!!,"Love the look of the Rav4,  and how much room there is in the back. Can't wait to be riding the roads and showing it off!"
"05  1, 2019","Bought in Blue Springs MO and drove it to LA, CA","This RAV 4 performed really well on a long trip to LA the day after I bought it used. It handled the cold, the desert and the mountains effortlessly.  I would highly recommend buying a used vehicle from Universal Auto Plaza Blue Springs, MO."
"03 22, 2019",Works for my fam!,It’s a great car for nuclear family. I’d recommend it for folks who’d want to go on road trips and have stuff to carry on.
"01 20, 2019",It is the most reliable car.,Yes this car did meet my needs as has always been and I will recommend a friend ant time to buy or service their car .
"10 26, 2018",I love the style size the great pickup from the v,This suv is great meets all my needs that?s why I selected this vehicle plus low maintenance dependable performance reliable handles very well great pickup too
"08 15, 2018",Love this car!,After I broke my hip I had to trade my Fit for a higher sitting car. Thought about a crv but decided on the Rav instead & never regretted my decision.
"07 27, 2018",RAV4 are the best cars we've ever owned!,"Great size, V6 has crazy amazing power, 3 rows of seats in an SUV this size is outstanding. Reliability is top notch and service is a breeze.  Best family car ever with great features for the value.  Our favorite care to date and we've had 3!!!"
"07 26, 2018",I feel safe driving it in really any conditions.,"This car has been great for me!  I needed something that would drive well in the snow, and it has done that and more.  It technically can fit 7 (which is really nice at times) but the back 2 seats have very little legroom, so stick your short friends back there."
"07  3, 2018",Been a great vehicle.,Has met all of my needs. Upkept very well. Never been in the shop except for routine maintenance issues. Only selling because I want to buy a newer model.
"06 21, 2018","great, comfortable car.","I bought this car new and have all of the service records and manuals.  It is a great ride, good visibility, comfortable and reliable. It is a high end model with leather interior and weather tech floor mats. Blue tooth phone connection."
"06 19, 2018",Third RAV4 and looking forward to the next...,I absolutely love my RAV4 - as mentioned this is my third one.  All three of my RAVs were V6 engine - won't buy the 4 cylinder.  The RAV has the largest cargo space of any vehicle in it's class.  Loads of room!  I can't wait for the 2019 - new EVERYTHING - remodeled with technology in mind.  Seriously - you cannot go wrong with a used RAV.  Love my car!
"06 15, 2018",good car for hauling,this has been a very good car for big loads. The only problem is there is not enough leg room for the mean in our family
"06 13, 2018",Excellent car all around!,This is a great car. Never given me any problems. I can haul a ton of stuff. Very comfortable and roomy. I would buy this car again.
"06  6, 2018",Fantastic auto,"We bought our 2012 rav4 sport v6 and new off the lot in 2012.  Been a super vehicle.  Don't listen to others get the v6.  It is far better then the 4 and actually gets better gas mileage.  It has 70,000 miles on it now with absolutely no problems.  I would definitely buy it again."
"06  5, 2018",My Favorite Car!,"I've owned a lot of cars, got to be at least 15, in my life. This one is by far my favorite! It's pretty, fast, reliable and all around everything I love in a car."
"05 29, 2018",love it,"Runs nice, comfortable, lots of room and storage space. I bought it used and it is the best uses car I have purchased to date. Great car, would def recommend to another person"
"05 21, 2018",Great small SUV for the money.,"The RAV4 is s dependable small SUV with excellent intetior space. It is a very good SUV for family trips that require space for luggage, coolers and sports gear."
"05  6, 2018",They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!,Great ride and much sportier to drive than the larger Highlander and 4 Runner.  The interior layout is perfect!  The cargo area is probably the largest in the compact SUV class (at this time).  Too bad you can no longer get a V6 option (2012 was the last year):  That makes this great car truly outstanding!
"05  4, 2018",LOVE THIS CAR,"VERY NICE CONDITION, LIKE THE AMENITIES, DRIVES GREAT AND I HOPE IT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY IT OFF -- LOOKING FORWAARD TO DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT"
"05  3, 2018",Excellent transportation in the winter,Perfect family vehicle. Roomy. Gas mileage was as good as I?ve gotten. Long road trips were made w/ it on a monthly basis. Never had a single issue.
"05  2, 2018",Most reliable vehicle ever,"My 2012 Toyota RAV4 has been a great friend to me. It has helped tremendously in every winter storm for the last three years. Cheap on gas, extremely reliable, this is definitely an excellent vehicle!!"
"04 13, 2018",Fun drive,A very fun drive and a lot of space. We used it for moving stuff all the time. Great drive for snow days. Great value and gas mileage.
"04 11, 2018",Excellent Vehicle,"Powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride. Very reliable. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I do not expect to ever sell it."
"03  3, 2018",I so in love with this car very reliable,Omg fits my needs love the space something different it's fits me.and all love the storage space as well best vehicle every the kids love it great price.
"02 24, 2018",Great Reliability and Practicality,"Very reliable
Cheap to maintain
Holds value very good as for a used car
I recommend to buy 4cylinder with all wheel drive, most popular model and will always have demend"
"02 20, 2018","Why do my lights keep comeing on,4x4, traction con","The rav4 comes up with a code o2 sensor, bank 1 sensor 2. You change it then comes rite back on along with 4?4  light and traction control  light. So you change it again. 17 miles latter they are back on .  Why. Alot of people are having same problem"
"02  7, 2018",One of the best Vehicle that I owned,I owned and driven 100s of cars in my lifetime. I worked at many car rental companies for 20 years. This vehicle will always my top recommendation to everyone
"02  3, 2018",Great looking and fun to drive car!,"I am a big Toyota fan with this 2012 RAV4 being the 7th Toyota I have owned.  They have all been very reliable, fun to drive, and go forever.   This is the first time I have owned a RAV4 though but so far so good as it seems to represent the Toyota brand like all others.  It is comfortable with the basic options, powerful enough with the 4-cylinder engine, and feels very safe driving.   Great car!"
"01 29, 2018",very stable free way driving,itsan amazing Small SUV.  lots of room for cargo. fun to drive. very good on gasoline. small enough to fit a any space like regular car.
"01 23, 2018",great Car!,"I got this car in 2015. I got it used with 18k miles on it.  I use it as my daily driver  and it's perfect  for San franciscos pothole filled streets. Though it's only a 2wheel drive, I have taken her camping to Yosemite, death valley, Zion, grand staircase escalante, Bruce canyon, Vegas, l.a., tahoe. it's great for camping for 2 people as you can fit lots of stuff in the back with the seats down. you can travel with 2 people in the back on long drives but the back seats need much better cushioning. 3 in the back is fine but might be uncomfortable for long drives. your passengers must really like each other. back seats recline. I also used my rav for moving and hauling Ikea items. the 176hp is sufficient enough for me. it has good pick up. the one I have is the standard 2wd. I think I would opt for 4wd next time just because I like to travel to more places."
"01 18, 2018","Rav 4, the car to have in the winter","An excellent vehicle for us.  It is a V6 so it has plenty of hustle in traffic and the  mpg's we get is very satisfactory at 25 on trips and 23 -24 around town.  An excellent vehicle for winter driving as well.   I would recommend a Rav, but only if the V6 was brought back.  Too bad it is no longer available in newer models."
"01 12, 2018",Best car I've ever owned!,"I love this vehicle! Well-made, safe, solid, fuel-efficient, comfortable, with lots of smart and convenient design features. Bought used from Toyota on the Park -- what a great deal and great dealership!"
"01  8, 2018",Toyota Rav4 Limited Excellent style and performanc,This SUV is comfortable with excellent head and leg room. Comfortable for Highway Travel long distances. Heated seats for winter. Driver and passenger visibility is outstanding. Dual comfort climate control makes it nice in summer and winter. Dependable with good gas mileage for full passengers and cargo ride.
"11 17, 2017",One of the greatest crossovers to ever exist!,"I own the basic 4WD V6 RAV4 2012 Model, yes the last V6 Model every made by Toyota. This car made it through a 36 hour drive to Georgia and back with no problems! The vehicle performance is similar to a Camry Sport feel, and the acceleration is powerful! It feels like I'm sitting in a  race car when I hop behind the wheel of my RAV4. If you are able to find one, get one. The 2013 and up models do not compare to this beast."
"11  7, 2017","Five years, 80.000 miles",One minor repair in all this time.  29.5mpg overall. Love the driving position and the handling of the vehicle.
"11  5, 2017",Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned,I love the reliability of my RAV4 and how it performs. I have owned or leased many cars.. Best brand
"11  3, 2017",Best Car Ever,"I love this car so much. It is comfortable and reliable, with tons of trunk space and good visibility."
"10 27, 2017",Fantastic SUV,"I love my Rav4. There's a lot more room than you would think. It comfortably fits 5, with lots of trunk space. I can't wait to test the 4WD this winter!"
"10 14, 2017","Overall OK, but need input.","I have a 2012 Rav4, (5 years old) Overall the car has been a good investment.  I have had a problem with the service lights on the dash, (Service Engine, 4-WD, and Track Off) remaining on. I had the O2 sensor replaced as the code read indicated was the problem. A few miles down the road  after the repair, the lights came on again, and the O2 sensor was again listed as the problem.  There are many people on-line with the same problem, (some have paid thousands of dollars trying to find the cause).  Toyota told me it was my car and that I should continue spending money to find out the problem.  Anyone else with this vehicle that might have suggestions?  I'm pretty frustrated with Toyota right now and wanted to share this concern to other owners who might have the same issues.  Other than that, the car works fine."
"10  9, 2017",Another Excellent Toyota Car,"I've owned my RAV4 since 2012 and I love it. I never had any problems with it since. I trust the brand name Toyota for its excellent commitment to their customers. I am not a car enthusiast but i know that if you want a vehicle for keeps, get a Toyota."
"10  6, 2017",great replacement for crv...,"hoping for best here....bought to replace older Honda crv--this has last year of v6 engine with heavy tow  package, so i can tow more than the Honda 1600 # limit.....although  rides stiffer due to run-flat tires and sport suspension tuning.....but everything else is what i wanted."
"10  2, 2017",Great SUV,"Love the 2012 RAV4 Limited with 4WD, 25 mpg, heated seats, remote start, backup camera, Bluetooth, and more. Mine has had bullet proof reliability and low maintenance costs. I wish the driver's seat was more comfortable and the interior design was upgraded. It has a huge amount of cargo room and I like the side opening tail gate."
"09 19, 2017",Great Reliable Car for the money,"Good car, rides well, good in snow -  a good safe car.  It was rated well for safety.  It is not a fast car, however drives well."
"09 15, 2017",Very happy Rav4 owner,"I havent had my Rav4 long, but i absolutely love it.  It seems very versatile and adequate for darn near anything.  I've been surprised by the power it has despite being a four cyclinder yet stays very efficient as well.  I like the interior design but do wish for a little more leg room for the backseat.  I prefer the boxier maybe jeepier look of the 2012 and older but i have heard friends with this era model complain about the rear door being too heavy with the spare tire, and that they have trouble closing while parked on a hill and that the hinges are insufficient.  I bought mine used and while the door seems fine it does rattle a bit upon closing.  I needed a family vehicle and efficient commuter car with awd and this hits all the boxes and then some.  All with Toyota's legendary reliability.  Im a person who wants to be in love with his vehicle and keep it til it dies and i imagine im gonna have this Rav4 for a long time!"
"09  5, 2017",Reliability is what I look for in a car,This car is nice looking car that is reliability. I found this car drives well on winter snow and ice. There is space to hold 5 adults and luggage for travel. I recommend this car. In fact I own two Rav4 cars.
"09  1, 2017",Overall great vehicle!,"We needed a vehicle larger than a car, but smaller than an SUV and this is the perfect size. Reliable, comfortable & plenty of truck space for traveling."
"08 19, 2017",Realiable as always in a Toyota,"Great riding vehicle and it handles excellent... also good vehicle for the price ...it's a sporty, SUV and it's the best as far as reliability.."
"08 18, 2017",This car met all my needs.,Very close to my former Lexus RX330 I used to own. Very spacious and great driving for bad weather condition.
"08  9, 2017",Great vehicle - very reliable,"I have really enjoyed owning my 2012 RAV4 Sport V6 - easy to drive, easy to park, handles like a sports car, great in the mountains and the snow. It is big enough for a small family of 4, has enough cargo room for normal jobs, and with the V6 and trailer hitch can tow my small utility trailer or 1500lb boat with ease. I'm just sad they don't make this vehicle / engine combo any longer - don't know what I will replace it with when it is time."
"07 22, 2017",Rad RAV4,"I LOVE being a RAV4 driver. This car is my pride and joy. Reliable and very attractive. 
I have the limited model, so the vehicle has leather/heated seats, a moon/sunroof, backup camera, and all the bells and whistles. It is absolutely my dream car. Toyota's are great cars and this is no exception. However, I do not care much for the body style of the RAV4's after 2012, so anything 2013+ does not interest me much. 

A used RAV will serve you well! The gas mileage is good for an SUV/crossover. Spacious on the inside with LOTS of trunk room. 

Love this car!"
"07  1, 2017",Beautiful car,"Driving this car, I knew right away that tho car was for me. Perfect size for my family of 5.  Beautiful inside and out, lots of technology."
"07  1, 2017",Great car,"Wonderful car, has a ton of room for my family of 5. Comfortable, and was built well and very reliable."
"06 26, 2017",Love the V6 engine!!,"I love having the extra power of the V6 because I drive in the mountains often. I wish I had a sunroof and feel like the space in the front seats could be designed better. Like having more compartments for phone, purse, etc would be nice. I love how the seats lay down flat in the back and I can sleep back there when I'm camping. Also love the extra storage compartment in the back where the spare tire would normally be."
"06 18, 2017",not my favorite car that i have owned,it meets my needs i dont have any problems with it but it is not very comfortable and it is not the best looking car in the world
"06 12, 2017",One of the safest cars by consumer reports!,"Awesome! I feel that it is one of the safest vehicles for my family to ride in. I love it, and it is very reliable, sporty, fun vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Easy to drive,The Rav4 is easy to drive and handles well. The turning radius is the smallest I have ever experienced.  The wheel lock button should be useful for getting out of snow or ice or mud. The interior has lots of space when the seats fold down. Highly recommended.
"05 23, 2017",IT IS OKAY IF YOU ARE BYE YOURSELF,"OKAY. at the time i needed something to go back and forth to GA it serve it purposed for what I need it for. If you are a big person it is not a good truck to have to small for anyone over 5 ft.
other wise it is a good truck. good on gas."
"05 23, 2017","Toyota Rav4, sensible and reliable","Bought my 2012 Rav4 new in 2012. 46k miles later, no repairs other than brakes and tires. Reliable , comfortable, love my heated seats.  Wish the engine and road noise weren't so loud."
"05 12, 2017",Very Reliable,Its good its got good mileage it got a good doors. its got good wheels. all four wheels work really well. everythings pretty good the seats are very comfortable
"04 24, 2017",Great Toyota product,I love my Rav4 and plan to be buying a new one in the next year or so very likely!  Toyota has been the most reliable trouble free vehicles I have ever owned and would not think of switching brands!
"04 10, 2017",Reliable & Versatile,It's been very reliable and versatile. Great for getting to work and for transporting larger items. It's easy to drive and has good gas mileage.
"03 21, 2017",Best car yet.,"Purchased my Rav4 through Prestige Toyota of Kingston. Joseph Rodelli has the patience of a saint! Took me a while to make up my mind, but I'm definitely pleased with my purchase."
"03 10, 2017",2012 Toyota RAV4,"The Toyota RAV4 is a great car. It's reliable, safe, spacious, sleek, and has all the basic features you would want your car to have. I've never had an issue with my car, I trust it completely. The seats aren't as comfortable as some other cars, but that's not too big of a deal to me. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a safe, gas efficient car."
"03  9, 2017",We love our used RAV4!,"It's beautiful, comfortable, well-designed, efficient, a dream to drive, and it was such a great deal from Toyota On The Park in Toronto. Great dealership and repair place. We are 100% happy. Love it!"
"05 28, 2016",Nice small car,You don't need the v 6.  3 row seat is a waist of money.Not comfortable to drive if over six foot.Weak a.c.. Nice car and runs good but get a loaded limited..
"06 10, 2015",Rav4,"Love my new Rav4. I've only had it a week, but I can tell you, I feel safe in it and secure with my decision in purchasing one. Toyota's are dependable, safe and they hold their value for years to come. I would recommend one to anybody. Great car!"
"03 11, 2014",The most valuable small SUV,"I purchased 2012 Sport V4 model to replace 2005 Sienna Van. I rented a Hyundi Santa Fe for roadtrip before my purchsing. I also tested Nissan Rouge and Honda CRV. Rav4 and Honda CRV were on the final run. I choice Toyota because the package met my need for the price that I expected.

Less than one year later, my wife purchased the 2013 CRV base model.

Now, I can tell you the true experience of these two competitors as the user.

They both have same performance.

Rav4 2012 is the last year of the old model. Its interior was designed for V6 w/7 seat optiopn. The 2nd row seat can be slided back and forth. My 5 seat get extra leg room when I push back. Because mine is 5 seat model. It has X-extra huge cargo space. Put down the 2nd row seat, I can still get a flat space like a bed when I going out for camping like driving Sienna van. The 6 speakers audio has excellent sound quality. The only Con's for this car from my experience are 2:
1. The doors are very light, so most of times I have push a little when closing the door.
2. The gas tank is only 12 gal. I believe this is a compromise for the other X-extra features for 7 seat option. I believe this has been changed to 16 gal. in 2013 new model. Of cause, you will not get those X-extra space from 2013 model.
My Sport model come with roof window, rack, buletooth and MP3, USB and back-up camera.
I used to buy long lumbers from HomeDepot when I drove Sienna van. Although Rav4 is not as long as Sienna van , I can still buy plenty of 2x6x(8+ size). My Rav4 Sport model has #3 gear which help picking up speed on highway when I need.

Honda has better interior (roomy). The windshield was pushed forward with wider glass to get more space. The interior width is also a little wider than Rav4. The driver's seat has arm rest which is good for long trip. The back-up camera(rear monitor) has become standard feature which is very thoughtful for high position vehicle. The cargo space is huge too. CRV has smaller turning radious for you make U-turn.

They both make you feel very steady while driving on the curving road. They both very reliable, comfort, good driver's view to all around the traffic. The price is difficult to compare each other. I will think they are pretty much the same if same features, but unfortuantely their different trims equipted with different features.

Toyota Rav4 (even though 2013 model) is a little sporty looking while CRV is more like city car. You shall pick what you need. You will like either one. Both Toyota and Honda make good value products.

So far, I have 10500 miles on my Rav4 and over 5000 miles on CRV.

My Rav4 perform 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the roadtrip with premium gas.

My wife has never counted the mpg for her CRV. I think it is about the same in city. I guess the roadtrip mpg shall be a little better if we try Eco-mode. She mentioned one time about Eco-mode and said ""You don't want use this feature in the town even though on highway because the system will run with less power."" I guess that Eco-mode will be very helpful if we go for roadtrip in Wild West.

Hope these true experience are helpful for you."
"01 24, 2014",Great buy,"We really like this car! Got it because we're expecting a baby and wNt something reliable and functional. We got it from Maguire Toyota in Ithaca, NY, and Bridget helped us. She was fantastic- never pressured us, just showed us everything we wanted to see, gave us more information, and answered all our questions. We'll be going back there for our next vehicle purchase,"
"11 25, 2013","Like the car, but. . .","RAV is a good choice, generally. Can't beat it for dependability, resale, etc. Not very exciting in the interior, although it's OK. I like the external spare, but that's going away, along with leather seat covers and V6 power. Uses tons of fuel, but that's true with the smaller engine as well."
"09  8, 2013","Very good on gas milage, reliable and beautiful.","Very good on gas milage.
Nice,cozy interior and beautifully crafted exterior.
Spacious trunk for shopping and for reasonable haulage.
Easily accessible driving features and equiped with some modern car technology. Loving It."
"07 28, 2013",Loving it!,"Looks great, drives great. I bought it for the AWD feature for winter driving. I'm happy it will have the power when I need it, and has great gas mileage."
"07 22, 2013",My Dream UV I Never Knew!,"I am amazed at the comfort and security this vehicle gives me once I get behind the wheel. The difference in the gas mileage expenditure has improved from day one. I love the GPS feature and Blue tooth, which have come in so handy for me with my kids/family/co-workers! I love my Rav4! THANKS JESSE!!"
"03  7, 2013",great car!,The seller and finance personnel were all very helpful and proffessional. But best of all i got the best deal in the market! I love my new toyota rav4!!!
"02 28, 2013",AWESOME!,"We just love this vehicle! Within 15 minutes of purchasing I was traveling 300 miles. It rode smoothly, I feel safe in it, comfy...simple WE LOVE IT!"
"02 23, 2013",like the v6 power. Goooooo,"I have a 2007 Rav4 and use it for travel. The V6 give you the option of getting out of the way or hitting the brakes. the interstates are test of survival. So when I found out that toyota was getting rid of the V6 safety feature, I purchased the 2012 with the V6. Now the 2013 Rav4 looks like all the rest. Oh hum"
"01 29, 2013",Mitsubishi,"Happy with car after purchase. There is nothing more to say than, what a nice car. It was the cae that caught my eye on the road"
"01 24, 2013",Found a great car at a great price,"Haven't had it long enough to really tell yet, but so far, I am more than satisfied. The ride is a little stiff. The gas mileage has been better than expected."
"01 22, 2013",Great Solid Driver,"Drove them all found the Rav 4 to be the most solid feeling Cross over in it's class. Nice feel on the hi-way, great brakes, comfortable firm but not harsh ride."
"01 17, 2013",Bought Toyotas since 1976,"We've bought Toyotas since we were married in 1976. We have found them to be very realiable. We're had corolla, camrays, Supra, Thundra, other trucks, and this is my second Rav 4"
"01 15, 2013",Outstanding buying expierence!,"As a long term West Herr customer, I recently referred a friend to ""Casey Mac Alpine"" at West Herr Toyota of Williamsville. Just wanted to express the great customer service that my friend received from ""Casey""which was ""Class A all the way. She mentioned that this was the best car buying experience that she has ever had in the many years of dealing with sales people. She felt that the he listened and cared!"
"01 14, 2013",Fun little in-town car,"Fun to drive, Not a luxury car, nice little commuter that holds a lot. Great on gas. I use the Rav4 to get to and from work about 5 miles each way. I also have horses and need to hall feed from time to time and this little SUV does it all. Recently put 10 bags of shavings in it with no trouble at all. I needed a car with good gas mileage and could hall feed, and large dogs. This Rav4 seems to do it all with ease. So far I love it. Don't think i would like it on a long trip."
"01  9, 2013",best suv,looks great feels good great ride. Has many extra's and toyota is big on all the small details and extras
"01  6, 2013",Worst experience,"First off, my family has always owned a Toyota and NEVER ever had problems. We were always satisfied by how reliable the quality of Toyota vehicles were.

With an almost 1 yr old and me being pregnant, my husband and I decided we needed to buy a brand new car. He wanted a Ford or Jeep, but I insisted on Toyota. I did so much research and showed him all the great consumer and expert reviews on the Rav4. He finally caved in and we bought a brand new 2012 Rav4.

We got it in August 2012 and loved it! But then 3 months later (1,200 mileage only) in November (we live in the UK by the way, stationed in England), it broke down on me and my daughter at night in the cold. We were stuck for 1.5hr trying to get help and then finally a friend was able to get us but he tried to drive it too, and it broke down on him too. I know my prego hormones were out of wack, but it was awful and my daughter was crying hysterically by the way. We were cold and scared!

My husband tried to drive it to the Cambridge Toyota center but it broke down on him too and he had to wait 4hrs and 40 mins for someone to tow it to the dealership.

Then it took almost 2 weeks to figure out what was wrong with it. My husband who was deploying the following week at first was asking friends for rides to his deployment appointments and briefings, but since it was taking longer than expected we had to rent a car (which is not covered by warranty). It was just the worst timing ever.

The fuel pump pressure was defective. Warranty covered it and is ""fixed"" they say, but apparently it is still causing problems because our neighbors who are currently watching the car for us (they'll be watching it for about 6 months) says it still runs when they drive it, but it feels like it might stall at stops. It hasn't stalled yet, but STILL, what safety is that?!

Sorry Toyota, this experience totally made me never want to own one, and not only do I feel betrayed by Toyota's reliable past, I also feel like I disrespected my husband by not considering the Ford or Jeep he wanted. Should have just listened to him and trusted him!

Totally disappointed and not looking forward to going back to the UK to drive a potentially hazardous car for our family."
"12 20, 2012",G-Man,"This is the third Rav4 I've owned. They never disappoint. Excellent performance, comfort, and very
reliable. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space, comes in
handy, on many occasions. Living in New England, the
Rav4, enables you to drive in any condition, with confidence. I've had a direct influence on six friends,
who also purchased Rav4's."
"12 19, 2012",RECOMMEND TO ALL,"CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, RECOMMEND TO ALL.PERFECT SO EASY TO DRIVE, WARRENTY IS GREAT, MAINTANCE IS EXCELLENT."
"12 10, 2012",Excellent!,"Best car I've ever owned ... I traded a 2009 RAV4 for my 2012! Great mileage, comfort, style, perfect for toting my amps and guitars to gigs. Love it!"
"10 31, 2012",RAV,"This is the fourth Toyota in our household and my second RAV4. My first RAV4 was 12yrs old, and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was to get the down payment to buy a newer one. I got a great price when I sold my 2001 RAV4 - had I been able to keep the old one and still buy the new one, I would have b/c I LOVE my RAVs!"
"10 26, 2012",Excellent little car,Care has plenty of pep and get-up-and-go for a 4-cylinder engine. The handling is superb. Very pleased with leg room. Good dependable care for the money. Would recommend to a friend
"10 22, 2012",The RAV4 Sport,"Fabulous vehicle, way more room than the Honda CR-V! Strongly influenced by owning a 2003 Matrix for 8 years! Durable, long lasting, and reliable! Never doubted the vehicle for a second! I am very happy about my Dad's advice and gearing me towards a RAV4 Sport! Absolutely outstanding. My husband jokingly and lovingly says; ""All you ever do is have a nicer car than your husband!""

Love it!"
"10 17, 2012",Very comfortable,"I'm 6'4"" with arthritis in knees and hips. The RAV4 allows me to travel for more than 1 1/2 hrs before I need to stop to relieve knee and hip pain. There is also more than ample headroom."
"09 28, 2012",Need more seat time to be totally objective,"Great mid size SUV.
Good Fuel economy.
Great Ride with good cornering stability.
Toyo Open country tires noisy on some furfaces."
"09 23, 2012",Safe and Reliable Small SUV,"This is the second RAV4 we have owned. It is a nice little SUV for our needs, we purchased for reliability and the value we got for the money. Very easy to drive and has all the safety features you need in a modern vehicle including the backup camera. Plenty of room in the back for all our stuff and a Kayak on top of the racks. Plus my wife likes how the higher stance of the vehicle gives her a better view of the road. The RAV4 fits our lifestyle and needs."
"09 21, 2012",32 mpg on hwy,"minimum 28 mpg through yellowstone, tetons,rockies. almost drives itself.only a four cylinder but plenty power."
"09 10, 2012",Just another car,"It is an okay car, if my Honda was not totaled I would not have bought this. According to the on car mpg gauge we are only getting 21 mpg."
"08 24, 2012",Rav4 Review,"Stylish , Innovative, Contemporary Toyota Moving Forward! Vast Improvement over last years mOdel, no recalls yet?"
"08 24, 2012",My New Rav 4,"I've been a Toyota person forever. Prior to this SUV, I had a Yaris - which is fantastic on gas. I needed a vehicle for the snow, plus a larger one for my dogs. I absolutely love my SUV, roomy enough, and it sits high enough (like a truck) so I can see past the vehicle ahead of me. It rides so smootlhly and I can't wait to use all the gadgets I've never had before in a car. For a larger vehicle that I am used to - it is doing exceptionally well on gas. (I average 26.5 mpg) This is in the city - mind you. This is also the first vehicle I've had which is automatic. I have to remind myself not to shift & not to clutch. Other than this, I love my new Rav-ioli."
"08 23, 2012",Better than govt. motors,Got tired of poor quality of gm dealers. Tired of their shoddy service and excuses. Bought Toyota. Best personal service of dealers and sales. Most courteous and genuine. WONT GO BACK TO GM.
"08 23, 2012",Raving over the Rav 4,"It took me a long time to settle on and buy exactly what I wanted. The Toyota Rav 4 Sport V6. It's fun to drive, surprisingly quick and responsive, looks amazing (sport w/appearance package) and toyota's reliability is bar none. I wish that they offered navigation systems in the other models besides the limited, but I'll just have to use the maps on my smart phone. Great all round, 4 seasons car."
"08 21, 2012",love my suv,It is what I wanted and thank the dealer for making it possible. Love the way it drives and the way it looks.
"08 14, 2012",RAV4 SPORT RED,"I bought RAV4 Sport, ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy... if you driving by yourself, I guess it?s O.K.. it?s not good for family ride. First couple of years I use to get good gas mileage, then it?s drop to around 17-19 miles? I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. If I wait till 5K there won't be any oil to change, it burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 3 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's normal. What I am hearing and reading almost all the TOYOTA cars are BURNING OIL like crazy. Now I just add oil every other month, seems like I made a big mistake buying the RAV4,, after 4-recall I think I am done with TOYOTA!!"
"07 12, 2012",Must have,I love this car and the stylish new look. I have the sport and it's a beautiful SUV. Must have........
"06 29, 2012",now a two rav4 family,the 97 rav 4 is sweet with no problems other than normal service which is expected so we added a new one to the family which is the 2012 rav4 limited and passed on the 4 wheel drive and 6 cylinder as we live in Florida and wanted the best millage and did not have the need for a 6 or 4x4 as our new 2012 rav has more power than the 97 which is fine everywhere fully loaded with camp equipment except for going up mountains where I could not even meet the 55 mph speed limit so expect the new rav to hanndle that even better
"05  6, 2012",2nd Toyota SUV - after Chevys and Benzs...,"Since last few weeks I am enjoying my new 2012 Toyota RAV4 Sport 4WD, it is really a nice vehicle.
Bluetooth works great, Fuel wise is also very echonomical, drive smooth."
"04 19, 2012",2nd RAV 4 I've Owned,"This is the 2nd RAV 4 I've Owned. Traded in a 2002 Model RAV 4 for the 2012 Model. It's quite different and I still love it. It's larger, roomier and still great to handle. I especially like the roomier back seat and the larger cargo area. Looked at some competitor's vehicles but came back to the RAV 4 mostly for the reliability and great value."
"04 16, 2012",My Rav,"This is the best car i ever own, I always wanted it. If I didnt get it I woudnt feel right. When you really want something you have to go for it!!"
"04 12, 2012",Love it so far,"I just got my 2012 Rav4 a few weeks ago and took it on a 14 hours round trip to Virginia with no problems. I averaged 25mpg- not awesome but I'll take it. It was very car-like and easy to handle and also very comfortable. Visibility was fine. You do have to watch for wind - common with taller cars but I was driving a tiny sedan previously so it was not something I was used to right away. I love the bluetooth capability and the controls on the dash - something I did not really think I would care about. Since I went from CNY (40 degrees) to Va (65 degrees) I got to use both heat and a/c: both were fine. Lots of storage space throughout. My friend just traded in her 12 year old Rav 4 with over 140,000mi on it. I hope mine lasts that long!"
"11  9, 2023",Insufficient time line for Blizzard Pearl recall.,"The exterior received 1 star as the Blizzard Pearl paint looked great before its now ongoing pealing frenzy. 
The 2012 RAV4 is great in every aspect for its generation though the Blizzard Pearl isn’t holding up. 
The Blizzard Pearl paint, as good looking as it is, or paint prep is failing in a big way. The roof was pealing above the windshield aprox. 4 years ago, its repainting was cover per the extended warranty. Now 1 year after the warranty expired the hood, drivers side front post, drivers side passenger door and the rear hatch are all pealing. Blizzard Pearl! It’s now a looker going down the road for a different reason."
"07  6, 2023",To many problems in this Suv,This SUV HAS A SO MUCH PROBLEM I HAVE 2012 RAV4 51000 MILES IN MY SUV BURN OIL WHEEL SENIOR NO GOOD AIR BEG PROBLEM SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND FEW MORE PROBLEM WITH 2012 TOYOTA RAV4
"04 14, 2023",2012 Rav 4 is a gem.,I had a 2012 Rav 4 and a man ran a red light and ran over me and the Rav had to be junked. I got my second 2012 Rav 4 and both were and are wonderful cars. Would highly reccommend.
"01 27, 2023","RAV4 Sport v6, no better price for a 4WD","I had researched small/compact SUV vehicles in their respective class. Toyota known for reliability and quality for the price was on top of my list.
It took me a years time to have gotten lucky enough on a trade in at a local dealer. My timing was right on as when I arrived l looked it over before speaking with a rep. I overheard employees saying that the RAV4 Sport v6 check all the boxes and was a unicorn in and out. The owner must have taken a hit which after test driving it, it was straight as an arrow with minor slight blemishes for a 8 year old vehicle. I knew to make an offer, which was listed at $15,500. It was the end of the month, so it was approved to sell at $1000. Off if I took it that day. “Deal” and ever since driving it away with my temporary papers, I knew I found the SUV 4WD I’ve been looking for.
Right place, right time. I still have it and it’s a workhorse, and have put about 15k on it to which It had 60k when I purchased it.
Great buy, and say goodbye to v6 engines as the car companies need to go green and the future is about EV."
"04  5, 2021",Love love love it!,Everything mechanically was checked out and fixed by the dealer before driving off the lot. I love the low miles and great deal I got.
"03 31, 2021",This car is like my old one with way less miles.,It’s like brand new. It’s 4 years newer than my old car that has 260k miles. This has 65k miles. That’s why I bought another one. Love the v6 Rav 4. Hope they make it again.
"02  2, 2021",Best reliable suv I've ever owned,"This SUV didn't only meet my expectations,  it's far surpassed them.  Good on gas,  nice smooth ride,  and has not given me one problem.  2010-2012 is the best year,  that's my opinion."
"01 23, 2021",My favorite vehicle I’ve owned,It is perfect for what I need in a vehicle. Plenty of space to haul whatever I need. I like the styling and the overall design.
"01  3, 2021",Extremely reliable and spacious,"This car was very reliable and spacious. Not much for luxury, but it was a fantastic value, had plenty of space, and was good on gas."
"08 11, 2020",I Love My RAV4!,"I bought my RAV4 in 2015. It was 3 years old with 23,000 miles on it. Five years later I have 117,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier. I take care of normal maintenance and haven't had any unexpected repairs at all. Reliability is of utmost importance to me and its been flawless. I love the interior space and how it sits up high. Its fun to drive and great looking, too. This 2012 RAV4 has been exceptionally good for me."
"08  6, 2020",Very clean car for the money spent!,So far the car is running just fine it had low miles and is in very good shape. It’s hard to find a car this year that doesn’t have a lot of miles!!
"06 22, 2020",Amazing Safety Even Without Fancy Features,"I owned the 2012 RAV-4 from 2015-2020, bought it used. Never had any major maintenance issues even at 70k miles. The only reason I no longer own it is because of an accident; I hydroplaned on the highway, skidded across four lanes of traffic, and slammed into a guardrail—the car was sadly totalled, but there wasn't a single scratch on me. The safety and reliability of this car is unmatched for its class."
"01 27, 2020",This the best value for money car in any segment,"I got the 7 seater 4 cyl with dealer modified Sunroof etc. I fitted a android navigation unit to replace the original CD unit. 
This car never failed in snow, desert, highways or city. I drove it for 65K miles in NJ, CA & GA and it always did the job with very little maintenance like Battery, tires and Brakes. Get tires from tire shop and not from dealer as they sell very bad tires.
It is under powered compared to a V6 only on gradient roads. It can still be quick on the highways."
"01 27, 2020",one of the best cars i ever owned.,"i drove this car for the past five years and no problem ever. It is an 
excellent drive and very low maintenance and fantastic gas millage."
"12 31, 2019",Best affordable car ever!,"Not luxurious, but ROOMY, COMFORTABLE, & RELIABLE. No issues ever!  Perfect seat-height for us seniors. Easy getting in/out. Great, tight turning-radius.  Would definitely buy again."
"12 31, 2019",Love Toyota RAV4 this is my second,I’ve been spoiled for other cars by the RAV4. My last one had over 195k miles. I’m looking for even better longevity with this one.
"12  8, 2019",Very nice comfortable car!,This car has plenty space and not too big. The seats are comfortable. The car is smooth to drive. I liked that car very much.
"11 30, 2019",I heard fantastic things about this vehicle,"Everything I was looking for.  I was looking for something that sat higher, a vehicle with storage space and would do great in all weather conditions."
"11 12, 2019",Tank of a car,"Two weeks and one day after I bought this car I was rear-ended by a Ford focus hatchback.

The girl texting and driving had to have her vehicle towed from the scene, and the spare tire on mine took most of the damage. She still did about $3,000 worth of damage, but I was able to drive away.

The car can use a better sound system, and the seats are okay - but it's a tank in the snow, and so far has been great."
"09  2, 2019",Disappointed ☹️,"The brakes make a clicking noise. The paint is coming off in sheets on the passenger side, and the windshield wipers are almost inoperable. I’ve taken the car in twice and nothing happened. The dealership does not  respond to my questions nor does the manufacturer."
"08 27, 2019",So far it's very nice,"We've only owned it for a little over a week but so far it's been a good vehicle. From experience I know that Toyota makes some very good cars and trucks, that's why we went with this."
"07 18, 2019",Great vehicle for light 4x4,"I've owned this car for almost 4 years now. It has been rock solid from day one, and has never shown any problems. It is just big enough to fit 2 adults and 3 kids (2 in boosters, 1 in car-seat). It has been great for long trips, and gets decent gas mileage.

My biggest complaint about the car was that the cargo door opens up the wrong way. When I park on the right side of the street, the door opens out to the right. So now I can't just unload right onto the curb, I have to carry thing around the door."
"07  7, 2019",Best in Total cost of ownership,"Dealers were nice during maintenance. Yes they were pushy, but I was careful. Don't use stick tires or battery. Costco has better options. Driver seat is not comfortable for a 6 foot folks. I have a seven seater that was used when there are guests."
"06 25, 2019",My last 5 cars have been Toyotas.,Great on back roads.  Toyotas run forever. The only problem is that the last owner was a heavy smoker.  My dealer was great —- I would buy from him again.
"06  5, 2019",Love Love this !!!,"Love the look of the Rav4,  and how much room there is in the back. Can't wait to be riding the roads and showing it off!"
"05  1, 2019","Bought in Blue Springs MO and drove it to LA, CA","This RAV 4 performed really well on a long trip to LA the day after I bought it used. It handled the cold, the desert and the mountains effortlessly.  I would highly recommend buying a used vehicle from Universal Auto Plaza Blue Springs, MO."
"03 22, 2019",Works for my fam!,It’s a great car for nuclear family. I’d recommend it for folks who’d want to go on road trips and have stuff to carry on.
"01 20, 2019",It is the most reliable car.,Yes this car did meet my needs as has always been and I will recommend a friend ant time to buy or service their car .
"10 26, 2018",I love the style size the great pickup from the v,This suv is great meets all my needs that?s why I selected this vehicle plus low maintenance dependable performance reliable handles very well great pickup too
"08 15, 2018",Love this car!,After I broke my hip I had to trade my Fit for a higher sitting car. Thought about a crv but decided on the Rav instead & never regretted my decision.
"07 27, 2018",RAV4 are the best cars we've ever owned!,"Great size, V6 has crazy amazing power, 3 rows of seats in an SUV this size is outstanding. Reliability is top notch and service is a breeze.  Best family car ever with great features for the value.  Our favorite care to date and we've had 3!!!"
"07 26, 2018",I feel safe driving it in really any conditions.,"This car has been great for me!  I needed something that would drive well in the snow, and it has done that and more.  It technically can fit 7 (which is really nice at times) but the back 2 seats have very little legroom, so stick your short friends back there."
"07  3, 2018",Been a great vehicle.,Has met all of my needs. Upkept very well. Never been in the shop except for routine maintenance issues. Only selling because I want to buy a newer model.
"06 21, 2018","great, comfortable car.","I bought this car new and have all of the service records and manuals.  It is a great ride, good visibility, comfortable and reliable. It is a high end model with leather interior and weather tech floor mats. Blue tooth phone connection."
"06 19, 2018",Third RAV4 and looking forward to the next...,I absolutely love my RAV4 - as mentioned this is my third one.  All three of my RAVs were V6 engine - won't buy the 4 cylinder.  The RAV has the largest cargo space of any vehicle in it's class.  Loads of room!  I can't wait for the 2019 - new EVERYTHING - remodeled with technology in mind.  Seriously - you cannot go wrong with a used RAV.  Love my car!
"06 15, 2018",good car for hauling,this has been a very good car for big loads. The only problem is there is not enough leg room for the mean in our family
"06 13, 2018",Excellent car all around!,This is a great car. Never given me any problems. I can haul a ton of stuff. Very comfortable and roomy. I would buy this car again.
"06  6, 2018",Fantastic auto,"We bought our 2012 rav4 sport v6 and new off the lot in 2012.  Been a super vehicle.  Don't listen to others get the v6.  It is far better then the 4 and actually gets better gas mileage.  It has 70,000 miles on it now with absolutely no problems.  I would definitely buy it again."
"06  5, 2018",My Favorite Car!,"I've owned a lot of cars, got to be at least 15, in my life. This one is by far my favorite! It's pretty, fast, reliable and all around everything I love in a car."
"05 29, 2018",love it,"Runs nice, comfortable, lots of room and storage space. I bought it used and it is the best uses car I have purchased to date. Great car, would def recommend to another person"
"05 21, 2018",Great small SUV for the money.,"The RAV4 is s dependable small SUV with excellent intetior space. It is a very good SUV for family trips that require space for luggage, coolers and sports gear."
"05  6, 2018",They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!,Great ride and much sportier to drive than the larger Highlander and 4 Runner.  The interior layout is perfect!  The cargo area is probably the largest in the compact SUV class (at this time).  Too bad you can no longer get a V6 option (2012 was the last year):  That makes this great car truly outstanding!
"05  4, 2018",LOVE THIS CAR,"VERY NICE CONDITION, LIKE THE AMENITIES, DRIVES GREAT AND I HOPE IT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY IT OFF -- LOOKING FORWAARD TO DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT"
"05  3, 2018",Excellent transportation in the winter,Perfect family vehicle. Roomy. Gas mileage was as good as I?ve gotten. Long road trips were made w/ it on a monthly basis. Never had a single issue.
"05  2, 2018",Most reliable vehicle ever,"My 2012 Toyota RAV4 has been a great friend to me. It has helped tremendously in every winter storm for the last three years. Cheap on gas, extremely reliable, this is definitely an excellent vehicle!!"
"04 13, 2018",Fun drive,A very fun drive and a lot of space. We used it for moving stuff all the time. Great drive for snow days. Great value and gas mileage.
"04 11, 2018",Excellent Vehicle,"Powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride. Very reliable. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I do not expect to ever sell it."
"03  3, 2018",I so in love with this car very reliable,Omg fits my needs love the space something different it's fits me.and all love the storage space as well best vehicle every the kids love it great price.
"02 24, 2018",Great Reliability and Practicality,"Very reliable
Cheap to maintain
Holds value very good as for a used car
I recommend to buy 4cylinder with all wheel drive, most popular model and will always have demend"
"02 20, 2018","Why do my lights keep comeing on,4x4, traction con","The rav4 comes up with a code o2 sensor, bank 1 sensor 2. You change it then comes rite back on along with 4?4  light and traction control  light. So you change it again. 17 miles latter they are back on .  Why. Alot of people are having same problem"
"02  7, 2018",One of the best Vehicle that I owned,I owned and driven 100s of cars in my lifetime. I worked at many car rental companies for 20 years. This vehicle will always my top recommendation to everyone
"02  3, 2018",Great looking and fun to drive car!,"I am a big Toyota fan with this 2012 RAV4 being the 7th Toyota I have owned.  They have all been very reliable, fun to drive, and go forever.   This is the first time I have owned a RAV4 though but so far so good as it seems to represent the Toyota brand like all others.  It is comfortable with the basic options, powerful enough with the 4-cylinder engine, and feels very safe driving.   Great car!"
"01 29, 2018",very stable free way driving,itsan amazing Small SUV.  lots of room for cargo. fun to drive. very good on gasoline. small enough to fit a any space like regular car.
"01 23, 2018",great Car!,"I got this car in 2015. I got it used with 18k miles on it.  I use it as my daily driver  and it's perfect  for San franciscos pothole filled streets. Though it's only a 2wheel drive, I have taken her camping to Yosemite, death valley, Zion, grand staircase escalante, Bruce canyon, Vegas, l.a., tahoe. it's great for camping for 2 people as you can fit lots of stuff in the back with the seats down. you can travel with 2 people in the back on long drives but the back seats need much better cushioning. 3 in the back is fine but might be uncomfortable for long drives. your passengers must really like each other. back seats recline. I also used my rav for moving and hauling Ikea items. the 176hp is sufficient enough for me. it has good pick up. the one I have is the standard 2wd. I think I would opt for 4wd next time just because I like to travel to more places."
"01 18, 2018","Rav 4, the car to have in the winter","An excellent vehicle for us.  It is a V6 so it has plenty of hustle in traffic and the  mpg's we get is very satisfactory at 25 on trips and 23 -24 around town.  An excellent vehicle for winter driving as well.   I would recommend a Rav, but only if the V6 was brought back.  Too bad it is no longer available in newer models."
"01 12, 2018",Best car I've ever owned!,"I love this vehicle! Well-made, safe, solid, fuel-efficient, comfortable, with lots of smart and convenient design features. Bought used from Toyota on the Park -- what a great deal and great dealership!"
"01  8, 2018",Toyota Rav4 Limited Excellent style and performanc,This SUV is comfortable with excellent head and leg room. Comfortable for Highway Travel long distances. Heated seats for winter. Driver and passenger visibility is outstanding. Dual comfort climate control makes it nice in summer and winter. Dependable with good gas mileage for full passengers and cargo ride.
"11 17, 2017",One of the greatest crossovers to ever exist!,"I own the basic 4WD V6 RAV4 2012 Model, yes the last V6 Model every made by Toyota. This car made it through a 36 hour drive to Georgia and back with no problems! The vehicle performance is similar to a Camry Sport feel, and the acceleration is powerful! It feels like I'm sitting in a  race car when I hop behind the wheel of my RAV4. If you are able to find one, get one. The 2013 and up models do not compare to this beast."
"11  7, 2017","Five years, 80.000 miles",One minor repair in all this time.  29.5mpg overall. Love the driving position and the handling of the vehicle.
"11  5, 2017",Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned,I love the reliability of my RAV4 and how it performs. I have owned or leased many cars.. Best brand
"11  3, 2017",Best Car Ever,"I love this car so much. It is comfortable and reliable, with tons of trunk space and good visibility."
"10 27, 2017",Fantastic SUV,"I love my Rav4. There's a lot more room than you would think. It comfortably fits 5, with lots of trunk space. I can't wait to test the 4WD this winter!"
"10 14, 2017","Overall OK, but need input.","I have a 2012 Rav4, (5 years old) Overall the car has been a good investment.  I have had a problem with the service lights on the dash, (Service Engine, 4-WD, and Track Off) remaining on. I had the O2 sensor replaced as the code read indicated was the problem. A few miles down the road  after the repair, the lights came on again, and the O2 sensor was again listed as the problem.  There are many people on-line with the same problem, (some have paid thousands of dollars trying to find the cause).  Toyota told me it was my car and that I should continue spending money to find out the problem.  Anyone else with this vehicle that might have suggestions?  I'm pretty frustrated with Toyota right now and wanted to share this concern to other owners who might have the same issues.  Other than that, the car works fine."
"10  9, 2017",Another Excellent Toyota Car,"I've owned my RAV4 since 2012 and I love it. I never had any problems with it since. I trust the brand name Toyota for its excellent commitment to their customers. I am not a car enthusiast but i know that if you want a vehicle for keeps, get a Toyota."
"10  6, 2017",great replacement for crv...,"hoping for best here....bought to replace older Honda crv--this has last year of v6 engine with heavy tow  package, so i can tow more than the Honda 1600 # limit.....although  rides stiffer due to run-flat tires and sport suspension tuning.....but everything else is what i wanted."
"10  2, 2017",Great SUV,"Love the 2012 RAV4 Limited with 4WD, 25 mpg, heated seats, remote start, backup camera, Bluetooth, and more. Mine has had bullet proof reliability and low maintenance costs. I wish the driver's seat was more comfortable and the interior design was upgraded. It has a huge amount of cargo room and I like the side opening tail gate."
"09 19, 2017",Great Reliable Car for the money,"Good car, rides well, good in snow -  a good safe car.  It was rated well for safety.  It is not a fast car, however drives well."
"09 15, 2017",Very happy Rav4 owner,"I havent had my Rav4 long, but i absolutely love it.  It seems very versatile and adequate for darn near anything.  I've been surprised by the power it has despite being a four cyclinder yet stays very efficient as well.  I like the interior design but do wish for a little more leg room for the backseat.  I prefer the boxier maybe jeepier look of the 2012 and older but i have heard friends with this era model complain about the rear door being too heavy with the spare tire, and that they have trouble closing while parked on a hill and that the hinges are insufficient.  I bought mine used and while the door seems fine it does rattle a bit upon closing.  I needed a family vehicle and efficient commuter car with awd and this hits all the boxes and then some.  All with Toyota's legendary reliability.  Im a person who wants to be in love with his vehicle and keep it til it dies and i imagine im gonna have this Rav4 for a long time!"
"09  5, 2017",Reliability is what I look for in a car,This car is nice looking car that is reliability. I found this car drives well on winter snow and ice. There is space to hold 5 adults and luggage for travel. I recommend this car. In fact I own two Rav4 cars.
"09  1, 2017",Overall great vehicle!,"We needed a vehicle larger than a car, but smaller than an SUV and this is the perfect size. Reliable, comfortable & plenty of truck space for traveling."
"08 19, 2017",Realiable as always in a Toyota,"Great riding vehicle and it handles excellent... also good vehicle for the price ...it's a sporty, SUV and it's the best as far as reliability.."
"08 18, 2017",This car met all my needs.,Very close to my former Lexus RX330 I used to own. Very spacious and great driving for bad weather condition.
"08  9, 2017",Great vehicle - very reliable,"I have really enjoyed owning my 2012 RAV4 Sport V6 - easy to drive, easy to park, handles like a sports car, great in the mountains and the snow. It is big enough for a small family of 4, has enough cargo room for normal jobs, and with the V6 and trailer hitch can tow my small utility trailer or 1500lb boat with ease. I'm just sad they don't make this vehicle / engine combo any longer - don't know what I will replace it with when it is time."
"07 22, 2017",Rad RAV4,"I LOVE being a RAV4 driver. This car is my pride and joy. Reliable and very attractive. 
I have the limited model, so the vehicle has leather/heated seats, a moon/sunroof, backup camera, and all the bells and whistles. It is absolutely my dream car. Toyota's are great cars and this is no exception. However, I do not care much for the body style of the RAV4's after 2012, so anything 2013+ does not interest me much. 

A used RAV will serve you well! The gas mileage is good for an SUV/crossover. Spacious on the inside with LOTS of trunk room. 

Love this car!"
"07  1, 2017",Beautiful car,"Driving this car, I knew right away that tho car was for me. Perfect size for my family of 5.  Beautiful inside and out, lots of technology."
"07  1, 2017",Great car,"Wonderful car, has a ton of room for my family of 5. Comfortable, and was built well and very reliable."
"06 26, 2017",Love the V6 engine!!,"I love having the extra power of the V6 because I drive in the mountains often. I wish I had a sunroof and feel like the space in the front seats could be designed better. Like having more compartments for phone, purse, etc would be nice. I love how the seats lay down flat in the back and I can sleep back there when I'm camping. Also love the extra storage compartment in the back where the spare tire would normally be."
"06 18, 2017",not my favorite car that i have owned,it meets my needs i dont have any problems with it but it is not very comfortable and it is not the best looking car in the world
"06 12, 2017",One of the safest cars by consumer reports!,"Awesome! I feel that it is one of the safest vehicles for my family to ride in. I love it, and it is very reliable, sporty, fun vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Easy to drive,The Rav4 is easy to drive and handles well. The turning radius is the smallest I have ever experienced.  The wheel lock button should be useful for getting out of snow or ice or mud. The interior has lots of space when the seats fold down. Highly recommended.
"05 23, 2017",IT IS OKAY IF YOU ARE BYE YOURSELF,"OKAY. at the time i needed something to go back and forth to GA it serve it purposed for what I need it for. If you are a big person it is not a good truck to have to small for anyone over 5 ft.
other wise it is a good truck. good on gas."
"05 23, 2017","Toyota Rav4, sensible and reliable","Bought my 2012 Rav4 new in 2012. 46k miles later, no repairs other than brakes and tires. Reliable , comfortable, love my heated seats.  Wish the engine and road noise weren't so loud."
"05 12, 2017",Very Reliable,Its good its got good mileage it got a good doors. its got good wheels. all four wheels work really well. everythings pretty good the seats are very comfortable
"04 24, 2017",Great Toyota product,I love my Rav4 and plan to be buying a new one in the next year or so very likely!  Toyota has been the most reliable trouble free vehicles I have ever owned and would not think of switching brands!
"04 10, 2017",Reliable & Versatile,It's been very reliable and versatile. Great for getting to work and for transporting larger items. It's easy to drive and has good gas mileage.
"03 21, 2017",Best car yet.,"Purchased my Rav4 through Prestige Toyota of Kingston. Joseph Rodelli has the patience of a saint! Took me a while to make up my mind, but I'm definitely pleased with my purchase."
"03 10, 2017",2012 Toyota RAV4,"The Toyota RAV4 is a great car. It's reliable, safe, spacious, sleek, and has all the basic features you would want your car to have. I've never had an issue with my car, I trust it completely. The seats aren't as comfortable as some other cars, but that's not too big of a deal to me. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a safe, gas efficient car."
"03  9, 2017",We love our used RAV4!,"It's beautiful, comfortable, well-designed, efficient, a dream to drive, and it was such a great deal from Toyota On The Park in Toronto. Great dealership and repair place. We are 100% happy. Love it!"
"05 28, 2016",Nice small car,You don't need the v 6.  3 row seat is a waist of money.Not comfortable to drive if over six foot.Weak a.c.. Nice car and runs good but get a loaded limited..
"06 10, 2015",Rav4,"Love my new Rav4. I've only had it a week, but I can tell you, I feel safe in it and secure with my decision in purchasing one. Toyota's are dependable, safe and they hold their value for years to come. I would recommend one to anybody. Great car!"
"03 11, 2014",The most valuable small SUV,"I purchased 2012 Sport V4 model to replace 2005 Sienna Van. I rented a Hyundi Santa Fe for roadtrip before my purchsing. I also tested Nissan Rouge and Honda CRV. Rav4 and Honda CRV were on the final run. I choice Toyota because the package met my need for the price that I expected.

Less than one year later, my wife purchased the 2013 CRV base model.

Now, I can tell you the true experience of these two competitors as the user.

They both have same performance.

Rav4 2012 is the last year of the old model. Its interior was designed for V6 w/7 seat optiopn. The 2nd row seat can be slided back and forth. My 5 seat get extra leg room when I push back. Because mine is 5 seat model. It has X-extra huge cargo space. Put down the 2nd row seat, I can still get a flat space like a bed when I going out for camping like driving Sienna van. The 6 speakers audio has excellent sound quality. The only Con's for this car from my experience are 2:
1. The doors are very light, so most of times I have push a little when closing the door.
2. The gas tank is only 12 gal. I believe this is a compromise for the other X-extra features for 7 seat option. I believe this has been changed to 16 gal. in 2013 new model. Of cause, you will not get those X-extra space from 2013 model.
My Sport model come with roof window, rack, buletooth and MP3, USB and back-up camera.
I used to buy long lumbers from HomeDepot when I drove Sienna van. Although Rav4 is not as long as Sienna van , I can still buy plenty of 2x6x(8+ size). My Rav4 Sport model has #3 gear which help picking up speed on highway when I need.

Honda has better interior (roomy). The windshield was pushed forward with wider glass to get more space. The interior width is also a little wider than Rav4. The driver's seat has arm rest which is good for long trip. The back-up camera(rear monitor) has become standard feature which is very thoughtful for high position vehicle. The cargo space is huge too. CRV has smaller turning radious for you make U-turn.

They both make you feel very steady while driving on the curving road. They both very reliable, comfort, good driver's view to all around the traffic. The price is difficult to compare each other. I will think they are pretty much the same if same features, but unfortuantely their different trims equipted with different features.

Toyota Rav4 (even though 2013 model) is a little sporty looking while CRV is more like city car. You shall pick what you need. You will like either one. Both Toyota and Honda make good value products.

So far, I have 10500 miles on my Rav4 and over 5000 miles on CRV.

My Rav4 perform 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the roadtrip with premium gas.

My wife has never counted the mpg for her CRV. I think it is about the same in city. I guess the roadtrip mpg shall be a little better if we try Eco-mode. She mentioned one time about Eco-mode and said ""You don't want use this feature in the town even though on highway because the system will run with less power."" I guess that Eco-mode will be very helpful if we go for roadtrip in Wild West.

Hope these true experience are helpful for you."
"01 24, 2014",Great buy,"We really like this car! Got it because we're expecting a baby and wNt something reliable and functional. We got it from Maguire Toyota in Ithaca, NY, and Bridget helped us. She was fantastic- never pressured us, just showed us everything we wanted to see, gave us more information, and answered all our questions. We'll be going back there for our next vehicle purchase,"
"11 25, 2013","Like the car, but. . .","RAV is a good choice, generally. Can't beat it for dependability, resale, etc. Not very exciting in the interior, although it's OK. I like the external spare, but that's going away, along with leather seat covers and V6 power. Uses tons of fuel, but that's true with the smaller engine as well."
"09  8, 2013","Very good on gas milage, reliable and beautiful.","Very good on gas milage.
Nice,cozy interior and beautifully crafted exterior.
Spacious trunk for shopping and for reasonable haulage.
Easily accessible driving features and equiped with some modern car technology. Loving It."
"07 28, 2013",Loving it!,"Looks great, drives great. I bought it for the AWD feature for winter driving. I'm happy it will have the power when I need it, and has great gas mileage."
"07 22, 2013",My Dream UV I Never Knew!,"I am amazed at the comfort and security this vehicle gives me once I get behind the wheel. The difference in the gas mileage expenditure has improved from day one. I love the GPS feature and Blue tooth, which have come in so handy for me with my kids/family/co-workers! I love my Rav4! THANKS JESSE!!"
"03  7, 2013",great car!,The seller and finance personnel were all very helpful and proffessional. But best of all i got the best deal in the market! I love my new toyota rav4!!!
"02 28, 2013",AWESOME!,"We just love this vehicle! Within 15 minutes of purchasing I was traveling 300 miles. It rode smoothly, I feel safe in it, comfy...simple WE LOVE IT!"
"02 23, 2013",like the v6 power. Goooooo,"I have a 2007 Rav4 and use it for travel. The V6 give you the option of getting out of the way or hitting the brakes. the interstates are test of survival. So when I found out that toyota was getting rid of the V6 safety feature, I purchased the 2012 with the V6. Now the 2013 Rav4 looks like all the rest. Oh hum"
"01 29, 2013",Mitsubishi,"Happy with car after purchase. There is nothing more to say than, what a nice car. It was the cae that caught my eye on the road"
"01 24, 2013",Found a great car at a great price,"Haven't had it long enough to really tell yet, but so far, I am more than satisfied. The ride is a little stiff. The gas mileage has been better than expected."
"01 22, 2013",Great Solid Driver,"Drove them all found the Rav 4 to be the most solid feeling Cross over in it's class. Nice feel on the hi-way, great brakes, comfortable firm but not harsh ride."
"01 17, 2013",Bought Toyotas since 1976,"We've bought Toyotas since we were married in 1976. We have found them to be very realiable. We're had corolla, camrays, Supra, Thundra, other trucks, and this is my second Rav 4"
"01 15, 2013",Outstanding buying expierence!,"As a long term West Herr customer, I recently referred a friend to ""Casey Mac Alpine"" at West Herr Toyota of Williamsville. Just wanted to express the great customer service that my friend received from ""Casey""which was ""Class A all the way. She mentioned that this was the best car buying experience that she has ever had in the many years of dealing with sales people. She felt that the he listened and cared!"
"01 14, 2013",Fun little in-town car,"Fun to drive, Not a luxury car, nice little commuter that holds a lot. Great on gas. I use the Rav4 to get to and from work about 5 miles each way. I also have horses and need to hall feed from time to time and this little SUV does it all. Recently put 10 bags of shavings in it with no trouble at all. I needed a car with good gas mileage and could hall feed, and large dogs. This Rav4 seems to do it all with ease. So far I love it. Don't think i would like it on a long trip."
"01  9, 2013",best suv,looks great feels good great ride. Has many extra's and toyota is big on all the small details and extras
"01  6, 2013",Worst experience,"First off, my family has always owned a Toyota and NEVER ever had problems. We were always satisfied by how reliable the quality of Toyota vehicles were.

With an almost 1 yr old and me being pregnant, my husband and I decided we needed to buy a brand new car. He wanted a Ford or Jeep, but I insisted on Toyota. I did so much research and showed him all the great consumer and expert reviews on the Rav4. He finally caved in and we bought a brand new 2012 Rav4.

We got it in August 2012 and loved it! But then 3 months later (1,200 mileage only) in November (we live in the UK by the way, stationed in England), it broke down on me and my daughter at night in the cold. We were stuck for 1.5hr trying to get help and then finally a friend was able to get us but he tried to drive it too, and it broke down on him too. I know my prego hormones were out of wack, but it was awful and my daughter was crying hysterically by the way. We were cold and scared!

My husband tried to drive it to the Cambridge Toyota center but it broke down on him too and he had to wait 4hrs and 40 mins for someone to tow it to the dealership.

Then it took almost 2 weeks to figure out what was wrong with it. My husband who was deploying the following week at first was asking friends for rides to his deployment appointments and briefings, but since it was taking longer than expected we had to rent a car (which is not covered by warranty). It was just the worst timing ever.

The fuel pump pressure was defective. Warranty covered it and is ""fixed"" they say, but apparently it is still causing problems because our neighbors who are currently watching the car for us (they'll be watching it for about 6 months) says it still runs when they drive it, but it feels like it might stall at stops. It hasn't stalled yet, but STILL, what safety is that?!

Sorry Toyota, this experience totally made me never want to own one, and not only do I feel betrayed by Toyota's reliable past, I also feel like I disrespected my husband by not considering the Ford or Jeep he wanted. Should have just listened to him and trusted him!

Totally disappointed and not looking forward to going back to the UK to drive a potentially hazardous car for our family."
"12 20, 2012",G-Man,"This is the third Rav4 I've owned. They never disappoint. Excellent performance, comfort, and very
reliable. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space, comes in
handy, on many occasions. Living in New England, the
Rav4, enables you to drive in any condition, with confidence. I've had a direct influence on six friends,
who also purchased Rav4's."
"12 19, 2012",RECOMMEND TO ALL,"CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, RECOMMEND TO ALL.PERFECT SO EASY TO DRIVE, WARRENTY IS GREAT, MAINTANCE IS EXCELLENT."
"12 10, 2012",Excellent!,"Best car I've ever owned ... I traded a 2009 RAV4 for my 2012! Great mileage, comfort, style, perfect for toting my amps and guitars to gigs. Love it!"
"10 31, 2012",RAV,"This is the fourth Toyota in our household and my second RAV4. My first RAV4 was 12yrs old, and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was to get the down payment to buy a newer one. I got a great price when I sold my 2001 RAV4 - had I been able to keep the old one and still buy the new one, I would have b/c I LOVE my RAVs!"
"10 26, 2012",Excellent little car,Care has plenty of pep and get-up-and-go for a 4-cylinder engine. The handling is superb. Very pleased with leg room. Good dependable care for the money. Would recommend to a friend
"10 22, 2012",The RAV4 Sport,"Fabulous vehicle, way more room than the Honda CR-V! Strongly influenced by owning a 2003 Matrix for 8 years! Durable, long lasting, and reliable! Never doubted the vehicle for a second! I am very happy about my Dad's advice and gearing me towards a RAV4 Sport! Absolutely outstanding. My husband jokingly and lovingly says; ""All you ever do is have a nicer car than your husband!""

Love it!"
"10 17, 2012",Very comfortable,"I'm 6'4"" with arthritis in knees and hips. The RAV4 allows me to travel for more than 1 1/2 hrs before I need to stop to relieve knee and hip pain. There is also more than ample headroom."
"09 28, 2012",Need more seat time to be totally objective,"Great mid size SUV.
Good Fuel economy.
Great Ride with good cornering stability.
Toyo Open country tires noisy on some furfaces."
"09 23, 2012",Safe and Reliable Small SUV,"This is the second RAV4 we have owned. It is a nice little SUV for our needs, we purchased for reliability and the value we got for the money. Very easy to drive and has all the safety features you need in a modern vehicle including the backup camera. Plenty of room in the back for all our stuff and a Kayak on top of the racks. Plus my wife likes how the higher stance of the vehicle gives her a better view of the road. The RAV4 fits our lifestyle and needs."
"09 21, 2012",32 mpg on hwy,"minimum 28 mpg through yellowstone, tetons,rockies. almost drives itself.only a four cylinder but plenty power."
"09 10, 2012",Just another car,"It is an okay car, if my Honda was not totaled I would not have bought this. According to the on car mpg gauge we are only getting 21 mpg."
"08 24, 2012",Rav4 Review,"Stylish , Innovative, Contemporary Toyota Moving Forward! Vast Improvement over last years mOdel, no recalls yet?"
"08 24, 2012",My New Rav 4,"I've been a Toyota person forever. Prior to this SUV, I had a Yaris - which is fantastic on gas. I needed a vehicle for the snow, plus a larger one for my dogs. I absolutely love my SUV, roomy enough, and it sits high enough (like a truck) so I can see past the vehicle ahead of me. It rides so smootlhly and I can't wait to use all the gadgets I've never had before in a car. For a larger vehicle that I am used to - it is doing exceptionally well on gas. (I average 26.5 mpg) This is in the city - mind you. This is also the first vehicle I've had which is automatic. I have to remind myself not to shift & not to clutch. Other than this, I love my new Rav-ioli."
"08 23, 2012",Better than govt. motors,Got tired of poor quality of gm dealers. Tired of their shoddy service and excuses. Bought Toyota. Best personal service of dealers and sales. Most courteous and genuine. WONT GO BACK TO GM.
"08 23, 2012",Raving over the Rav 4,"It took me a long time to settle on and buy exactly what I wanted. The Toyota Rav 4 Sport V6. It's fun to drive, surprisingly quick and responsive, looks amazing (sport w/appearance package) and toyota's reliability is bar none. I wish that they offered navigation systems in the other models besides the limited, but I'll just have to use the maps on my smart phone. Great all round, 4 seasons car."
"08 21, 2012",love my suv,It is what I wanted and thank the dealer for making it possible. Love the way it drives and the way it looks.
"08 14, 2012",RAV4 SPORT RED,"I bought RAV4 Sport, ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy... if you driving by yourself, I guess it?s O.K.. it?s not good for family ride. First couple of years I use to get good gas mileage, then it?s drop to around 17-19 miles? I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. If I wait till 5K there won't be any oil to change, it burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 3 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's normal. What I am hearing and reading almost all the TOYOTA cars are BURNING OIL like crazy. Now I just add oil every other month, seems like I made a big mistake buying the RAV4,, after 4-recall I think I am done with TOYOTA!!"
"07 12, 2012",Must have,I love this car and the stylish new look. I have the sport and it's a beautiful SUV. Must have........
"06 29, 2012",now a two rav4 family,the 97 rav 4 is sweet with no problems other than normal service which is expected so we added a new one to the family which is the 2012 rav4 limited and passed on the 4 wheel drive and 6 cylinder as we live in Florida and wanted the best millage and did not have the need for a 6 or 4x4 as our new 2012 rav has more power than the 97 which is fine everywhere fully loaded with camp equipment except for going up mountains where I could not even meet the 55 mph speed limit so expect the new rav to hanndle that even better
"05  6, 2012",2nd Toyota SUV - after Chevys and Benzs...,"Since last few weeks I am enjoying my new 2012 Toyota RAV4 Sport 4WD, it is really a nice vehicle.
Bluetooth works great, Fuel wise is also very echonomical, drive smooth."
"04 19, 2012",2nd RAV 4 I've Owned,"This is the 2nd RAV 4 I've Owned. Traded in a 2002 Model RAV 4 for the 2012 Model. It's quite different and I still love it. It's larger, roomier and still great to handle. I especially like the roomier back seat and the larger cargo area. Looked at some competitor's vehicles but came back to the RAV 4 mostly for the reliability and great value."
"04 16, 2012",My Rav,"This is the best car i ever own, I always wanted it. If I didnt get it I woudnt feel right. When you really want something you have to go for it!!"
"04 12, 2012",Love it so far,"I just got my 2012 Rav4 a few weeks ago and took it on a 14 hours round trip to Virginia with no problems. I averaged 25mpg- not awesome but I'll take it. It was very car-like and easy to handle and also very comfortable. Visibility was fine. You do have to watch for wind - common with taller cars but I was driving a tiny sedan previously so it was not something I was used to right away. I love the bluetooth capability and the controls on the dash - something I did not really think I would care about. Since I went from CNY (40 degrees) to Va (65 degrees) I got to use both heat and a/c: both were fine. Lots of storage space throughout. My friend just traded in her 12 year old Rav 4 with over 140,000mi on it. I hope mine lasts that long!"
"11  9, 2023",Insufficient time line for Blizzard Pearl recall.,"The exterior received 1 star as the Blizzard Pearl paint looked great before its now ongoing pealing frenzy. 
The 2012 RAV4 is great in every aspect for its generation though the Blizzard Pearl isn’t holding up. 
The Blizzard Pearl paint, as good looking as it is, or paint prep is failing in a big way. The roof was pealing above the windshield aprox. 4 years ago, its repainting was cover per the extended warranty. Now 1 year after the warranty expired the hood, drivers side front post, drivers side passenger door and the rear hatch are all pealing. Blizzard Pearl! It’s now a looker going down the road for a different reason."
"07  6, 2023",To many problems in this Suv,This SUV HAS A SO MUCH PROBLEM I HAVE 2012 RAV4 51000 MILES IN MY SUV BURN OIL WHEEL SENIOR NO GOOD AIR BEG PROBLEM SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND FEW MORE PROBLEM WITH 2012 TOYOTA RAV4
"04 14, 2023",2012 Rav 4 is a gem.,I had a 2012 Rav 4 and a man ran a red light and ran over me and the Rav had to be junked. I got my second 2012 Rav 4 and both were and are wonderful cars. Would highly reccommend.
"01 27, 2023","RAV4 Sport v6, no better price for a 4WD","I had researched small/compact SUV vehicles in their respective class. Toyota known for reliability and quality for the price was on top of my list.
It took me a years time to have gotten lucky enough on a trade in at a local dealer. My timing was right on as when I arrived l looked it over before speaking with a rep. I overheard employees saying that the RAV4 Sport v6 check all the boxes and was a unicorn in and out. The owner must have taken a hit which after test driving it, it was straight as an arrow with minor slight blemishes for a 8 year old vehicle. I knew to make an offer, which was listed at $15,500. It was the end of the month, so it was approved to sell at $1000. Off if I took it that day. “Deal” and ever since driving it away with my temporary papers, I knew I found the SUV 4WD I’ve been looking for.
Right place, right time. I still have it and it’s a workhorse, and have put about 15k on it to which It had 60k when I purchased it.
Great buy, and say goodbye to v6 engines as the car companies need to go green and the future is about EV."
"04  5, 2021",Love love love it!,Everything mechanically was checked out and fixed by the dealer before driving off the lot. I love the low miles and great deal I got.
"03 31, 2021",This car is like my old one with way less miles.,It’s like brand new. It’s 4 years newer than my old car that has 260k miles. This has 65k miles. That’s why I bought another one. Love the v6 Rav 4. Hope they make it again.
"02  2, 2021",Best reliable suv I've ever owned,"This SUV didn't only meet my expectations,  it's far surpassed them.  Good on gas,  nice smooth ride,  and has not given me one problem.  2010-2012 is the best year,  that's my opinion."
"01 23, 2021",My favorite vehicle I’ve owned,It is perfect for what I need in a vehicle. Plenty of space to haul whatever I need. I like the styling and the overall design.
"01  3, 2021",Extremely reliable and spacious,"This car was very reliable and spacious. Not much for luxury, but it was a fantastic value, had plenty of space, and was good on gas."
"08 11, 2020",I Love My RAV4!,"I bought my RAV4 in 2015. It was 3 years old with 23,000 miles on it. Five years later I have 117,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier. I take care of normal maintenance and haven't had any unexpected repairs at all. Reliability is of utmost importance to me and its been flawless. I love the interior space and how it sits up high. Its fun to drive and great looking, too. This 2012 RAV4 has been exceptionally good for me."
"08  6, 2020",Very clean car for the money spent!,So far the car is running just fine it had low miles and is in very good shape. It’s hard to find a car this year that doesn’t have a lot of miles!!
"06 22, 2020",Amazing Safety Even Without Fancy Features,"I owned the 2012 RAV-4 from 2015-2020, bought it used. Never had any major maintenance issues even at 70k miles. The only reason I no longer own it is because of an accident; I hydroplaned on the highway, skidded across four lanes of traffic, and slammed into a guardrail—the car was sadly totalled, but there wasn't a single scratch on me. The safety and reliability of this car is unmatched for its class."
"01 27, 2020",This the best value for money car in any segment,"I got the 7 seater 4 cyl with dealer modified Sunroof etc. I fitted a android navigation unit to replace the original CD unit. 
This car never failed in snow, desert, highways or city. I drove it for 65K miles in NJ, CA & GA and it always did the job with very little maintenance like Battery, tires and Brakes. Get tires from tire shop and not from dealer as they sell very bad tires.
It is under powered compared to a V6 only on gradient roads. It can still be quick on the highways."
"01 27, 2020",one of the best cars i ever owned.,"i drove this car for the past five years and no problem ever. It is an 
excellent drive and very low maintenance and fantastic gas millage."
"12 31, 2019",Best affordable car ever!,"Not luxurious, but ROOMY, COMFORTABLE, & RELIABLE. No issues ever!  Perfect seat-height for us seniors. Easy getting in/out. Great, tight turning-radius.  Would definitely buy again."
"12 31, 2019",Love Toyota RAV4 this is my second,I’ve been spoiled for other cars by the RAV4. My last one had over 195k miles. I’m looking for even better longevity with this one.
"12  8, 2019",Very nice comfortable car!,This car has plenty space and not too big. The seats are comfortable. The car is smooth to drive. I liked that car very much.
"11 30, 2019",I heard fantastic things about this vehicle,"Everything I was looking for.  I was looking for something that sat higher, a vehicle with storage space and would do great in all weather conditions."
"11 12, 2019",Tank of a car,"Two weeks and one day after I bought this car I was rear-ended by a Ford focus hatchback.

The girl texting and driving had to have her vehicle towed from the scene, and the spare tire on mine took most of the damage. She still did about $3,000 worth of damage, but I was able to drive away.

The car can use a better sound system, and the seats are okay - but it's a tank in the snow, and so far has been great."
"09  2, 2019",Disappointed ☹️,"The brakes make a clicking noise. The paint is coming off in sheets on the passenger side, and the windshield wipers are almost inoperable. I’ve taken the car in twice and nothing happened. The dealership does not  respond to my questions nor does the manufacturer."
"08 27, 2019",So far it's very nice,"We've only owned it for a little over a week but so far it's been a good vehicle. From experience I know that Toyota makes some very good cars and trucks, that's why we went with this."
"07 18, 2019",Great vehicle for light 4x4,"I've owned this car for almost 4 years now. It has been rock solid from day one, and has never shown any problems. It is just big enough to fit 2 adults and 3 kids (2 in boosters, 1 in car-seat). It has been great for long trips, and gets decent gas mileage.

My biggest complaint about the car was that the cargo door opens up the wrong way. When I park on the right side of the street, the door opens out to the right. So now I can't just unload right onto the curb, I have to carry thing around the door."
"07  7, 2019",Best in Total cost of ownership,"Dealers were nice during maintenance. Yes they were pushy, but I was careful. Don't use stick tires or battery. Costco has better options. Driver seat is not comfortable for a 6 foot folks. I have a seven seater that was used when there are guests."
"06 25, 2019",My last 5 cars have been Toyotas.,Great on back roads.  Toyotas run forever. The only problem is that the last owner was a heavy smoker.  My dealer was great —- I would buy from him again.
"06  5, 2019",Love Love this !!!,"Love the look of the Rav4,  and how much room there is in the back. Can't wait to be riding the roads and showing it off!"
"05  1, 2019","Bought in Blue Springs MO and drove it to LA, CA","This RAV 4 performed really well on a long trip to LA the day after I bought it used. It handled the cold, the desert and the mountains effortlessly.  I would highly recommend buying a used vehicle from Universal Auto Plaza Blue Springs, MO."
"03 22, 2019",Works for my fam!,It’s a great car for nuclear family. I’d recommend it for folks who’d want to go on road trips and have stuff to carry on.
"01 20, 2019",It is the most reliable car.,Yes this car did meet my needs as has always been and I will recommend a friend ant time to buy or service their car .
"10 26, 2018",I love the style size the great pickup from the v,This suv is great meets all my needs that?s why I selected this vehicle plus low maintenance dependable performance reliable handles very well great pickup too
"08 15, 2018",Love this car!,After I broke my hip I had to trade my Fit for a higher sitting car. Thought about a crv but decided on the Rav instead & never regretted my decision.
"07 27, 2018",RAV4 are the best cars we've ever owned!,"Great size, V6 has crazy amazing power, 3 rows of seats in an SUV this size is outstanding. Reliability is top notch and service is a breeze.  Best family car ever with great features for the value.  Our favorite care to date and we've had 3!!!"
"07 26, 2018",I feel safe driving it in really any conditions.,"This car has been great for me!  I needed something that would drive well in the snow, and it has done that and more.  It technically can fit 7 (which is really nice at times) but the back 2 seats have very little legroom, so stick your short friends back there."
"07  3, 2018",Been a great vehicle.,Has met all of my needs. Upkept very well. Never been in the shop except for routine maintenance issues. Only selling because I want to buy a newer model.
"06 21, 2018","great, comfortable car.","I bought this car new and have all of the service records and manuals.  It is a great ride, good visibility, comfortable and reliable. It is a high end model with leather interior and weather tech floor mats. Blue tooth phone connection."
"06 19, 2018",Third RAV4 and looking forward to the next...,I absolutely love my RAV4 - as mentioned this is my third one.  All three of my RAVs were V6 engine - won't buy the 4 cylinder.  The RAV has the largest cargo space of any vehicle in it's class.  Loads of room!  I can't wait for the 2019 - new EVERYTHING - remodeled with technology in mind.  Seriously - you cannot go wrong with a used RAV.  Love my car!
"06 15, 2018",good car for hauling,this has been a very good car for big loads. The only problem is there is not enough leg room for the mean in our family
"06 13, 2018",Excellent car all around!,This is a great car. Never given me any problems. I can haul a ton of stuff. Very comfortable and roomy. I would buy this car again.
"06  6, 2018",Fantastic auto,"We bought our 2012 rav4 sport v6 and new off the lot in 2012.  Been a super vehicle.  Don't listen to others get the v6.  It is far better then the 4 and actually gets better gas mileage.  It has 70,000 miles on it now with absolutely no problems.  I would definitely buy it again."
"06  5, 2018",My Favorite Car!,"I've owned a lot of cars, got to be at least 15, in my life. This one is by far my favorite! It's pretty, fast, reliable and all around everything I love in a car."
"05 29, 2018",love it,"Runs nice, comfortable, lots of room and storage space. I bought it used and it is the best uses car I have purchased to date. Great car, would def recommend to another person"
"05 21, 2018",Great small SUV for the money.,"The RAV4 is s dependable small SUV with excellent intetior space. It is a very good SUV for family trips that require space for luggage, coolers and sports gear."
"05  6, 2018",They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!,Great ride and much sportier to drive than the larger Highlander and 4 Runner.  The interior layout is perfect!  The cargo area is probably the largest in the compact SUV class (at this time).  Too bad you can no longer get a V6 option (2012 was the last year):  That makes this great car truly outstanding!
"05  4, 2018",LOVE THIS CAR,"VERY NICE CONDITION, LIKE THE AMENITIES, DRIVES GREAT AND I HOPE IT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY IT OFF -- LOOKING FORWAARD TO DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT"
"05  3, 2018",Excellent transportation in the winter,Perfect family vehicle. Roomy. Gas mileage was as good as I?ve gotten. Long road trips were made w/ it on a monthly basis. Never had a single issue.
"05  2, 2018",Most reliable vehicle ever,"My 2012 Toyota RAV4 has been a great friend to me. It has helped tremendously in every winter storm for the last three years. Cheap on gas, extremely reliable, this is definitely an excellent vehicle!!"
"04 13, 2018",Fun drive,A very fun drive and a lot of space. We used it for moving stuff all the time. Great drive for snow days. Great value and gas mileage.
"04 11, 2018",Excellent Vehicle,"Powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride. Very reliable. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I do not expect to ever sell it."
"03  3, 2018",I so in love with this car very reliable,Omg fits my needs love the space something different it's fits me.and all love the storage space as well best vehicle every the kids love it great price.
"02 24, 2018",Great Reliability and Practicality,"Very reliable
Cheap to maintain
Holds value very good as for a used car
I recommend to buy 4cylinder with all wheel drive, most popular model and will always have demend"
"02 20, 2018","Why do my lights keep comeing on,4x4, traction con","The rav4 comes up with a code o2 sensor, bank 1 sensor 2. You change it then comes rite back on along with 4?4  light and traction control  light. So you change it again. 17 miles latter they are back on .  Why. Alot of people are having same problem"
"02  7, 2018",One of the best Vehicle that I owned,I owned and driven 100s of cars in my lifetime. I worked at many car rental companies for 20 years. This vehicle will always my top recommendation to everyone
"02  3, 2018",Great looking and fun to drive car!,"I am a big Toyota fan with this 2012 RAV4 being the 7th Toyota I have owned.  They have all been very reliable, fun to drive, and go forever.   This is the first time I have owned a RAV4 though but so far so good as it seems to represent the Toyota brand like all others.  It is comfortable with the basic options, powerful enough with the 4-cylinder engine, and feels very safe driving.   Great car!"
"01 29, 2018",very stable free way driving,itsan amazing Small SUV.  lots of room for cargo. fun to drive. very good on gasoline. small enough to fit a any space like regular car.
"01 23, 2018",great Car!,"I got this car in 2015. I got it used with 18k miles on it.  I use it as my daily driver  and it's perfect  for San franciscos pothole filled streets. Though it's only a 2wheel drive, I have taken her camping to Yosemite, death valley, Zion, grand staircase escalante, Bruce canyon, Vegas, l.a., tahoe. it's great for camping for 2 people as you can fit lots of stuff in the back with the seats down. you can travel with 2 people in the back on long drives but the back seats need much better cushioning. 3 in the back is fine but might be uncomfortable for long drives. your passengers must really like each other. back seats recline. I also used my rav for moving and hauling Ikea items. the 176hp is sufficient enough for me. it has good pick up. the one I have is the standard 2wd. I think I would opt for 4wd next time just because I like to travel to more places."
"01 18, 2018","Rav 4, the car to have in the winter","An excellent vehicle for us.  It is a V6 so it has plenty of hustle in traffic and the  mpg's we get is very satisfactory at 25 on trips and 23 -24 around town.  An excellent vehicle for winter driving as well.   I would recommend a Rav, but only if the V6 was brought back.  Too bad it is no longer available in newer models."
"01 12, 2018",Best car I've ever owned!,"I love this vehicle! Well-made, safe, solid, fuel-efficient, comfortable, with lots of smart and convenient design features. Bought used from Toyota on the Park -- what a great deal and great dealership!"
"01  8, 2018",Toyota Rav4 Limited Excellent style and performanc,This SUV is comfortable with excellent head and leg room. Comfortable for Highway Travel long distances. Heated seats for winter. Driver and passenger visibility is outstanding. Dual comfort climate control makes it nice in summer and winter. Dependable with good gas mileage for full passengers and cargo ride.
"11 17, 2017",One of the greatest crossovers to ever exist!,"I own the basic 4WD V6 RAV4 2012 Model, yes the last V6 Model every made by Toyota. This car made it through a 36 hour drive to Georgia and back with no problems! The vehicle performance is similar to a Camry Sport feel, and the acceleration is powerful! It feels like I'm sitting in a  race car when I hop behind the wheel of my RAV4. If you are able to find one, get one. The 2013 and up models do not compare to this beast."
"11  7, 2017","Five years, 80.000 miles",One minor repair in all this time.  29.5mpg overall. Love the driving position and the handling of the vehicle.
"11  5, 2017",Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned,I love the reliability of my RAV4 and how it performs. I have owned or leased many cars.. Best brand
"11  3, 2017",Best Car Ever,"I love this car so much. It is comfortable and reliable, with tons of trunk space and good visibility."
"10 27, 2017",Fantastic SUV,"I love my Rav4. There's a lot more room than you would think. It comfortably fits 5, with lots of trunk space. I can't wait to test the 4WD this winter!"
"10 14, 2017","Overall OK, but need input.","I have a 2012 Rav4, (5 years old) Overall the car has been a good investment.  I have had a problem with the service lights on the dash, (Service Engine, 4-WD, and Track Off) remaining on. I had the O2 sensor replaced as the code read indicated was the problem. A few miles down the road  after the repair, the lights came on again, and the O2 sensor was again listed as the problem.  There are many people on-line with the same problem, (some have paid thousands of dollars trying to find the cause).  Toyota told me it was my car and that I should continue spending money to find out the problem.  Anyone else with this vehicle that might have suggestions?  I'm pretty frustrated with Toyota right now and wanted to share this concern to other owners who might have the same issues.  Other than that, the car works fine."
"10  9, 2017",Another Excellent Toyota Car,"I've owned my RAV4 since 2012 and I love it. I never had any problems with it since. I trust the brand name Toyota for its excellent commitment to their customers. I am not a car enthusiast but i know that if you want a vehicle for keeps, get a Toyota."
"10  6, 2017",great replacement for crv...,"hoping for best here....bought to replace older Honda crv--this has last year of v6 engine with heavy tow  package, so i can tow more than the Honda 1600 # limit.....although  rides stiffer due to run-flat tires and sport suspension tuning.....but everything else is what i wanted."
"10  2, 2017",Great SUV,"Love the 2012 RAV4 Limited with 4WD, 25 mpg, heated seats, remote start, backup camera, Bluetooth, and more. Mine has had bullet proof reliability and low maintenance costs. I wish the driver's seat was more comfortable and the interior design was upgraded. It has a huge amount of cargo room and I like the side opening tail gate."
"09 19, 2017",Great Reliable Car for the money,"Good car, rides well, good in snow -  a good safe car.  It was rated well for safety.  It is not a fast car, however drives well."
"09 15, 2017",Very happy Rav4 owner,"I havent had my Rav4 long, but i absolutely love it.  It seems very versatile and adequate for darn near anything.  I've been surprised by the power it has despite being a four cyclinder yet stays very efficient as well.  I like the interior design but do wish for a little more leg room for the backseat.  I prefer the boxier maybe jeepier look of the 2012 and older but i have heard friends with this era model complain about the rear door being too heavy with the spare tire, and that they have trouble closing while parked on a hill and that the hinges are insufficient.  I bought mine used and while the door seems fine it does rattle a bit upon closing.  I needed a family vehicle and efficient commuter car with awd and this hits all the boxes and then some.  All with Toyota's legendary reliability.  Im a person who wants to be in love with his vehicle and keep it til it dies and i imagine im gonna have this Rav4 for a long time!"
"09  5, 2017",Reliability is what I look for in a car,This car is nice looking car that is reliability. I found this car drives well on winter snow and ice. There is space to hold 5 adults and luggage for travel. I recommend this car. In fact I own two Rav4 cars.
"09  1, 2017",Overall great vehicle!,"We needed a vehicle larger than a car, but smaller than an SUV and this is the perfect size. Reliable, comfortable & plenty of truck space for traveling."
"08 19, 2017",Realiable as always in a Toyota,"Great riding vehicle and it handles excellent... also good vehicle for the price ...it's a sporty, SUV and it's the best as far as reliability.."
"08 18, 2017",This car met all my needs.,Very close to my former Lexus RX330 I used to own. Very spacious and great driving for bad weather condition.
"08  9, 2017",Great vehicle - very reliable,"I have really enjoyed owning my 2012 RAV4 Sport V6 - easy to drive, easy to park, handles like a sports car, great in the mountains and the snow. It is big enough for a small family of 4, has enough cargo room for normal jobs, and with the V6 and trailer hitch can tow my small utility trailer or 1500lb boat with ease. I'm just sad they don't make this vehicle / engine combo any longer - don't know what I will replace it with when it is time."
"07 22, 2017",Rad RAV4,"I LOVE being a RAV4 driver. This car is my pride and joy. Reliable and very attractive. 
I have the limited model, so the vehicle has leather/heated seats, a moon/sunroof, backup camera, and all the bells and whistles. It is absolutely my dream car. Toyota's are great cars and this is no exception. However, I do not care much for the body style of the RAV4's after 2012, so anything 2013+ does not interest me much. 

A used RAV will serve you well! The gas mileage is good for an SUV/crossover. Spacious on the inside with LOTS of trunk room. 

Love this car!"
"07  1, 2017",Beautiful car,"Driving this car, I knew right away that tho car was for me. Perfect size for my family of 5.  Beautiful inside and out, lots of technology."
"07  1, 2017",Great car,"Wonderful car, has a ton of room for my family of 5. Comfortable, and was built well and very reliable."
"06 26, 2017",Love the V6 engine!!,"I love having the extra power of the V6 because I drive in the mountains often. I wish I had a sunroof and feel like the space in the front seats could be designed better. Like having more compartments for phone, purse, etc would be nice. I love how the seats lay down flat in the back and I can sleep back there when I'm camping. Also love the extra storage compartment in the back where the spare tire would normally be."
"06 18, 2017",not my favorite car that i have owned,it meets my needs i dont have any problems with it but it is not very comfortable and it is not the best looking car in the world
"06 12, 2017",One of the safest cars by consumer reports!,"Awesome! I feel that it is one of the safest vehicles for my family to ride in. I love it, and it is very reliable, sporty, fun vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Easy to drive,The Rav4 is easy to drive and handles well. The turning radius is the smallest I have ever experienced.  The wheel lock button should be useful for getting out of snow or ice or mud. The interior has lots of space when the seats fold down. Highly recommended.
"05 23, 2017",IT IS OKAY IF YOU ARE BYE YOURSELF,"OKAY. at the time i needed something to go back and forth to GA it serve it purposed for what I need it for. If you are a big person it is not a good truck to have to small for anyone over 5 ft.
other wise it is a good truck. good on gas."
"05 23, 2017","Toyota Rav4, sensible and reliable","Bought my 2012 Rav4 new in 2012. 46k miles later, no repairs other than brakes and tires. Reliable , comfortable, love my heated seats.  Wish the engine and road noise weren't so loud."
"05 12, 2017",Very Reliable,Its good its got good mileage it got a good doors. its got good wheels. all four wheels work really well. everythings pretty good the seats are very comfortable
"04 24, 2017",Great Toyota product,I love my Rav4 and plan to be buying a new one in the next year or so very likely!  Toyota has been the most reliable trouble free vehicles I have ever owned and would not think of switching brands!
"04 10, 2017",Reliable & Versatile,It's been very reliable and versatile. Great for getting to work and for transporting larger items. It's easy to drive and has good gas mileage.
"03 21, 2017",Best car yet.,"Purchased my Rav4 through Prestige Toyota of Kingston. Joseph Rodelli has the patience of a saint! Took me a while to make up my mind, but I'm definitely pleased with my purchase."
"03 10, 2017",2012 Toyota RAV4,"The Toyota RAV4 is a great car. It's reliable, safe, spacious, sleek, and has all the basic features you would want your car to have. I've never had an issue with my car, I trust it completely. The seats aren't as comfortable as some other cars, but that's not too big of a deal to me. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a safe, gas efficient car."
"03  9, 2017",We love our used RAV4!,"It's beautiful, comfortable, well-designed, efficient, a dream to drive, and it was such a great deal from Toyota On The Park in Toronto. Great dealership and repair place. We are 100% happy. Love it!"
"05 28, 2016",Nice small car,You don't need the v 6.  3 row seat is a waist of money.Not comfortable to drive if over six foot.Weak a.c.. Nice car and runs good but get a loaded limited..
"06 10, 2015",Rav4,"Love my new Rav4. I've only had it a week, but I can tell you, I feel safe in it and secure with my decision in purchasing one. Toyota's are dependable, safe and they hold their value for years to come. I would recommend one to anybody. Great car!"
"03 11, 2014",The most valuable small SUV,"I purchased 2012 Sport V4 model to replace 2005 Sienna Van. I rented a Hyundi Santa Fe for roadtrip before my purchsing. I also tested Nissan Rouge and Honda CRV. Rav4 and Honda CRV were on the final run. I choice Toyota because the package met my need for the price that I expected.

Less than one year later, my wife purchased the 2013 CRV base model.

Now, I can tell you the true experience of these two competitors as the user.

They both have same performance.

Rav4 2012 is the last year of the old model. Its interior was designed for V6 w/7 seat optiopn. The 2nd row seat can be slided back and forth. My 5 seat get extra leg room when I push back. Because mine is 5 seat model. It has X-extra huge cargo space. Put down the 2nd row seat, I can still get a flat space like a bed when I going out for camping like driving Sienna van. The 6 speakers audio has excellent sound quality. The only Con's for this car from my experience are 2:
1. The doors are very light, so most of times I have push a little when closing the door.
2. The gas tank is only 12 gal. I believe this is a compromise for the other X-extra features for 7 seat option. I believe this has been changed to 16 gal. in 2013 new model. Of cause, you will not get those X-extra space from 2013 model.
My Sport model come with roof window, rack, buletooth and MP3, USB and back-up camera.
I used to buy long lumbers from HomeDepot when I drove Sienna van. Although Rav4 is not as long as Sienna van , I can still buy plenty of 2x6x(8+ size). My Rav4 Sport model has #3 gear which help picking up speed on highway when I need.

Honda has better interior (roomy). The windshield was pushed forward with wider glass to get more space. The interior width is also a little wider than Rav4. The driver's seat has arm rest which is good for long trip. The back-up camera(rear monitor) has become standard feature which is very thoughtful for high position vehicle. The cargo space is huge too. CRV has smaller turning radious for you make U-turn.

They both make you feel very steady while driving on the curving road. They both very reliable, comfort, good driver's view to all around the traffic. The price is difficult to compare each other. I will think they are pretty much the same if same features, but unfortuantely their different trims equipted with different features.

Toyota Rav4 (even though 2013 model) is a little sporty looking while CRV is more like city car. You shall pick what you need. You will like either one. Both Toyota and Honda make good value products.

So far, I have 10500 miles on my Rav4 and over 5000 miles on CRV.

My Rav4 perform 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the roadtrip with premium gas.

My wife has never counted the mpg for her CRV. I think it is about the same in city. I guess the roadtrip mpg shall be a little better if we try Eco-mode. She mentioned one time about Eco-mode and said ""You don't want use this feature in the town even though on highway because the system will run with less power."" I guess that Eco-mode will be very helpful if we go for roadtrip in Wild West.

Hope these true experience are helpful for you."
"01 24, 2014",Great buy,"We really like this car! Got it because we're expecting a baby and wNt something reliable and functional. We got it from Maguire Toyota in Ithaca, NY, and Bridget helped us. She was fantastic- never pressured us, just showed us everything we wanted to see, gave us more information, and answered all our questions. We'll be going back there for our next vehicle purchase,"
"11 25, 2013","Like the car, but. . .","RAV is a good choice, generally. Can't beat it for dependability, resale, etc. Not very exciting in the interior, although it's OK. I like the external spare, but that's going away, along with leather seat covers and V6 power. Uses tons of fuel, but that's true with the smaller engine as well."
"09  8, 2013","Very good on gas milage, reliable and beautiful.","Very good on gas milage.
Nice,cozy interior and beautifully crafted exterior.
Spacious trunk for shopping and for reasonable haulage.
Easily accessible driving features and equiped with some modern car technology. Loving It."
"07 28, 2013",Loving it!,"Looks great, drives great. I bought it for the AWD feature for winter driving. I'm happy it will have the power when I need it, and has great gas mileage."
"07 22, 2013",My Dream UV I Never Knew!,"I am amazed at the comfort and security this vehicle gives me once I get behind the wheel. The difference in the gas mileage expenditure has improved from day one. I love the GPS feature and Blue tooth, which have come in so handy for me with my kids/family/co-workers! I love my Rav4! THANKS JESSE!!"
"03  7, 2013",great car!,The seller and finance personnel were all very helpful and proffessional. But best of all i got the best deal in the market! I love my new toyota rav4!!!
"02 28, 2013",AWESOME!,"We just love this vehicle! Within 15 minutes of purchasing I was traveling 300 miles. It rode smoothly, I feel safe in it, comfy...simple WE LOVE IT!"
"02 23, 2013",like the v6 power. Goooooo,"I have a 2007 Rav4 and use it for travel. The V6 give you the option of getting out of the way or hitting the brakes. the interstates are test of survival. So when I found out that toyota was getting rid of the V6 safety feature, I purchased the 2012 with the V6. Now the 2013 Rav4 looks like all the rest. Oh hum"
"01 29, 2013",Mitsubishi,"Happy with car after purchase. There is nothing more to say than, what a nice car. It was the cae that caught my eye on the road"
"01 24, 2013",Found a great car at a great price,"Haven't had it long enough to really tell yet, but so far, I am more than satisfied. The ride is a little stiff. The gas mileage has been better than expected."
"01 22, 2013",Great Solid Driver,"Drove them all found the Rav 4 to be the most solid feeling Cross over in it's class. Nice feel on the hi-way, great brakes, comfortable firm but not harsh ride."
"01 17, 2013",Bought Toyotas since 1976,"We've bought Toyotas since we were married in 1976. We have found them to be very realiable. We're had corolla, camrays, Supra, Thundra, other trucks, and this is my second Rav 4"
"01 15, 2013",Outstanding buying expierence!,"As a long term West Herr customer, I recently referred a friend to ""Casey Mac Alpine"" at West Herr Toyota of Williamsville. Just wanted to express the great customer service that my friend received from ""Casey""which was ""Class A all the way. She mentioned that this was the best car buying experience that she has ever had in the many years of dealing with sales people. She felt that the he listened and cared!"
"01 14, 2013",Fun little in-town car,"Fun to drive, Not a luxury car, nice little commuter that holds a lot. Great on gas. I use the Rav4 to get to and from work about 5 miles each way. I also have horses and need to hall feed from time to time and this little SUV does it all. Recently put 10 bags of shavings in it with no trouble at all. I needed a car with good gas mileage and could hall feed, and large dogs. This Rav4 seems to do it all with ease. So far I love it. Don't think i would like it on a long trip."
"01  9, 2013",best suv,looks great feels good great ride. Has many extra's and toyota is big on all the small details and extras
"01  6, 2013",Worst experience,"First off, my family has always owned a Toyota and NEVER ever had problems. We were always satisfied by how reliable the quality of Toyota vehicles were.

With an almost 1 yr old and me being pregnant, my husband and I decided we needed to buy a brand new car. He wanted a Ford or Jeep, but I insisted on Toyota. I did so much research and showed him all the great consumer and expert reviews on the Rav4. He finally caved in and we bought a brand new 2012 Rav4.

We got it in August 2012 and loved it! But then 3 months later (1,200 mileage only) in November (we live in the UK by the way, stationed in England), it broke down on me and my daughter at night in the cold. We were stuck for 1.5hr trying to get help and then finally a friend was able to get us but he tried to drive it too, and it broke down on him too. I know my prego hormones were out of wack, but it was awful and my daughter was crying hysterically by the way. We were cold and scared!

My husband tried to drive it to the Cambridge Toyota center but it broke down on him too and he had to wait 4hrs and 40 mins for someone to tow it to the dealership.

Then it took almost 2 weeks to figure out what was wrong with it. My husband who was deploying the following week at first was asking friends for rides to his deployment appointments and briefings, but since it was taking longer than expected we had to rent a car (which is not covered by warranty). It was just the worst timing ever.

The fuel pump pressure was defective. Warranty covered it and is ""fixed"" they say, but apparently it is still causing problems because our neighbors who are currently watching the car for us (they'll be watching it for about 6 months) says it still runs when they drive it, but it feels like it might stall at stops. It hasn't stalled yet, but STILL, what safety is that?!

Sorry Toyota, this experience totally made me never want to own one, and not only do I feel betrayed by Toyota's reliable past, I also feel like I disrespected my husband by not considering the Ford or Jeep he wanted. Should have just listened to him and trusted him!

Totally disappointed and not looking forward to going back to the UK to drive a potentially hazardous car for our family."
"12 20, 2012",G-Man,"This is the third Rav4 I've owned. They never disappoint. Excellent performance, comfort, and very
reliable. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space, comes in
handy, on many occasions. Living in New England, the
Rav4, enables you to drive in any condition, with confidence. I've had a direct influence on six friends,
who also purchased Rav4's."
"12 19, 2012",RECOMMEND TO ALL,"CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, RECOMMEND TO ALL.PERFECT SO EASY TO DRIVE, WARRENTY IS GREAT, MAINTANCE IS EXCELLENT."
"12 10, 2012",Excellent!,"Best car I've ever owned ... I traded a 2009 RAV4 for my 2012! Great mileage, comfort, style, perfect for toting my amps and guitars to gigs. Love it!"
"10 31, 2012",RAV,"This is the fourth Toyota in our household and my second RAV4. My first RAV4 was 12yrs old, and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was to get the down payment to buy a newer one. I got a great price when I sold my 2001 RAV4 - had I been able to keep the old one and still buy the new one, I would have b/c I LOVE my RAVs!"
"10 26, 2012",Excellent little car,Care has plenty of pep and get-up-and-go for a 4-cylinder engine. The handling is superb. Very pleased with leg room. Good dependable care for the money. Would recommend to a friend
"10 22, 2012",The RAV4 Sport,"Fabulous vehicle, way more room than the Honda CR-V! Strongly influenced by owning a 2003 Matrix for 8 years! Durable, long lasting, and reliable! Never doubted the vehicle for a second! I am very happy about my Dad's advice and gearing me towards a RAV4 Sport! Absolutely outstanding. My husband jokingly and lovingly says; ""All you ever do is have a nicer car than your husband!""

Love it!"
"10 17, 2012",Very comfortable,"I'm 6'4"" with arthritis in knees and hips. The RAV4 allows me to travel for more than 1 1/2 hrs before I need to stop to relieve knee and hip pain. There is also more than ample headroom."
"09 28, 2012",Need more seat time to be totally objective,"Great mid size SUV.
Good Fuel economy.
Great Ride with good cornering stability.
Toyo Open country tires noisy on some furfaces."
"09 23, 2012",Safe and Reliable Small SUV,"This is the second RAV4 we have owned. It is a nice little SUV for our needs, we purchased for reliability and the value we got for the money. Very easy to drive and has all the safety features you need in a modern vehicle including the backup camera. Plenty of room in the back for all our stuff and a Kayak on top of the racks. Plus my wife likes how the higher stance of the vehicle gives her a better view of the road. The RAV4 fits our lifestyle and needs."
"09 21, 2012",32 mpg on hwy,"minimum 28 mpg through yellowstone, tetons,rockies. almost drives itself.only a four cylinder but plenty power."
"09 10, 2012",Just another car,"It is an okay car, if my Honda was not totaled I would not have bought this. According to the on car mpg gauge we are only getting 21 mpg."
"08 24, 2012",Rav4 Review,"Stylish , Innovative, Contemporary Toyota Moving Forward! Vast Improvement over last years mOdel, no recalls yet?"
"08 24, 2012",My New Rav 4,"I've been a Toyota person forever. Prior to this SUV, I had a Yaris - which is fantastic on gas. I needed a vehicle for the snow, plus a larger one for my dogs. I absolutely love my SUV, roomy enough, and it sits high enough (like a truck) so I can see past the vehicle ahead of me. It rides so smootlhly and I can't wait to use all the gadgets I've never had before in a car. For a larger vehicle that I am used to - it is doing exceptionally well on gas. (I average 26.5 mpg) This is in the city - mind you. This is also the first vehicle I've had which is automatic. I have to remind myself not to shift & not to clutch. Other than this, I love my new Rav-ioli."
"08 23, 2012",Better than govt. motors,Got tired of poor quality of gm dealers. Tired of their shoddy service and excuses. Bought Toyota. Best personal service of dealers and sales. Most courteous and genuine. WONT GO BACK TO GM.
"08 23, 2012",Raving over the Rav 4,"It took me a long time to settle on and buy exactly what I wanted. The Toyota Rav 4 Sport V6. It's fun to drive, surprisingly quick and responsive, looks amazing (sport w/appearance package) and toyota's reliability is bar none. I wish that they offered navigation systems in the other models besides the limited, but I'll just have to use the maps on my smart phone. Great all round, 4 seasons car."
"08 21, 2012",love my suv,It is what I wanted and thank the dealer for making it possible. Love the way it drives and the way it looks.
"08 14, 2012",RAV4 SPORT RED,"I bought RAV4 Sport, ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy... if you driving by yourself, I guess it?s O.K.. it?s not good for family ride. First couple of years I use to get good gas mileage, then it?s drop to around 17-19 miles? I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. If I wait till 5K there won't be any oil to change, it burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 3 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's normal. What I am hearing and reading almost all the TOYOTA cars are BURNING OIL like crazy. Now I just add oil every other month, seems like I made a big mistake buying the RAV4,, after 4-recall I think I am done with TOYOTA!!"
"07 12, 2012",Must have,I love this car and the stylish new look. I have the sport and it's a beautiful SUV. Must have........
"06 29, 2012",now a two rav4 family,the 97 rav 4 is sweet with no problems other than normal service which is expected so we added a new one to the family which is the 2012 rav4 limited and passed on the 4 wheel drive and 6 cylinder as we live in Florida and wanted the best millage and did not have the need for a 6 or 4x4 as our new 2012 rav has more power than the 97 which is fine everywhere fully loaded with camp equipment except for going up mountains where I could not even meet the 55 mph speed limit so expect the new rav to hanndle that even better
"05  6, 2012",2nd Toyota SUV - after Chevys and Benzs...,"Since last few weeks I am enjoying my new 2012 Toyota RAV4 Sport 4WD, it is really a nice vehicle.
Bluetooth works great, Fuel wise is also very echonomical, drive smooth."
"04 19, 2012",2nd RAV 4 I've Owned,"This is the 2nd RAV 4 I've Owned. Traded in a 2002 Model RAV 4 for the 2012 Model. It's quite different and I still love it. It's larger, roomier and still great to handle. I especially like the roomier back seat and the larger cargo area. Looked at some competitor's vehicles but came back to the RAV 4 mostly for the reliability and great value."
"04 16, 2012",My Rav,"This is the best car i ever own, I always wanted it. If I didnt get it I woudnt feel right. When you really want something you have to go for it!!"
"04 12, 2012",Love it so far,"I just got my 2012 Rav4 a few weeks ago and took it on a 14 hours round trip to Virginia with no problems. I averaged 25mpg- not awesome but I'll take it. It was very car-like and easy to handle and also very comfortable. Visibility was fine. You do have to watch for wind - common with taller cars but I was driving a tiny sedan previously so it was not something I was used to right away. I love the bluetooth capability and the controls on the dash - something I did not really think I would care about. Since I went from CNY (40 degrees) to Va (65 degrees) I got to use both heat and a/c: both were fine. Lots of storage space throughout. My friend just traded in her 12 year old Rav 4 with over 140,000mi on it. I hope mine lasts that long!"
"11  9, 2023",Insufficient time line for Blizzard Pearl recall.,"The exterior received 1 star as the Blizzard Pearl paint looked great before its now ongoing pealing frenzy. 
The 2012 RAV4 is great in every aspect for its generation though the Blizzard Pearl isn’t holding up. 
The Blizzard Pearl paint, as good looking as it is, or paint prep is failing in a big way. The roof was pealing above the windshield aprox. 4 years ago, its repainting was cover per the extended warranty. Now 1 year after the warranty expired the hood, drivers side front post, drivers side passenger door and the rear hatch are all pealing. Blizzard Pearl! It’s now a looker going down the road for a different reason."
"07  6, 2023",To many problems in this Suv,This SUV HAS A SO MUCH PROBLEM I HAVE 2012 RAV4 51000 MILES IN MY SUV BURN OIL WHEEL SENIOR NO GOOD AIR BEG PROBLEM SEAT BELT PROBLEM AND FEW MORE PROBLEM WITH 2012 TOYOTA RAV4
"04 14, 2023",2012 Rav 4 is a gem.,I had a 2012 Rav 4 and a man ran a red light and ran over me and the Rav had to be junked. I got my second 2012 Rav 4 and both were and are wonderful cars. Would highly reccommend.
"01 27, 2023","RAV4 Sport v6, no better price for a 4WD","I had researched small/compact SUV vehicles in their respective class. Toyota known for reliability and quality for the price was on top of my list.
It took me a years time to have gotten lucky enough on a trade in at a local dealer. My timing was right on as when I arrived l looked it over before speaking with a rep. I overheard employees saying that the RAV4 Sport v6 check all the boxes and was a unicorn in and out. The owner must have taken a hit which after test driving it, it was straight as an arrow with minor slight blemishes for a 8 year old vehicle. I knew to make an offer, which was listed at $15,500. It was the end of the month, so it was approved to sell at $1000. Off if I took it that day. “Deal” and ever since driving it away with my temporary papers, I knew I found the SUV 4WD I’ve been looking for.
Right place, right time. I still have it and it’s a workhorse, and have put about 15k on it to which It had 60k when I purchased it.
Great buy, and say goodbye to v6 engines as the car companies need to go green and the future is about EV."
"04  5, 2021",Love love love it!,Everything mechanically was checked out and fixed by the dealer before driving off the lot. I love the low miles and great deal I got.
"03 31, 2021",This car is like my old one with way less miles.,It’s like brand new. It’s 4 years newer than my old car that has 260k miles. This has 65k miles. That’s why I bought another one. Love the v6 Rav 4. Hope they make it again.
"02  2, 2021",Best reliable suv I've ever owned,"This SUV didn't only meet my expectations,  it's far surpassed them.  Good on gas,  nice smooth ride,  and has not given me one problem.  2010-2012 is the best year,  that's my opinion."
"01 23, 2021",My favorite vehicle I’ve owned,It is perfect for what I need in a vehicle. Plenty of space to haul whatever I need. I like the styling and the overall design.
"01  3, 2021",Extremely reliable and spacious,"This car was very reliable and spacious. Not much for luxury, but it was a fantastic value, had plenty of space, and was good on gas."
"08 11, 2020",I Love My RAV4!,"I bought my RAV4 in 2015. It was 3 years old with 23,000 miles on it. Five years later I have 117,000 miles on it and I couldn't be happier. I take care of normal maintenance and haven't had any unexpected repairs at all. Reliability is of utmost importance to me and its been flawless. I love the interior space and how it sits up high. Its fun to drive and great looking, too. This 2012 RAV4 has been exceptionally good for me."
"08  6, 2020",Very clean car for the money spent!,So far the car is running just fine it had low miles and is in very good shape. It’s hard to find a car this year that doesn’t have a lot of miles!!
"06 22, 2020",Amazing Safety Even Without Fancy Features,"I owned the 2012 RAV-4 from 2015-2020, bought it used. Never had any major maintenance issues even at 70k miles. The only reason I no longer own it is because of an accident; I hydroplaned on the highway, skidded across four lanes of traffic, and slammed into a guardrail—the car was sadly totalled, but there wasn't a single scratch on me. The safety and reliability of this car is unmatched for its class."
"01 27, 2020",This the best value for money car in any segment,"I got the 7 seater 4 cyl with dealer modified Sunroof etc. I fitted a android navigation unit to replace the original CD unit. 
This car never failed in snow, desert, highways or city. I drove it for 65K miles in NJ, CA & GA and it always did the job with very little maintenance like Battery, tires and Brakes. Get tires from tire shop and not from dealer as they sell very bad tires.
It is under powered compared to a V6 only on gradient roads. It can still be quick on the highways."
"01 27, 2020",one of the best cars i ever owned.,"i drove this car for the past five years and no problem ever. It is an 
excellent drive and very low maintenance and fantastic gas millage."
"12 31, 2019",Best affordable car ever!,"Not luxurious, but ROOMY, COMFORTABLE, & RELIABLE. No issues ever!  Perfect seat-height for us seniors. Easy getting in/out. Great, tight turning-radius.  Would definitely buy again."
"12 31, 2019",Love Toyota RAV4 this is my second,I’ve been spoiled for other cars by the RAV4. My last one had over 195k miles. I’m looking for even better longevity with this one.
"12  8, 2019",Very nice comfortable car!,This car has plenty space and not too big. The seats are comfortable. The car is smooth to drive. I liked that car very much.
"11 30, 2019",I heard fantastic things about this vehicle,"Everything I was looking for.  I was looking for something that sat higher, a vehicle with storage space and would do great in all weather conditions."
"11 12, 2019",Tank of a car,"Two weeks and one day after I bought this car I was rear-ended by a Ford focus hatchback.

The girl texting and driving had to have her vehicle towed from the scene, and the spare tire on mine took most of the damage. She still did about $3,000 worth of damage, but I was able to drive away.

The car can use a better sound system, and the seats are okay - but it's a tank in the snow, and so far has been great."
"09  2, 2019",Disappointed ☹️,"The brakes make a clicking noise. The paint is coming off in sheets on the passenger side, and the windshield wipers are almost inoperable. I’ve taken the car in twice and nothing happened. The dealership does not  respond to my questions nor does the manufacturer."
"08 27, 2019",So far it's very nice,"We've only owned it for a little over a week but so far it's been a good vehicle. From experience I know that Toyota makes some very good cars and trucks, that's why we went with this."
"07 18, 2019",Great vehicle for light 4x4,"I've owned this car for almost 4 years now. It has been rock solid from day one, and has never shown any problems. It is just big enough to fit 2 adults and 3 kids (2 in boosters, 1 in car-seat). It has been great for long trips, and gets decent gas mileage.

My biggest complaint about the car was that the cargo door opens up the wrong way. When I park on the right side of the street, the door opens out to the right. So now I can't just unload right onto the curb, I have to carry thing around the door."
"07  7, 2019",Best in Total cost of ownership,"Dealers were nice during maintenance. Yes they were pushy, but I was careful. Don't use stick tires or battery. Costco has better options. Driver seat is not comfortable for a 6 foot folks. I have a seven seater that was used when there are guests."
"06 25, 2019",My last 5 cars have been Toyotas.,Great on back roads.  Toyotas run forever. The only problem is that the last owner was a heavy smoker.  My dealer was great —- I would buy from him again.
"06  5, 2019",Love Love this !!!,"Love the look of the Rav4,  and how much room there is in the back. Can't wait to be riding the roads and showing it off!"
"05  1, 2019","Bought in Blue Springs MO and drove it to LA, CA","This RAV 4 performed really well on a long trip to LA the day after I bought it used. It handled the cold, the desert and the mountains effortlessly.  I would highly recommend buying a used vehicle from Universal Auto Plaza Blue Springs, MO."
"03 22, 2019",Works for my fam!,It’s a great car for nuclear family. I’d recommend it for folks who’d want to go on road trips and have stuff to carry on.
"01 20, 2019",It is the most reliable car.,Yes this car did meet my needs as has always been and I will recommend a friend ant time to buy or service their car .
"10 26, 2018",I love the style size the great pickup from the v,This suv is great meets all my needs that?s why I selected this vehicle plus low maintenance dependable performance reliable handles very well great pickup too
"08 15, 2018",Love this car!,After I broke my hip I had to trade my Fit for a higher sitting car. Thought about a crv but decided on the Rav instead & never regretted my decision.
"07 27, 2018",RAV4 are the best cars we've ever owned!,"Great size, V6 has crazy amazing power, 3 rows of seats in an SUV this size is outstanding. Reliability is top notch and service is a breeze.  Best family car ever with great features for the value.  Our favorite care to date and we've had 3!!!"
"07 26, 2018",I feel safe driving it in really any conditions.,"This car has been great for me!  I needed something that would drive well in the snow, and it has done that and more.  It technically can fit 7 (which is really nice at times) but the back 2 seats have very little legroom, so stick your short friends back there."
"07  3, 2018",Been a great vehicle.,Has met all of my needs. Upkept very well. Never been in the shop except for routine maintenance issues. Only selling because I want to buy a newer model.
"06 21, 2018","great, comfortable car.","I bought this car new and have all of the service records and manuals.  It is a great ride, good visibility, comfortable and reliable. It is a high end model with leather interior and weather tech floor mats. Blue tooth phone connection."
"06 19, 2018",Third RAV4 and looking forward to the next...,I absolutely love my RAV4 - as mentioned this is my third one.  All three of my RAVs were V6 engine - won't buy the 4 cylinder.  The RAV has the largest cargo space of any vehicle in it's class.  Loads of room!  I can't wait for the 2019 - new EVERYTHING - remodeled with technology in mind.  Seriously - you cannot go wrong with a used RAV.  Love my car!
"06 15, 2018",good car for hauling,this has been a very good car for big loads. The only problem is there is not enough leg room for the mean in our family
"06 13, 2018",Excellent car all around!,This is a great car. Never given me any problems. I can haul a ton of stuff. Very comfortable and roomy. I would buy this car again.
"06  6, 2018",Fantastic auto,"We bought our 2012 rav4 sport v6 and new off the lot in 2012.  Been a super vehicle.  Don't listen to others get the v6.  It is far better then the 4 and actually gets better gas mileage.  It has 70,000 miles on it now with absolutely no problems.  I would definitely buy it again."
"06  5, 2018",My Favorite Car!,"I've owned a lot of cars, got to be at least 15, in my life. This one is by far my favorite! It's pretty, fast, reliable and all around everything I love in a car."
"05 29, 2018",love it,"Runs nice, comfortable, lots of room and storage space. I bought it used and it is the best uses car I have purchased to date. Great car, would def recommend to another person"
"05 21, 2018",Great small SUV for the money.,"The RAV4 is s dependable small SUV with excellent intetior space. It is a very good SUV for family trips that require space for luggage, coolers and sports gear."
"05  6, 2018",They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!,Great ride and much sportier to drive than the larger Highlander and 4 Runner.  The interior layout is perfect!  The cargo area is probably the largest in the compact SUV class (at this time).  Too bad you can no longer get a V6 option (2012 was the last year):  That makes this great car truly outstanding!
"05  4, 2018",LOVE THIS CAR,"VERY NICE CONDITION, LIKE THE AMENITIES, DRIVES GREAT AND I HOPE IT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO PAY IT OFF -- LOOKING FORWAARD TO DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT"
"05  3, 2018",Excellent transportation in the winter,Perfect family vehicle. Roomy. Gas mileage was as good as I?ve gotten. Long road trips were made w/ it on a monthly basis. Never had a single issue.
"05  2, 2018",Most reliable vehicle ever,"My 2012 Toyota RAV4 has been a great friend to me. It has helped tremendously in every winter storm for the last three years. Cheap on gas, extremely reliable, this is definitely an excellent vehicle!!"
"04 13, 2018",Fun drive,A very fun drive and a lot of space. We used it for moving stuff all the time. Great drive for snow days. Great value and gas mileage.
"04 11, 2018",Excellent Vehicle,"Powerful V6 engine, comfortable ride. Very reliable. It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. I do not expect to ever sell it."
"03  3, 2018",I so in love with this car very reliable,Omg fits my needs love the space something different it's fits me.and all love the storage space as well best vehicle every the kids love it great price.
"02 24, 2018",Great Reliability and Practicality,"Very reliable
Cheap to maintain
Holds value very good as for a used car
I recommend to buy 4cylinder with all wheel drive, most popular model and will always have demend"
"02 20, 2018","Why do my lights keep comeing on,4x4, traction con","The rav4 comes up with a code o2 sensor, bank 1 sensor 2. You change it then comes rite back on along with 4?4  light and traction control  light. So you change it again. 17 miles latter they are back on .  Why. Alot of people are having same problem"
"02  7, 2018",One of the best Vehicle that I owned,I owned and driven 100s of cars in my lifetime. I worked at many car rental companies for 20 years. This vehicle will always my top recommendation to everyone
"02  3, 2018",Great looking and fun to drive car!,"I am a big Toyota fan with this 2012 RAV4 being the 7th Toyota I have owned.  They have all been very reliable, fun to drive, and go forever.   This is the first time I have owned a RAV4 though but so far so good as it seems to represent the Toyota brand like all others.  It is comfortable with the basic options, powerful enough with the 4-cylinder engine, and feels very safe driving.   Great car!"
"01 29, 2018",very stable free way driving,itsan amazing Small SUV.  lots of room for cargo. fun to drive. very good on gasoline. small enough to fit a any space like regular car.
"01 23, 2018",great Car!,"I got this car in 2015. I got it used with 18k miles on it.  I use it as my daily driver  and it's perfect  for San franciscos pothole filled streets. Though it's only a 2wheel drive, I have taken her camping to Yosemite, death valley, Zion, grand staircase escalante, Bruce canyon, Vegas, l.a., tahoe. it's great for camping for 2 people as you can fit lots of stuff in the back with the seats down. you can travel with 2 people in the back on long drives but the back seats need much better cushioning. 3 in the back is fine but might be uncomfortable for long drives. your passengers must really like each other. back seats recline. I also used my rav for moving and hauling Ikea items. the 176hp is sufficient enough for me. it has good pick up. the one I have is the standard 2wd. I think I would opt for 4wd next time just because I like to travel to more places."
"01 18, 2018","Rav 4, the car to have in the winter","An excellent vehicle for us.  It is a V6 so it has plenty of hustle in traffic and the  mpg's we get is very satisfactory at 25 on trips and 23 -24 around town.  An excellent vehicle for winter driving as well.   I would recommend a Rav, but only if the V6 was brought back.  Too bad it is no longer available in newer models."
"01 12, 2018",Best car I've ever owned!,"I love this vehicle! Well-made, safe, solid, fuel-efficient, comfortable, with lots of smart and convenient design features. Bought used from Toyota on the Park -- what a great deal and great dealership!"
"01  8, 2018",Toyota Rav4 Limited Excellent style and performanc,This SUV is comfortable with excellent head and leg room. Comfortable for Highway Travel long distances. Heated seats for winter. Driver and passenger visibility is outstanding. Dual comfort climate control makes it nice in summer and winter. Dependable with good gas mileage for full passengers and cargo ride.
"11 17, 2017",One of the greatest crossovers to ever exist!,"I own the basic 4WD V6 RAV4 2012 Model, yes the last V6 Model every made by Toyota. This car made it through a 36 hour drive to Georgia and back with no problems! The vehicle performance is similar to a Camry Sport feel, and the acceleration is powerful! It feels like I'm sitting in a  race car when I hop behind the wheel of my RAV4. If you are able to find one, get one. The 2013 and up models do not compare to this beast."
"11  7, 2017","Five years, 80.000 miles",One minor repair in all this time.  29.5mpg overall. Love the driving position and the handling of the vehicle.
"11  5, 2017",Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned,I love the reliability of my RAV4 and how it performs. I have owned or leased many cars.. Best brand
"11  3, 2017",Best Car Ever,"I love this car so much. It is comfortable and reliable, with tons of trunk space and good visibility."
"10 27, 2017",Fantastic SUV,"I love my Rav4. There's a lot more room than you would think. It comfortably fits 5, with lots of trunk space. I can't wait to test the 4WD this winter!"
"10 14, 2017","Overall OK, but need input.","I have a 2012 Rav4, (5 years old) Overall the car has been a good investment.  I have had a problem with the service lights on the dash, (Service Engine, 4-WD, and Track Off) remaining on. I had the O2 sensor replaced as the code read indicated was the problem. A few miles down the road  after the repair, the lights came on again, and the O2 sensor was again listed as the problem.  There are many people on-line with the same problem, (some have paid thousands of dollars trying to find the cause).  Toyota told me it was my car and that I should continue spending money to find out the problem.  Anyone else with this vehicle that might have suggestions?  I'm pretty frustrated with Toyota right now and wanted to share this concern to other owners who might have the same issues.  Other than that, the car works fine."
"10  9, 2017",Another Excellent Toyota Car,"I've owned my RAV4 since 2012 and I love it. I never had any problems with it since. I trust the brand name Toyota for its excellent commitment to their customers. I am not a car enthusiast but i know that if you want a vehicle for keeps, get a Toyota."
"10  6, 2017",great replacement for crv...,"hoping for best here....bought to replace older Honda crv--this has last year of v6 engine with heavy tow  package, so i can tow more than the Honda 1600 # limit.....although  rides stiffer due to run-flat tires and sport suspension tuning.....but everything else is what i wanted."
"10  2, 2017",Great SUV,"Love the 2012 RAV4 Limited with 4WD, 25 mpg, heated seats, remote start, backup camera, Bluetooth, and more. Mine has had bullet proof reliability and low maintenance costs. I wish the driver's seat was more comfortable and the interior design was upgraded. It has a huge amount of cargo room and I like the side opening tail gate."
"09 19, 2017",Great Reliable Car for the money,"Good car, rides well, good in snow -  a good safe car.  It was rated well for safety.  It is not a fast car, however drives well."
"09 15, 2017",Very happy Rav4 owner,"I havent had my Rav4 long, but i absolutely love it.  It seems very versatile and adequate for darn near anything.  I've been surprised by the power it has despite being a four cyclinder yet stays very efficient as well.  I like the interior design but do wish for a little more leg room for the backseat.  I prefer the boxier maybe jeepier look of the 2012 and older but i have heard friends with this era model complain about the rear door being too heavy with the spare tire, and that they have trouble closing while parked on a hill and that the hinges are insufficient.  I bought mine used and while the door seems fine it does rattle a bit upon closing.  I needed a family vehicle and efficient commuter car with awd and this hits all the boxes and then some.  All with Toyota's legendary reliability.  Im a person who wants to be in love with his vehicle and keep it til it dies and i imagine im gonna have this Rav4 for a long time!"
"09  5, 2017",Reliability is what I look for in a car,This car is nice looking car that is reliability. I found this car drives well on winter snow and ice. There is space to hold 5 adults and luggage for travel. I recommend this car. In fact I own two Rav4 cars.
"09  1, 2017",Overall great vehicle!,"We needed a vehicle larger than a car, but smaller than an SUV and this is the perfect size. Reliable, comfortable & plenty of truck space for traveling."
"08 19, 2017",Realiable as always in a Toyota,"Great riding vehicle and it handles excellent... also good vehicle for the price ...it's a sporty, SUV and it's the best as far as reliability.."
"08 18, 2017",This car met all my needs.,Very close to my former Lexus RX330 I used to own. Very spacious and great driving for bad weather condition.
"08  9, 2017",Great vehicle - very reliable,"I have really enjoyed owning my 2012 RAV4 Sport V6 - easy to drive, easy to park, handles like a sports car, great in the mountains and the snow. It is big enough for a small family of 4, has enough cargo room for normal jobs, and with the V6 and trailer hitch can tow my small utility trailer or 1500lb boat with ease. I'm just sad they don't make this vehicle / engine combo any longer - don't know what I will replace it with when it is time."
"07 22, 2017",Rad RAV4,"I LOVE being a RAV4 driver. This car is my pride and joy. Reliable and very attractive. 
I have the limited model, so the vehicle has leather/heated seats, a moon/sunroof, backup camera, and all the bells and whistles. It is absolutely my dream car. Toyota's are great cars and this is no exception. However, I do not care much for the body style of the RAV4's after 2012, so anything 2013+ does not interest me much. 

A used RAV will serve you well! The gas mileage is good for an SUV/crossover. Spacious on the inside with LOTS of trunk room. 

Love this car!"
"07  1, 2017",Beautiful car,"Driving this car, I knew right away that tho car was for me. Perfect size for my family of 5.  Beautiful inside and out, lots of technology."
"07  1, 2017",Great car,"Wonderful car, has a ton of room for my family of 5. Comfortable, and was built well and very reliable."
"06 26, 2017",Love the V6 engine!!,"I love having the extra power of the V6 because I drive in the mountains often. I wish I had a sunroof and feel like the space in the front seats could be designed better. Like having more compartments for phone, purse, etc would be nice. I love how the seats lay down flat in the back and I can sleep back there when I'm camping. Also love the extra storage compartment in the back where the spare tire would normally be."
"06 18, 2017",not my favorite car that i have owned,it meets my needs i dont have any problems with it but it is not very comfortable and it is not the best looking car in the world
"06 12, 2017",One of the safest cars by consumer reports!,"Awesome! I feel that it is one of the safest vehicles for my family to ride in. I love it, and it is very reliable, sporty, fun vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Easy to drive,The Rav4 is easy to drive and handles well. The turning radius is the smallest I have ever experienced.  The wheel lock button should be useful for getting out of snow or ice or mud. The interior has lots of space when the seats fold down. Highly recommended.
"05 23, 2017",IT IS OKAY IF YOU ARE BYE YOURSELF,"OKAY. at the time i needed something to go back and forth to GA it serve it purposed for what I need it for. If you are a big person it is not a good truck to have to small for anyone over 5 ft.
other wise it is a good truck. good on gas."
"05 23, 2017","Toyota Rav4, sensible and reliable","Bought my 2012 Rav4 new in 2012. 46k miles later, no repairs other than brakes and tires. Reliable , comfortable, love my heated seats.  Wish the engine and road noise weren't so loud."
"05 12, 2017",Very Reliable,Its good its got good mileage it got a good doors. its got good wheels. all four wheels work really well. everythings pretty good the seats are very comfortable
"04 24, 2017",Great Toyota product,I love my Rav4 and plan to be buying a new one in the next year or so very likely!  Toyota has been the most reliable trouble free vehicles I have ever owned and would not think of switching brands!
"04 10, 2017",Reliable & Versatile,It's been very reliable and versatile. Great for getting to work and for transporting larger items. It's easy to drive and has good gas mileage.
"03 21, 2017",Best car yet.,"Purchased my Rav4 through Prestige Toyota of Kingston. Joseph Rodelli has the patience of a saint! Took me a while to make up my mind, but I'm definitely pleased with my purchase."
"03 10, 2017",2012 Toyota RAV4,"The Toyota RAV4 is a great car. It's reliable, safe, spacious, sleek, and has all the basic features you would want your car to have. I've never had an issue with my car, I trust it completely. The seats aren't as comfortable as some other cars, but that's not too big of a deal to me. I'd recommend this car to anyone looking for a safe, gas efficient car."
"03  9, 2017",We love our used RAV4!,"It's beautiful, comfortable, well-designed, efficient, a dream to drive, and it was such a great deal from Toyota On The Park in Toronto. Great dealership and repair place. We are 100% happy. Love it!"
"05 28, 2016",Nice small car,You don't need the v 6.  3 row seat is a waist of money.Not comfortable to drive if over six foot.Weak a.c.. Nice car and runs good but get a loaded limited..
"06 10, 2015",Rav4,"Love my new Rav4. I've only had it a week, but I can tell you, I feel safe in it and secure with my decision in purchasing one. Toyota's are dependable, safe and they hold their value for years to come. I would recommend one to anybody. Great car!"
"03 11, 2014",The most valuable small SUV,"I purchased 2012 Sport V4 model to replace 2005 Sienna Van. I rented a Hyundi Santa Fe for roadtrip before my purchsing. I also tested Nissan Rouge and Honda CRV. Rav4 and Honda CRV were on the final run. I choice Toyota because the package met my need for the price that I expected.

Less than one year later, my wife purchased the 2013 CRV base model.

Now, I can tell you the true experience of these two competitors as the user.

They both have same performance.

Rav4 2012 is the last year of the old model. Its interior was designed for V6 w/7 seat optiopn. The 2nd row seat can be slided back and forth. My 5 seat get extra leg room when I push back. Because mine is 5 seat model. It has X-extra huge cargo space. Put down the 2nd row seat, I can still get a flat space like a bed when I going out for camping like driving Sienna van. The 6 speakers audio has excellent sound quality. The only Con's for this car from my experience are 2:
1. The doors are very light, so most of times I have push a little when closing the door.
2. The gas tank is only 12 gal. I believe this is a compromise for the other X-extra features for 7 seat option. I believe this has been changed to 16 gal. in 2013 new model. Of cause, you will not get those X-extra space from 2013 model.
My Sport model come with roof window, rack, buletooth and MP3, USB and back-up camera.
I used to buy long lumbers from HomeDepot when I drove Sienna van. Although Rav4 is not as long as Sienna van , I can still buy plenty of 2x6x(8+ size). My Rav4 Sport model has #3 gear which help picking up speed on highway when I need.

Honda has better interior (roomy). The windshield was pushed forward with wider glass to get more space. The interior width is also a little wider than Rav4. The driver's seat has arm rest which is good for long trip. The back-up camera(rear monitor) has become standard feature which is very thoughtful for high position vehicle. The cargo space is huge too. CRV has smaller turning radious for you make U-turn.

They both make you feel very steady while driving on the curving road. They both very reliable, comfort, good driver's view to all around the traffic. The price is difficult to compare each other. I will think they are pretty much the same if same features, but unfortuantely their different trims equipted with different features.

Toyota Rav4 (even though 2013 model) is a little sporty looking while CRV is more like city car. You shall pick what you need. You will like either one. Both Toyota and Honda make good value products.

So far, I have 10500 miles on my Rav4 and over 5000 miles on CRV.

My Rav4 perform 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the roadtrip with premium gas.

My wife has never counted the mpg for her CRV. I think it is about the same in city. I guess the roadtrip mpg shall be a little better if we try Eco-mode. She mentioned one time about Eco-mode and said ""You don't want use this feature in the town even though on highway because the system will run with less power."" I guess that Eco-mode will be very helpful if we go for roadtrip in Wild West.

Hope these true experience are helpful for you."
"01 24, 2014",Great buy,"We really like this car! Got it because we're expecting a baby and wNt something reliable and functional. We got it from Maguire Toyota in Ithaca, NY, and Bridget helped us. She was fantastic- never pressured us, just showed us everything we wanted to see, gave us more information, and answered all our questions. We'll be going back there for our next vehicle purchase,"
"11 25, 2013","Like the car, but. . .","RAV is a good choice, generally. Can't beat it for dependability, resale, etc. Not very exciting in the interior, although it's OK. I like the external spare, but that's going away, along with leather seat covers and V6 power. Uses tons of fuel, but that's true with the smaller engine as well."
"09  8, 2013","Very good on gas milage, reliable and beautiful.","Very good on gas milage.
Nice,cozy interior and beautifully crafted exterior.
Spacious trunk for shopping and for reasonable haulage.
Easily accessible driving features and equiped with some modern car technology. Loving It."
"07 28, 2013",Loving it!,"Looks great, drives great. I bought it for the AWD feature for winter driving. I'm happy it will have the power when I need it, and has great gas mileage."
"07 22, 2013",My Dream UV I Never Knew!,"I am amazed at the comfort and security this vehicle gives me once I get behind the wheel. The difference in the gas mileage expenditure has improved from day one. I love the GPS feature and Blue tooth, which have come in so handy for me with my kids/family/co-workers! I love my Rav4! THANKS JESSE!!"
"03  7, 2013",great car!,The seller and finance personnel were all very helpful and proffessional. But best of all i got the best deal in the market! I love my new toyota rav4!!!
"02 28, 2013",AWESOME!,"We just love this vehicle! Within 15 minutes of purchasing I was traveling 300 miles. It rode smoothly, I feel safe in it, comfy...simple WE LOVE IT!"
"02 23, 2013",like the v6 power. Goooooo,"I have a 2007 Rav4 and use it for travel. The V6 give you the option of getting out of the way or hitting the brakes. the interstates are test of survival. So when I found out that toyota was getting rid of the V6 safety feature, I purchased the 2012 with the V6. Now the 2013 Rav4 looks like all the rest. Oh hum"
"01 29, 2013",Mitsubishi,"Happy with car after purchase. There is nothing more to say than, what a nice car. It was the cae that caught my eye on the road"
"01 24, 2013",Found a great car at a great price,"Haven't had it long enough to really tell yet, but so far, I am more than satisfied. The ride is a little stiff. The gas mileage has been better than expected."
"01 22, 2013",Great Solid Driver,"Drove them all found the Rav 4 to be the most solid feeling Cross over in it's class. Nice feel on the hi-way, great brakes, comfortable firm but not harsh ride."
"01 17, 2013",Bought Toyotas since 1976,"We've bought Toyotas since we were married in 1976. We have found them to be very realiable. We're had corolla, camrays, Supra, Thundra, other trucks, and this is my second Rav 4"
"01 15, 2013",Outstanding buying expierence!,"As a long term West Herr customer, I recently referred a friend to ""Casey Mac Alpine"" at West Herr Toyota of Williamsville. Just wanted to express the great customer service that my friend received from ""Casey""which was ""Class A all the way. She mentioned that this was the best car buying experience that she has ever had in the many years of dealing with sales people. She felt that the he listened and cared!"
"01 14, 2013",Fun little in-town car,"Fun to drive, Not a luxury car, nice little commuter that holds a lot. Great on gas. I use the Rav4 to get to and from work about 5 miles each way. I also have horses and need to hall feed from time to time and this little SUV does it all. Recently put 10 bags of shavings in it with no trouble at all. I needed a car with good gas mileage and could hall feed, and large dogs. This Rav4 seems to do it all with ease. So far I love it. Don't think i would like it on a long trip."
"01  9, 2013",best suv,looks great feels good great ride. Has many extra's and toyota is big on all the small details and extras
"01  6, 2013",Worst experience,"First off, my family has always owned a Toyota and NEVER ever had problems. We were always satisfied by how reliable the quality of Toyota vehicles were.

With an almost 1 yr old and me being pregnant, my husband and I decided we needed to buy a brand new car. He wanted a Ford or Jeep, but I insisted on Toyota. I did so much research and showed him all the great consumer and expert reviews on the Rav4. He finally caved in and we bought a brand new 2012 Rav4.

We got it in August 2012 and loved it! But then 3 months later (1,200 mileage only) in November (we live in the UK by the way, stationed in England), it broke down on me and my daughter at night in the cold. We were stuck for 1.5hr trying to get help and then finally a friend was able to get us but he tried to drive it too, and it broke down on him too. I know my prego hormones were out of wack, but it was awful and my daughter was crying hysterically by the way. We were cold and scared!

My husband tried to drive it to the Cambridge Toyota center but it broke down on him too and he had to wait 4hrs and 40 mins for someone to tow it to the dealership.

Then it took almost 2 weeks to figure out what was wrong with it. My husband who was deploying the following week at first was asking friends for rides to his deployment appointments and briefings, but since it was taking longer than expected we had to rent a car (which is not covered by warranty). It was just the worst timing ever.

The fuel pump pressure was defective. Warranty covered it and is ""fixed"" they say, but apparently it is still causing problems because our neighbors who are currently watching the car for us (they'll be watching it for about 6 months) says it still runs when they drive it, but it feels like it might stall at stops. It hasn't stalled yet, but STILL, what safety is that?!

Sorry Toyota, this experience totally made me never want to own one, and not only do I feel betrayed by Toyota's reliable past, I also feel like I disrespected my husband by not considering the Ford or Jeep he wanted. Should have just listened to him and trusted him!

Totally disappointed and not looking forward to going back to the UK to drive a potentially hazardous car for our family."
"12 20, 2012",G-Man,"This is the third Rav4 I've owned. They never disappoint. Excellent performance, comfort, and very
reliable. Seventy cubic feet of cargo space, comes in
handy, on many occasions. Living in New England, the
Rav4, enables you to drive in any condition, with confidence. I've had a direct influence on six friends,
who also purchased Rav4's."
"12 19, 2012",RECOMMEND TO ALL,"CAN'T GET ANY BETTER, RECOMMEND TO ALL.PERFECT SO EASY TO DRIVE, WARRENTY IS GREAT, MAINTANCE IS EXCELLENT."
"12 10, 2012",Excellent!,"Best car I've ever owned ... I traded a 2009 RAV4 for my 2012! Great mileage, comfort, style, perfect for toting my amps and guitars to gigs. Love it!"
"10 31, 2012",RAV,"This is the fourth Toyota in our household and my second RAV4. My first RAV4 was 12yrs old, and I loved it. The only reason I sold it was to get the down payment to buy a newer one. I got a great price when I sold my 2001 RAV4 - had I been able to keep the old one and still buy the new one, I would have b/c I LOVE my RAVs!"
"10 26, 2012",Excellent little car,Care has plenty of pep and get-up-and-go for a 4-cylinder engine. The handling is superb. Very pleased with leg room. Good dependable care for the money. Would recommend to a friend
"10 22, 2012",The RAV4 Sport,"Fabulous vehicle, way more room than the Honda CR-V! Strongly influenced by owning a 2003 Matrix for 8 years! Durable, long lasting, and reliable! Never doubted the vehicle for a second! I am very happy about my Dad's advice and gearing me towards a RAV4 Sport! Absolutely outstanding. My husband jokingly and lovingly says; ""All you ever do is have a nicer car than your husband!""

Love it!"
"10 17, 2012",Very comfortable,"I'm 6'4"" with arthritis in knees and hips. The RAV4 allows me to travel for more than 1 1/2 hrs before I need to stop to relieve knee and hip pain. There is also more than ample headroom."
"09 28, 2012",Need more seat time to be totally objective,"Great mid size SUV.
Good Fuel economy.
Great Ride with good cornering stability.
Toyo Open country tires noisy on some furfaces."
"09 23, 2012",Safe and Reliable Small SUV,"This is the second RAV4 we have owned. It is a nice little SUV for our needs, we purchased for reliability and the value we got for the money. Very easy to drive and has all the safety features you need in a modern vehicle including the backup camera. Plenty of room in the back for all our stuff and a Kayak on top of the racks. Plus my wife likes how the higher stance of the vehicle gives her a better view of the road. The RAV4 fits our lifestyle and needs."
"09 21, 2012",32 mpg on hwy,"minimum 28 mpg through yellowstone, tetons,rockies. almost drives itself.only a four cylinder but plenty power."
"09 10, 2012",Just another car,"It is an okay car, if my Honda was not totaled I would not have bought this. According to the on car mpg gauge we are only getting 21 mpg."
"08 24, 2012",Rav4 Review,"Stylish , Innovative, Contemporary Toyota Moving Forward! Vast Improvement over last years mOdel, no recalls yet?"
"08 24, 2012",My New Rav 4,"I've been a Toyota person forever. Prior to this SUV, I had a Yaris - which is fantastic on gas. I needed a vehicle for the snow, plus a larger one for my dogs. I absolutely love my SUV, roomy enough, and it sits high enough (like a truck) so I can see past the vehicle ahead of me. It rides so smootlhly and I can't wait to use all the gadgets I've never had before in a car. For a larger vehicle that I am used to - it is doing exceptionally well on gas. (I average 26.5 mpg) This is in the city - mind you. This is also the first vehicle I've had which is automatic. I have to remind myself not to shift & not to clutch. Other than this, I love my new Rav-ioli."
"08 23, 2012",Better than govt. motors,Got tired of poor quality of gm dealers. Tired of their shoddy service and excuses. Bought Toyota. Best personal service of dealers and sales. Most courteous and genuine. WONT GO BACK TO GM.
"08 23, 2012",Raving over the Rav 4,"It took me a long time to settle on and buy exactly what I wanted. The Toyota Rav 4 Sport V6. It's fun to drive, surprisingly quick and responsive, looks amazing (sport w/appearance package) and toyota's reliability is bar none. I wish that they offered navigation systems in the other models besides the limited, but I'll just have to use the maps on my smart phone. Great all round, 4 seasons car."
"08 21, 2012",love my suv,It is what I wanted and thank the dealer for making it possible. Love the way it drives and the way it looks.
"08 14, 2012",RAV4 SPORT RED,"I bought RAV4 Sport, ride is awful and the back seat is really tight and bumpy... if you driving by yourself, I guess it?s O.K.. it?s not good for family ride. First couple of years I use to get good gas mileage, then it?s drop to around 17-19 miles? I change oil every 3k, even though MFG. recommended at 5K. If I wait till 5K there won't be any oil to change, it burn about 1-1/2 QT every 1000 miles? AWFUL. I took 3 times to the dealer to fix, but they said it's normal. What I am hearing and reading almost all the TOYOTA cars are BURNING OIL like crazy. Now I just add oil every other month, seems like I made a big mistake buying the RAV4,, after 4-recall I think I am done with TOYOTA!!"
"07 12, 2012",Must have,I love this car and the stylish new look. I have the sport and it's a beautiful SUV. Must have........
"06 29, 2012",now a two rav4 family,the 97 rav 4 is sweet with no problems other than normal service which is expected so we added a new one to the family which is the 2012 rav4 limited and passed on the 4 wheel drive and 6 cylinder as we live in Florida and wanted the best millage and did not have the need for a 6 or 4x4 as our new 2012 rav has more power than the 97 which is fine everywhere fully loaded with camp equipment except for going up mountains where I could not even meet the 55 mph speed limit so expect the new rav to hanndle that even better
"05  6, 2012",2nd Toyota SUV - after Chevys and Benzs...,"Since last few weeks I am enjoying my new 2012 Toyota RAV4 Sport 4WD, it is really a nice vehicle.
Bluetooth works great, Fuel wise is also very echonomical, drive smooth."
"04 19, 2012",2nd RAV 4 I've Owned,"This is the 2nd RAV 4 I've Owned. Traded in a 2002 Model RAV 4 for the 2012 Model. It's quite different and I still love it. It's larger, roomier and still great to handle. I especially like the roomier back seat and the larger cargo area. Looked at some competitor's vehicles but came back to the RAV 4 mostly for the reliability and great value."
"04 16, 2012",My Rav,"This is the best car i ever own, I always wanted it. If I didnt get it I woudnt feel right. When you really want something you have to go for it!!"
"04 12, 2012",Love it so far,"I just got my 2012 Rav4 a few weeks ago and took it on a 14 hours round trip to Virginia with no problems. I averaged 25mpg- not awesome but I'll take it. It was very car-like and easy to handle and also very comfortable. Visibility was fine. You do have to watch for wind - common with taller cars but I was driving a tiny sedan previously so it was not something I was used to right away. I love the bluetooth capability and the controls on the dash - something I did not really think I would care about. Since I went from CNY (40 degrees) to Va (65 degrees) I got to use both heat and a/c: both were fine. Lots of storage space throughout. My friend just traded in her 12 year old Rav 4 with over 140,000mi on it. I hope mine lasts that long!"
"11  4, 2023",The RAV4 is the best running car I’ve ever had.,I love my 2013 RAV4. It runs great. I haven’t had any problems with it. The key is to always keep up the maintenance  Toyota makes the best cars.
"03  5, 2023",2013 Rav4,"Car is very reliable, i have had it almost 10 years. It has 155,000 mi
Have replaced the normal things like brakes and tires. It has a stiff ride, changed shocks and struts and still stiff. which is the #1 disappointment. Between 45 and 55 it has a bad vibration.."
"11 25, 2022",Terrible handling/ride,Worst ride ever. CD player had to be repaired. Battery needed to be installed. Dealership held back on providing problems. Probably my fault for not asking. Just relied on the  Toyota name. Headlights  were foggy and should have been improved .Defect in left front fender. Needed a wheel alignment. I could go on. I was the fool.
"09  9, 2022",I had to replace bulbs several times.,"2013 RAV4 I bought this small SUV with 25,000 miles. This car is Mexico/Canada build. I am gonna keep it short when this car passed the 105,000 miles started to fall apart( literally). The car is “affordable “ because it is built with cheap parts, and replacement are very expensive. I had to replace shock absorbers, many lights, and TRANSMISSION."
"04  5, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable,"Interior and exterior appearance are just perfect. It has plenty of power and provides a smooth ride in any weather condition.
We have owned this car for 4 years and will keep it for another 4 years at least."
"12 14, 2020",Glad to be back in a Toyota.,We had an older RAV4 and when looking for another vehicle knew we wanted to check out something newer.   Toyota has door a good job in updating the look and comfort without compromising the performance.   Happy to have given another RAV4 a home.
"09  4, 2020",The nicest comfortable vehicle so far,"this car meets all I  need in a vehicle, roomy, comfortable , allot of power, and not to complicated. great handling car , smooth ride. I would buy another."
"08 16, 2020",Reliable Small SUV,"We have 50,000 miles on this car.    So far no defects.    Fabric seats hard to clean.  We get 24 city and 28 highway mpg from the base 4 cylinder engine.   A bit noisy on long trips."
"05 30, 2020",Not a car for comfort or room,"This car is extremely uncomfortable, very stiff over bumps. It doesn't have a lot of room inside and nothing makes sense to me. It's just too bad because Toyota has always been one of my favorite vehicles. But they really did a horrible job on this one. I would never get a rav 4 again after that."
"05 24, 2020","Safe, durable reliable.","The Rav-4 is a great SUV for folks who have long winter commutes. The safety features just keep getting better and that truly matters. You can expect to put 300,00 miles on the speedometer with very few repairs."
"05 19, 2020",Beautiful car,"This car exceeds my expectations so far.  Rides beautifully, quiet, and smooth.  Definitely enjoy driving this vehicle.  Good gas mileage and a good solid, reliable car that comes highly recommended by my mechanic."
"05 18, 2020",Love the car,Haven't driven it long but so far I love it. It's comfortable and drives great. I like the compact look but still is roomy inside.
"04 22, 2020",Overall Great Car,"This was the first car I have purchased. A limited edition Toyota RAV4. It has leather seats, sunroof, and is a beautiful cherry red color. I love everything about this car but I wish the screen inside the car looked a little more updated. But can't be too picky considering it is a 2013. I am love with this car. Also drives very smoothly and has good pick me up. Would recommend this car to anyone."
"03 30, 2020",It is exactly the right car for me.,"This car is easy for me to get in and out of.  It suits my needs, is easy to park, and has been so reliable.  I've received many compliments on it since it was new, even from strangers in the grocery store parking lot."
"03 23, 2020",reliable and dependable car,"the suv meet the need of my daughter day to day commute from home to work and to do some run around.i will highly recommed this suv to any one that need a reliable car, economy and fuel efficient."
"03 22, 2020",Gray Phantom,"I thoroughly enjoy this car. It's comfortable, easy to drive, dependable, sporty, carries everything I need or want, and also carries the Thule cargo carrier on top fully loaded."
"01  9, 2020",Transmission issues,"Transmission failed after 96,000 miles. New transmission installed and slipping after 16,000 miles with torque converter shuddering. Every mechanic i knew said get a Toyota, they're soooo reliable. Now idk what to get. This makes me so suspicious of every car I look at."
"11 19, 2019",More then I hoped for!,"Was looking for SUV/AWD/Navigation.  Got more then that!!!  Limited and Loaded 
Feels so awesome driving my new Toyota RAV4
Thank you Blaise Alexander Subaru of Williamsport"
"11  2, 2019",Good city car,City car for convenience. Reliable transportation. Not a highway car. Lacking the smooth ride due to light weight and under power. I should have bought the Highlander. The wife loves the ease of parking.
"10 21, 2019",I’m not sure,My car kinda shift gears or jerk can’t really explain it but it does that if I’m driving under 40mph. Not sure what’s wrong with it hope my transmission isn’t slipping. I have a friend who has the same exact one but hers 2 years newer mines a 2013 and hers does the same thing.
"09 14, 2019",First time I have ever Owned a Toyota,First time ever owning a Toyota SUV I really like the vehicle if you’re looking for an SUV Toyota RAV4 is really a nice ride
"08 19, 2019",Fun to drive!,"I wasn’t sold on this vehicle at first but after a few days I grew to love it! It’s super fun to drive & has most of the features I want in a vehicle. The front and back are super roomy...my bf who’s 6’ tall fits extremely well & comfortably in both the front & back of the vehicle. It has a great ride & gets good mpg. I would have given it 5 stars BUT this vehicle lacks a few very important features...ones I didn’t think to ask about because quite frankly I just assumed every vehicle had it these days. My bad! What it doesn’t have is air conditioning vents in the back of the suv! Say what!? I know...I was quite shocked to discover this as I was driving my kids around on a hot day...the vent in the dash...which the right half of is fake and doesn’t work...is supposed to cool off the back of the vehicle. Why oh why would anyone ever design a vehicle to not have a/c vents for the backseat passengers??? Another key feature it doesn’t have is remote start, however, some will have that...but don’t be like me & think it’s standard because it’s not & now I have to pay to have an after market remote start installed. Ugh. One last thing I don’t like & honestly thought no vehicle had anymore is a lever inside the vehicle on the floor alongside the drivers seat that you have to press to open the gas tank. Let’s just say the first time I stopped for gas was quite the experience. It took me a few to figure out how to open the door...sigh. But overall it’s a good vehicle."
"08 11, 2019",Boring but reliable,"Very very reliable, no issues at all. Engine is underpowered, but good all wheel drive system and roomy interior. Good value for the money if you don’t care about engine performance"
"07 23, 2019",Great Value RAV4,"This car was a good in all weather, reliable, and well put together.  It performed new as it did 7 years later.  Toyota quality is apparent."
"07 16, 2019",good family suv,"rides good, looks good, goes great in the snow.  small suv small but big with lots of room.   the dealship wait area is clean with lots of chairs, popcorn and ice cold bottle water.  a play area for the little ones.  all family members are welcome."
"05 20, 2019",Most reliable car I've ever owned.,Great all around vehicle. Very roomy and great gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4. They're just really well built and reliable. I love Rav 4's.
"05 13, 2019",WIFE'S NEW CAR,"WIFE LOVES THIS CAR! SHE REPLACED HER LEXUS IS250 WHICH WAS A GREAT CAR. I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD MISS HER LEXUS, BUT LIKES THIS CAR BETTER - MORE VISIBILITY, SIMILAR POWER, MORE REAR SEAT LEGROOM."
"04 29, 2019","Reliable, Economical",Good visibility for the driver.  A little noisy.   Zero problems.   I have 45000 miles on it.  It would be better with fabrics that would be easier to clean.
"04 21, 2019",I had a 2008 rav4 bought it used,"Bought a used 2008 Toyota RAV4 in 2010 with 50000 miles on it drove to 160000 miles on it. It is by far the best and trouble free suv I have ever owned. Never did It leave me stranded on the road although I got stuck in a storm in buffalo and couldn’t see a thing , this suv drove me to the hotel with inches of snow. If it was any other suv I would have probably been stranded on the highway. Overall all the years of owning just did oil changes and routine Maintainance. Sometimes did oil changes after 7000 miles and car just ran forever. In deep snow the all wheel drive system is not the best but I used snow tires and never really had a problem. Way to go rav4 it’s the best car."
"04  9, 2019",The most reliable vehicle I've ever owned! LOVE!!,"Friends & family love this car! Drives like  8 cylinder, luxurious ride,  and plenty of room for passengers, luggage, etc.  I love driving this gem!"
"03 29, 2019",Recommend or Not Recommend,"So far so Good. This car has room for my legs and plenty of power for a 4 cyl.
It drives nice and has a smooth comfort ride to it."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota Dependability 5 stars,"Purchased a used 2013 awd Rv4 limited with 43K,now has 55K,not 1 issue,AWD great for our winters in Buffalo,peppy enuf,decent gas mileage,handles well,comfortable ride for a small suv,has all the amenities,2 minor Quips,the info screen is useless in sunlight,cant see the info at all,and,for a top of the line limited the door lock switches,window switches etc are not lit at night,come on toyota talk about cheaping out,all in all a great vehicle."
"02 17, 2019",Another great example of a high quality Toyota,"Excellent value and utility in a variety of uses

Very reliable  and stable on the road

Huge amount of flexible space 

My second RAV- drove the prior one for 9 years and over 90000 miles"
"02 16, 2019",Toyota Blizxard Pearl paint chips!  Buyer BEWARE,"I love my car.  However the paint is peeling like crazy. Toyota knows of the issue and refuses to do anything about it. Research the paint before you buy. I cannot even have my car detailed without losing huge chunks of paint! Blizzard Pearl Paint cannot even stick to the primer, the entire car has to be stripped, sanded, and painted with different everything.  #Toyotapaintpeels"
"01 31, 2019",Nice car,Very nice car.  It is very comfortable.  I am impressed with the ride quality.  The heater worked wonderfully.  Visibility is fantastic.  I am happy with the safety rating of the car as well.
"01 24, 2019",Good car for the money,My only complaint is too much road noise.  Good mileage. Great handling in any weather conditions.  Wonderful dealership.  Have had no problems other than  only needed a new battery after 5 years
"12  1, 2018","I liked the RAV4 so much, I bought it.","I drove a hr to test drive a Toyota RAV4. I liked it so much, I ended up buying it. It was definitely worth it."
"11 22, 2018",very reliable,"My second Rav4. Very reliable, economical, tons of room in the back. Peppy, reasonably quiet, shifts like a dream and will tow my 15' A-liner trailer!"
"11 20, 2018",Most reliable car ever .,"This car is comfortable and friendly for owner.Is very fast , light and nice .to driver.I can recommend these car for all futures  buyers.
I love him."
"11 17, 2018",Great all around car!,"This car is great for so many different situations that you need it for. It holds 5 people, cabin is very roomy(more than my old midsize suv), gets good fuel economy, and is reliable. The base sound system is amazing considering it isn?t upgraded or anything. It could have a little more power on the highway but otherwise performance is good and ride comfort is fine. It?s just a good average all around suv."
"11 13, 2018",Finally a Toyota Owner and I could not be happier!,"I had a small SUV for a few years that turned out to be a lemon and was on the hunt for a new or used small SUV. My family has long been a fan of Toyotas but I've never owned one. After lengthy research by myself and my husband we found a great price on a used RAV4 and went for a test drive. I was skeptical about having a 4 cylinder vehicle again after years of driving an Accord but I was super impressed with the way the RAV4 drove. I love the safety features (blind spot monitor, back up camera and side curtain airbags) and since I have the Limited package the leather and upgraded stereo made the car even more appealing. I've been averaging around 27mpg which is 6 better than my old car and really enjoy driving again. I have a 35 minute commute to work one way and this small SUV has been great. I'm anxious to see how it fares with an Ohio winter. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone looking to purchase a small SUV. It has a real transmission (unlike many other in its class) and the safety features are top notch."
"11  7, 2018",Good car,Nice vehicle. 4 cyl is surprisingly sprightly for a naturally aspirated engine. AWD in a small SUV was just what I needed. Should be reliable.
"10 28, 2018",Awesome Car,"Great vehicle, service records were available. Salesman Steve Groves was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. Great sales team & showroom. Service folks were nice as well."
"10 10, 2018",Very happy with the Toyota Rav4.,"Excellant warranty.   Covered tourque converter even though the veh.
was several months past the 5 yr warranty.   That was the only problem that I ever had with the veh.  Very dependable;  comfortable, and great gas milage.   Just bought a new 2018 Toyota Rav5 to replace this one."
"10  5, 2018",Reliable & versatile,"We have owned all Toyota models (except carolla).
They, over the years have proven to be extremely reliable, long lasting & have great resale value. 
After owning a 1995 RAV, 2013 Redesign appears to be larger than older models. Ride & seats are very comfortable."
"07 25, 2018",Amazing Car for a Reasonable Price,Wanted a reliable car that was perfect for all the seasons that Colorado has to offer and my Rav4 is a perfect fit. A sleek interior and bluetooth radio lets your drive in style.
"07 10, 2018","Comfortable, Economical and Reliable!","Happy first time Toyota RAV4 owner. Reliable in any weather. Reasonably comfortable, economical on gas. Spacious, easy for passengers + cargo. Disappointed 2013 NO COMPASS!!!"
"07  2, 2018",Rav 4,"The car met all my needs for safety, economical, good value and good price. I would highly recommend this model to my friends and family."
"06 30, 2018",Most reliable car I own I give my RAV4,"This car has great leg room in the back seat and the front too the parking is better, runn perfect , love the stereo system"
"06 30, 2018",I love this suv is  great to drive and parking ?,"This car has camera for parking , blue tooth, great stereo system economy and gas right great ? I love my RAV4 I am happy ?"
"05 25, 2018",Best investment for me!,This car has been great for me though any kind of weather. The interior is super comfy and spacious. The exterior is very sharp to the eye! Most of all it?s rated super safe!
"05 11, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"We have always had great luck with Toyota vehicles: Camry and RAV 4.
Internet Auto Brokers wrote into the contract that we could have the car checked with our choice of mechanics and our trusted garage gave its blessing."
"05  3, 2018",Love my car,The car is amazing. I love how it drives . It?s comfortable and overall better on gas . I love how it feels like a car but is and suv
"04 28, 2018",My dream Car,"The Car is in excellent shape and no matter the rudeness of dealership, I'm  still in love the car. I am coming from driving a Honda CRV and wanted to try Toyota. Love the RAV4 better"
"03 30, 2018",Love it,"I've had it for almost 5 years now, and still really enjoy it. Over-all, most reliable car I've ever owned.  Other than a cracked front window from a stone chip, the only think I've done on this car is oil changes. Built so well!"
"03 23, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"This car is perfect for me.  I'm short and not all cars fit very well for short people.. But this rav4 is great.. Wonderful gas milage,  very comfortable,  and roomie my husband is tall and it works for him too..."
"03 16, 2018",Great affordable car i purchase,I fell inlove with this car. Its very comfortable and very economic. It drives so smooth and very spacious inside. It feels like brand new car.
"02 25, 2018",Mister,Sporty and roomy and has some spunk love the blue tooth feature. I like the backup camera and all the room in the back for storage.
"02 15, 2018",I love the reliabilty of toyota,"It's good looking and also excellent on gas. I love how it zipps around town, it's so easy to drive and park and I know it will last for years to come!"
"01 29, 2018",Like driving chocolate. Smooth and silky.,"I have been driving a Subaru for the last few years I loved it, but wanted a small SUV that sat a little higher and had less miles. I found my 2013 Toyota Rav4  on car gurus. I love it!. The exterior styling is sleek and inside, luxurious. The back up camera is so helpful, as is the Bluetooth. And who doesn't love a moon roof!!. I'm looking forward to many adventures in my new Toyota."
"01 13, 2018",Love my Rav!!,This SUV is great. I love the all wheel drive and my back seat bench seating. The back seat is adjustable for you to lay back which is awesome! Lots of trunk space. I've had my 2013 RAV4 limited for 5 years
"01  8, 2018","This is my 2nd RAV4, both bought new.",My title says it all... it's one of my best investment made. Best value for the money and reliability and quality.
"12 10, 2017",My favorite Car of ALL Time,"I love my Rav4. The car far exceeds my expectations and the mileage advertised by Toyota. On my recent trip to Atlantic City, I was able to get well over 35 mpg on straight highway driving. I have plenty of room in the trunk for my folding bike plus luggage. The seating is comfortable and the way they are designed, they hold you on sharp curves."
"12  1, 2017",Good car,"The car has met my needs, but I preferred my Mitsubishi Outlander for perks. It drives well, but I had to replace tires at under 30,000 miles and warranty had just expired because it was already over 3 years old."
"11 27, 2017",Love the exterior of our Rav 4,We love our Rav 4 lots of room like all the extras included in our purchase we have always owned a Toyota  along with our grown children who also own Toyotas.
"11 21, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"This is my second RAV4, you can't go wrong with them... Toyota makes a good product and although you're going to pay more upfront, in the long run you'll have saved as maintenance is minimal cause they're built to last. I spent next to nothing in my last one compared to some and I had it a little over 10 yrs. Great Mid size SUV, sporty and fun to drive, absolutely love mine."
"11 15, 2017",Crashed,"I was T boned directly into the drivers door/front tire from a CRV traveling over 55mph.  Every airbag deployed as I spun multiple times, ending up off the road down in a field.  I climbed out of the passengers side with only a limp.  I am thankful every safety feature of this Toyota protected me."
"11  4, 2017",$2 BILL,Fun driving spacious vehicle where I can carry bowling xxxxx and golf clubs without having to take one or the out of the car...
"10 22, 2017",The best car I have owned,"Toyota's are my favorite male of cars. My first was a Camry that went far beyond 200k miles. My favorite model years ago was my Avalon, again going over 200 k miles. My next car was Camry which at 200k mi was given to a young couple needing a car 2 years ago and it is still a smooth ride. I now own the BEST car I have ever owned, a Rav4. I bought a 2013 fully loaded car 1 1/2 yrs ago.  It is great on gas. It drives smoothly and the all wheel drive was exceptional last winter."
"10 22, 2017",Most comfortable and reliable car I've owned.,"This car makes hauling anything very easy. Very spacious, and comfortable to ride in. This car has been extremely reliable since the day I got it. I have a 45 minute commute to work every day and this car makes the time fly by with its AUX chord plug in option, and smooth riding experience."
"10 18, 2017",Most super performance car I owned,"This is my first car ever and never regretted my decision of buying it. Its very comfortable, good mileage, less maintenance issues and great for long drives. Never got a back pain even with ling drives and hill drives."
"09 26, 2017",RAV4 is an awesome ride!,All around great SUV. Superbly spacious & ride is smooth. Great on gas mileage as well. Love my RAV4.
"09 12, 2017",Best All Around Car!,"This vehicle is stylish, fun to drive, great gas mileage.  I've owned all kinds of cars, I never thought a Toyota would meet all my needs and then some.   I liked it so much I got one for our Daughter.  I absolutely love this car!"
"08 23, 2017",This is my first Toyota and I love it!!,I love the RAV4 and how it handles! There's nothing I don't like about it! I will always and forever buy Toyotas from now on!
"08 17, 2017",Is the best and most reliable vehicle ever,"These has met all my needs, its easy to transport my family,entertainment is enhanced,it is cormfotable in terms of seats,wheels are okay and more other features."
"08  7, 2017",Beautiful on the outside; could use more on the in,Looks great; drives well. Can't get past the fact the fact that this car does not have a bin for my sunglasses inside. Bought this after owning a 2006 Sienna XLE Limited and am disappointed that the 2013 RAV4 is not even half as luxurious as concerns inside storage space and smooth ride
"08  2, 2017","dependable, great for an SUV, just not what I want","I purchased this SUV w the thoughts of needing cargo space .... practicality, but my heart is in need of a convertible w some punch..... prev owned toyota convertible, the back up camera in my Rav & bluetooth are both great extras, sharp but seems this model is similar to several other SUVs produced @ this time, would like better if had unique look separating from others designs overall though drives well & is dependable.... Toyota does seem to offer more ""extras"" for the $ also"
"07 16, 2017",Extremely Reliable Care!,"The Toyota Rav4 is an exceptional car for my money. The 2.5L DOHC 4 Cyl Engine puts out a healthy 275hp and 172lb-ft of torque. Plenty of pep as well as great gas mileage. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! If you're looking a great crossover SUV, put this one on your list to test drive."
"07 10, 2017",Great Mid-Size Car,"Bought this car just before starting our family.  We really wanted something safe, reliable, and had a good amount of space without being too big.  This fit the bill, we love this Rav4!  It also does great in snow and off road which is a good plus for us."
"07  9, 2017",RAV4 super car,"WOW.... This is one gorgeous RAV.... Loaded with features and options, backed by Toyota, this is a must have. Not only is the color amazing, the ride is awesome, and the comfort is top notch"
"07  6, 2017",Reliable and Efficient Car,"I used to drive Sedan, and getting into SUV has given me a what I was looking for, specifically more space for my children which served as family car for short and long trips."
"06 29, 2017",Very good on gas and very comfortable.,Love the color of interior. Best comfort on our trips we have taken. 28-30 miles to gallon on trips. I would buy another one when needed.
"06 28, 2017",Great pickup for a 4 cylinder,"I bought this 2013 vehicle new, currently have 64k miles on it, and have enjoyed driving it. It has great pickup, which helps in quick passing in tight spots. It is comfy (of course I'm not a tall/big person). I've had to date no major service issues."
"06 11, 2017",Comfortable ride!,"I really liked my Toyota Rav4. It was a great size for someone who doesn't love large SUV's but wants some cargo space, or has a family. The car was very reliable, and drove awesome. I did feel like it had some slight issues in snow (after further research realized it was probably just my model) driving, and heavy rain. The weight distribution was slightly off, and the back end would slide slightly. Still loved the car, and would totally recommend!"
"06  5, 2017",Is my 2nd Toyota.  They do it right.,"When I test drove this previously owned SUV, I realized there have been many advances in features I have missed.  My Rav 4 is such a pleasure to drive."
"06  1, 2017",Cant recommend it,"I bought this RAV4 to replace my F150. I had F150s for over 20 yrs and they just got too big for my needs, enter the RAV. The car did everything I wanted except for the comfort of the seats, after 20 mins I would get pain in the back of my legs regardless of how I positioned the seat, I could vary it a bit but never eliminate the pain and discomfort. I put 25,000 miles a year on this car so I can speak with good authority on these below average seats. It doesn't present in the test drive but on longer drives its torture. The F-150s are all day long comfortable as is the Subaru Outback that replaced this RAV4. Toyota made a nice vehicle with the RAV that suits the needs of many consumers but failed in the driver/car interface in epic fashion. The Nissan Murano outclasses the RAV by light years in seat comfort.  BEWARE if you are shopping a RAV4 try a Nissan, Subaru... see how the seat feels and think long and hard before getting that RAV. Other than that it was very good in all other areas but lets face it, if you dread even short trips in your car it doesn't matter what else it does, it has to meet a minimum comfort level and the RAV 4 does not, not even close."
"05 16, 2017",Best vehicle purchase ever!,"I only wished I'd gotten remote open/close on the door of the storage area. Seats let down for more storage space and when I open my sunroof, I'm in a sports vehicle. The sound system is awesome. I'm not a soccer mom, just like the room and the idea of having space for everything when needed. This is such a cool vehicle to drive, some knee discomfort; and as we all know, Toyota is a mainstay of reliability! One thing, the driver's seat leg room, distance between the seat and the accelerator/brake is a little uncomfortable for me, I try adjusting the seat to different positions but to no avail, smh.  This is causing my right knee to ache, be uncomfortable."
"05  5, 2017",Just what I needed!,"The model I got is not as ""glitzy"" as some SUVs, however, that's really not what I was looking for in a vehicle. I need decent leg room for a tall husband, and the RAV4 provides plenty. Gas mileage is definitely a selling point, as is the reliability typically associated with Toyota. The outside looks impressive and sleek, but I do think that the inside could use a bit more refinement. Turning and overall ride were tight and smooth. It's perfect for carting the family!"
"03 30, 2017",You want one,"The newer rav4 is a great small SUV for everyday use with lots of space for the random times you need it. I love the laws.  I say best small suv, out there and plus it doesn't look like a bubble!"
"03 28, 2017",Toyota Rav 4,"I really really love this vehicle. I went from driving a Nissan Sentra 2003 to a 2013 Rav 4  so this is quite  the upgrade. So far I have no complaints with the car besides a leaking sunroof. I'm not really sure why that is (I haven't looked into yet) but I went for a touchless car wash and the entire front interior of my car got wet. In terms of driving performance, it's a very smooth and comfortable ride. You won't even know when you hit 120 km/h but it does get slightly noisy when you do. In terms of gas, it's not as great as I thought it would be even on eco mode, but it's still quite good. For an SUV it definitely drives like a regular Sports car and doesn't take up space when parking. Overall, I'd say it's one of those vehicles that make you find reasons to drive. :)"
"03 27, 2017",Bought a Rav4,"Great deal, good service from BigM Chevrolet in Radcliff, Ky. 
 Ask for sales rep Tiffany Frizzell."
"03 25, 2017",Great SUV!,"I just bought a 2013 Rav4 Limited a week ago, and I am LOVING it! It is so comfortable and surprisingly roomy. All the safety features are fantastic, I feel like my family is much more protected. It has so many options that make it fun to drive."
"03 22, 2017",I just bought it,"I just bought the car about a week ago. The rear window wiper needed to be replaced (20k miles). Other than that...everything great so far. Very good gas mileage, comfortable ride, lots of space, and drives well in snow"
"03 22, 2017",The newest car i ever owned,i LUV THIS CAR IT DRIVES SO NICE AND IS COMFY. Has alot of gadgets i never knew came on a car. It quite and drives like a dream
"03 21, 2017",Overall very reliable car,Great vehicle Great gas mileage and comfortable interior. It is very good in the winter weather. Dealership always excellent with service.
"03 17, 2017",The car I needed most,I never expect that this car is so big inside. Its a suv that i never expect im gonna get but its good on gas
"03 16, 2017",Dima was Amazing,"I had an amazing experience with Dima. He provided amazing customer service, i loved the service he provided !"
"03 11, 2017",best car ever!,"I love my Rav4, second one I have purchased! Always reliable, they are comfortable, economical and you can use it for almost anything! They are the best!"
"02 18, 2017",Rav Too...,Purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Rav4 Limited and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love this vehicle. Truth be told I sure see a huge difference between this and the 2003 Rav4 L that I previously had. Way bigger way more powerful way more room and tons quieter. Not sure why people complain about noise because mine is ultra quiet. For starters tires are very important. Mine came with noncheap Cooper CS3  all Season Touring tires that are so smooth and quiet and handle great. The design is sexy and upscale. I do agree with those that mention the door extensions and yes they do tend to collect dirt and snow. I really don't let that dampen my spirits. Overall I Really Love my Rav4 Limited. In Silver metallic it's really HOT....
"01 27, 2017",Not what I expected from Toyota,"2013 rav 4 Limited needed a tourque converter with 40,000 miles then a new transmission at 49,000 and still has no pick up. Overall worse purchase of my life! So disappointed and will no longer purchase any type of a Toyota"
"03 26, 2016",Great Reliable Car for the Money!,"We purchased a used 2013 Toyota Rav4 XLE roughly a month ago with about 40,000 miles, and while this vehicle has it's drawbacks in areas, most of them I can live with. My previous vehicle was a 99 Toyota Tacoma with manual transmission. In comparison the Rav4 drives and rides like a dream. I will say that it does have a stiff ride to it, which seems to be a common complaint, but I still find it to be a fairly comfortable overall. I'm mostly a city driver and don't think I would be doing much off-roading with this vehicle. Mostly just wanted something that would handle well in the winter. I love that the rear seats recline, which is a nice feature for passengers in the vehicle. The cars computer system is a little clunky, and the interface could be a little more user friendly. I had a few issues with keeping my phone connected via bluetooth, but a quick internet search and updating the cars firmware quickly resolved those issues. The usb plug and play feature for music is nice. Put your music on a jump drive and play it directly through the audio system. We actually put all our music on an old hard drive we had laying around and plugged it in through a usb cable, so I have my whole library in the car wherever we go. The voice command does not work terribly well and often misinterprets or cannot understand what you are saying to it. Not a huge deal as I find this to be a useless feature on most devices, such as my cell phone. It works well for dialing numbers and answering phone calls, which is all I really need it to do anyway. Navigation voice command is touch and go. Beware that this vehicle takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.The trade off is you only have to change it every 10,000 miles, so that will likely save you money overall as it's basically three oil changes in one. There is a noticeable difference between the Eco, Standard, and Sport mode (although very slight). I found that I actually get the same mileage in Standard mode that I do in Eco mode, but Eco has less power when you're driving and accelerating. I'm not terribly aggressive on the peddle though. Sport mode does eat up a little bit of the MPG, but the vehicle seems to be more responsive. 95% of the time I just leave it in standard mode. Gets about 29 MPG with mixed highway and city driving, which is the sticker MPG. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but I'm fairly certain I could get between 30-32 MPG. The gas tank is listed at almost 16 gal, but I've yet to get more than 13 into the tank when the vehicle gas warning light first comes on. It's possible that there are another 3 gallons of fuel in there, I guess you wouldn't know until you actually ran the vehicle out of fuel. I love the back up cam, which is a nice standard feature to have for those city parking situations. Overall I'm am happy with the Rav4 thus far. We bought it for more passenger room and Toyota's reliability. Time will tell. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy one."
"03 23, 2016",Great Compact Crossver,"We have owned four Jeeps and got tired of the high cost of maintenance. We bought it as a Toyota Certified vehicle, it is extraordinarily good. We've owned it for three months and taken it into the mountains in snow, across the desert, and on 2-4 day cross country interstate trips from the Mojave to the Rockies and back. It's a keeper. It has three modes eco, regular and sport, and a very intelligent AWD system. Handles well, very comfortable, and while it does not have the ground clearance of a Jeep, we are extremely pleased with our purchase."
"03 22, 2016",Not at all impressed,"We bought our 2013 Rav4 new 3 years ago. We currently have 58,000 miles on it. There are 5 parking lot dings on the doors due to extremely thin metal. The ride is very rough, even with new tires, it is noisy on the highway. The canister oil filter is a real pain to replace....had to buy a special wrench from Toyota(expensive) and is almost worn out after 6 oil changes. The backup lights are very weak and hardly provide enough light when backing up. I really dislike the touch screen to change radio stations or other activities. In daylight you cannot see the screen. The Rav is missing numerous convenience storage spaces. Poor design overall, a elementary student could have given Toyota engineers better advise. Will be buying a CRV in near future...Very disappointed."
"06 29, 2015",Road noise and Yokahama tires,"I ha d 31 X 10.50 tires on my 94 pick-up that were quieter than the Yokohamas that came on my 2013 RAV4 XLE. These tires are the noisiest I ever owned with the exception of a set of Generals. When I hit even slightly rough road these tire are so loud I can't even hear the radio. Get a set a set of Michelin's as fast as you can.
The only other problem is that the large side panels are easily marred in parking lots. The vehicle needs side bumpers so that it doesn't look beat up in a very few years.
I fixed the glare on the interior backup screen by cutting a stiff piece of thin foam board around the top and sides. It isn't pretty but serves it's purpose.
All else considered I get great mileage 32.3 and putting it in sport mode to merge on the interstate is a thrill for the day. A very good vehicle that I would recommend, I'm still a Toyota fan just wish it came with quieter tires."
"05  6, 2015",Love. This. Vehicle!,"I just purchased my new (used) Rav 4 and I love it! It corners like it's glued to the road. The drive is so comfortable and even my 6' 2"" husband can sit very comfortably in the back seat! It's a dream."
"02 11, 2015",Enjoying the RAV4 Limited,"I've been very impressed with the vehicle so far. I came from an Acura RDX, which cost considerably more, but didn't offer any more features than the RAV4 Limited - and guzzled premium gas at 20 mpg. Although the Acura was more powerful, the RAV has plenty of pickup for all daily and highway driving. Pop it into Sport mode, and you get even quicker acceleration; or maximize your mileage in Eco mode - I average 25 mpg (about 60% city). I tested this SUV against the Mazda CX-5: although the Mazda may have been slightly sportier to drive (but not much), it fell way short of the RAV4 inside. The RAV is much more comfortable, roomy, and has all the luxury features (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) that the RDX had. I love the two-tone Terra Cotta interior. On the road, the ride is a nice balance between firm and shock-absorbing; it's not a Lexus, but it's quiet enough to make hands-free calls or listen to music (without blasting), and it handles all bumps smoothly. The sound system is quite good, and the navigation is adequate, though it has trouble finding points of interest. At 23,000 miles, I've had only two very minor issues: the rear hatch auto-opening mechanism (which I LOVE) had to be replaced (under warranty) when it failed, and the dashboard has started to rattle/squeak just a little, but only when the weather is below freezing. Unless the car falls apart, I expect to be happy with the RAV for years to come."
"01  9, 2015",Not much to brag about here,"There's not much I can say about the Toyota Rav4 LE except that it's a Toyota... which might mean a lot down the road. But for now, I'm not impressed. In fact, the 2013 Rav4 LE is really more irritating to me than anything else. There are features (or a lack of features) that are downright mystifying. When in park, the car rolls forwards or backwards for a greater distance than any other car I've owned. I haven't a clue why, except be careful that there's nobody behind you or in front of you when you put it in park. Otherwise, their toes might get squished. The plastic panels along the bottom of the front doors allow for all kinds of debris, dirt, snow and grime to enter the car's lower door interior. Again, why? What on earth were the engineers thinking when they added this lower door extension with a plastic shroud? The ""spoiler"" in the back just prevents your car from getting cleaned when in a car wash. Speaking of car washes, if you don't have a roof rack, watch out; the roof rack channel trim has a tendency to ""pop"" lose when going through the car wash's blow dryer. It happened to me twice.Toyota has no recommended solution for this.
I have a black interior. Which makes it extremely difficult to see the door handles and window and door lock buttons in the dark. Buttons are not backlit for the most part when the headlights are on. The auto window feature for the driver's side works when putting the window down -- but why not a one-touch feature for putting the window back up? What's the point of that? Very deceiving are the windshield wipers. On the turn signal, Toyota shows ""INT"" for intermittent wipers. In reality, there's nothing intermittent about the wipers at all. They turn on for slow speed or fast speed. Or not at all. That's it. They are not variable timing wiper blades. What car made today does not have this as a standard feature? This is 20 year old technology. I guess the answer is Toyota. Unbelievable. How cheap can you be? Although the interior looks refined, it's cheap and is prone to scratches and I suspect poor longevity. I had a stain on the silver rim of the air vent. When I went to wip the stain off with my licked finger... the silver paint came off!! Either I have the most caustic saliva known to man or Toyota is using the cheapest silver spray paint in the world. I'm going with the latter. The muffler or tailpipe rattles in idle making it sound like you have an exhaust leak. The brakes squeak when going in reverse. Cheap rotors? The engine is noisy. The undercarriage sound proofing is deafening... deafeningly loud. The heater / AC fan barely blows out anything in positions one and two. The doors feel lightweight and cheap. The salesman said ""Hey, you gotta shave back on something in order to get better mileage."" The transmission is an oxymoron. Why would you need a six speed auto transmission for a 4 cylinder car? How much gas savings can that really bring? As a six speed transmission, it always feels like the car doesn't know what gear to be in. As a driver, I feel like the transmission might go at any minute becauseof the way the transmission behaves. Very perplexing -- and as I said previously, irritating. I could go on and on about the irritating features this car has but I'm winded from complaining. If ten years from now I enjoy a trouble-free experience with this car, I'll overlook its idiosyncrasies, but until then I'm forced to live with these ""irritating"" features."
"10 29, 2014",Lacks basic features,"Toyota has gone cheap on this SUV.
We have the SLE with Nav package. It is very hard to see on a bright day and very limited in information provided.
Back-up camera is next to useless and gets blurred if it is raining.
We spend 5 months a year in the US and our Canadian model has no way to switch from Kilometres to miles also the GPS does not give a speed read out.
There is no DC power outlet for a cooler in the back seat.
We went from a 10 year old SUV to this and don't find it has as many features."
"10 23, 2014",2013 Rav4,"I'm enjoying this car. I've had RAV 4 in the past and I'm having a great time in this one. Added features off the power moonroof, fog lights,led screen miles analysis, control heating and the added 4 wheel drive feature is great. Now I have all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive in the same vehicle. The backup camera is great. The Sport mode and Eco mode also gives 2 options of control. I'm happy finally to get back into a SUV."
"10  3, 2014",Went from a Mustang to the Rav4 and LOVING it!!,"I bought my Rav4 brand new in the end of year sales December 27th and got a great deal on the price. I get 27.3 miles per gallon and I am at times very heavy on the gas. I have put just over 16,000 miles as this is a work vehicle for me and it still runs like the first day!! When I am on the road whether its highway or city the noise is very quiet compared to having a mustang before this!! The inside plastic is a little easy to scratch and I don't like having cloth on the door where you will be touching a lot but its a car not a house. I love the back up camera, cruise control and bluetooth! Three things that don't come standard on all vehicles in its category. This car also does great in very heavy rain where roads are flooded! I wouldn't have even know I was driving on a flooded road if the water wasn't spraying everywhere!! It did GREAT!! I do wish that the windshield wipers had more than slow, fast and faster but its just a pet peeve of mine and I can get over it. Tons of legroom in the back! Love that the back seats recline too! All around this vehicle is great!!"
"09  7, 2014",Wish I had not bought it...,"I waited 7 years for a new vehicle and had my heart set on the Rav-4 or the Honda CRV. We went with the 2013 Rav-4, I loved the look of it. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought it. At the test drive, I noticed all of the hard plastic inside, but did not realize how cheap it made the interior. Within 4 weeks we had an issue with the driver's door. We were told the ""welds"" had all come loose and a new door was ordered from Canada. Then parts of the roof rack came off, we went back to the dealer and had that replaced. A month or so later, the same parts came off the roof rack again! We never used the roof rack. My vehicle was white, my 4th white vehicle, under every door handle, under the gas tank door and under the two mirrors, each time it rained, black drip marks went down the entire vehicle at each of these places. Needless to say, at 4200 miles, I was done. I traded the vehicle in. We have a 2000 Toyota Sienna and the quality of that vehicle is so much better than the 2013 Rav-4. The vehicle I had seemed to be cheaply made, and it was not a cheap vehicle. This was our 4th Toyota, it will probably be our last."
"07 20, 2014",2013 Toyota RAV4 XLE,"Might be a little soon for this, but since the car is a 2013 model and it's July 2014 it's probably a good time since I'm now the second owner of this car. I purchased the TRav over the 4th of July just before my vacation to the ocean. After a 3 hour drive there, local Ocean City driving, and 3 hours back, I'm puzzled as to why the previous owner didn't keep the vehicle. Fun to drive; carried hubby and three teens around for a week or so and no complaints. Hubby has mostly all positive things to say also. Plenty of rear seat leg room and storage in the rear, and boy did we have it loaded down. Tks Toyota for the large side mirrors. Whoever thought of their size considered people like us that have the rear stuffed to the roof and no rear view mirror visibility. I was able to compensate just fine, and plan to purchase a roof rack. Believe me this isn't a knock to the TRav, but just an idea of what we packed. ENGINE: Performance for a 4-banger is excellent. There's enough engine and transmission options (ECO boost, Sport, and the neat Standard/Auto shifting) to make me feel that I've got enough options for all driving situations, and believe me I've used them so far. It's got some serious pep and delivers quickly. Gas mileage appears to be as advertised, but I'll probably be able to extend that carpooling back and forth from work since it's mostly highway. Soooo much better than my previous vehicle. TECHNOLOGY: Ok, this will be short from me since that wasn't much of a concern during purchase (Yeah, I'm in my early 50s - it shows). Love the back up camera, awesome bluetooth, excellent audio system, and hookups for iPODs, teenager gizmos, etc. Did I mention I love the bluetooth. Never thought I'd hear myself say that. ISSUES: Lack of lumbar support for cloth seats - Hubby has back issues so he's sensitive about this. See light color under scratches in red paint, but I plan to touch up and I'm very good at that sort of thing, so don't expect it to be a big problem. 4 stars for value for the money and reliability since that would depend on how trouble free the Rav will be in the future. Given the history of the Rav I'm hoping it will warrant 5 stars in a couple of years :) Additional PLUSES: Love how Toyota has the bottom of the body covered with the plastic and integrated into the bumpers. Figure I'll need that additional protection if we have another winter full of Polar Vortexes. Thought the dash design (bump out area to the glove box) was a bit odd at first, but after traveling around I've warmed up to it because it makes fiddling with the buttons easier. Lot's of additional hidden storage for tools and space around the spare tire for additional things. I'm a chick that likes her tools. All in all, I'm very happy with this vehicle and would recommend to a friend. Almost seems as though it was made just for me :)"
"06 24, 2014",Average vehicle,"We had a 2007 highlander, great car was a hybrid and got 28mpg consistently. The 2013 Rav 4 has great looks but it stops there. It's noisy, clunky ride and worst of all overstated mileage by toyota. We have coasted, drove flat roads, been very light on the gas and the best we get is 24.1 on highway and 22.4 in town in easy suburban driving. Had 4 toyotas, 2 highlanders, camray and this is the most disappointing mileage. Would not recommend."
"05  9, 2014",Average at best,"I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is ""average"". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average. Not a bad car, but easily outclassed by several competitors in its class."
"05  3, 2014",2013 Rav4,"Had an awesome experience purchasing my very first brand new car. I worked with Umesh, who helped me find the car I wanted withing my budget."
"05  1, 2014",I love it more every day!,"I've owned by RAV4 LE for 6 months. We had lots of snow this winter. The RAV always made me feel comfortable that I had good control of the vehicle. The windshield wipers and defrost work well. The gas mileage as calculated by the onboard computer says I've averaged 27.2 miles per gallon over the first 5400 miles. My manual calculation has it at 25.1mpg. I drive around with it in eco mode most of the time. When I'm in a passing or merging situation I reach over and press the sport mode button. The transmission will immediately drop 1 to 2 gears depending on my timing with the gas pedal. I love that button. The paddle shifting option doesn't work as fast. I'm 54, my 22 year old son agrees that the sport button works best when you are mostly operating in eco mode. The low load floor with no lip and lift gate rear make loading and unloading super easy. I'm not a super tech geek, so not having the GPS or blind spot sensors, found on the more expensive models, doesn't cause me any regret. I do like the back up camera. The side mirrors are large and well placed for backing up. My first car was a 1967 Dodge Coronet with shoulders that the RAV4 also tastefully incorporates. Great visibility, very strong cornering ability (this is not a sports car), good options for controlling the acceleration vs mpg, plenty of useful space, all come together to keep me smiling. The one area that I wish it were just a bit better is the left foot rest for the driver. That is a bit small and angled wrong for me."
"04 30, 2014",2013 Rav 4 Ltd.,"Outstanding vehicle in every respect. We would highly recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, economical and fun car."
"04 19, 2014",What a neat car,"WE bought our 2013 Rav4 Limited in November 2013. We were originally there to replace our tires on our 2010 Corolla and something catches our eye in the dealership. The Rav4 had the most compelling exterior design from the chrome in the headlamps to the ""rest-your arm"" on the rear-tail light. It was quite a change from the previous generation and it has grown on us. We decided to test drive a gray colored one. The ride wasn't too bad (but we own a rough-riding sports car so we are used to some bumps) but Toyota probably made it a little firm for handling purposes. The road noise was pretty minimal and when you opened the sunroof at 50+ mph, it was a little noisy. What REALLY made up our minds to buy the car were the immense amounts of technological features that it came with. Push button start with easy door-unlocking/locking, auto-dimming rearview mirror (this is great for that annoying headlight glare during the night), the great navigation unit, the blind spot monitor system with back up assist (although we wished the blind spot monitor made a noise when you tried to change lanes into another car), the vast amount of rear cargo space, the heated seats, the high driving position, and the bluetooth connectivity. I know that was a long list, but it was totally worth mentioning because it makes this car 100 times better than base models. The only problem we had since we bought the car was the power lift gate. Here in Florida we have lots of rainstorms. Water managed to get into the power lift mechanism in the gate and caused it to have a terrible squeak aw it went up. Fortunately toyota replaced it for free and it hasn't squeaked since. I use the car daily and gas mileage could be a little better. I know its rated around 26/31 but i feel like I've been getting a little worse, maybe 22/27. The transmission can be pretty smooth but if you been in a rodeo, the chassy seems to heave and ho upon acceleration. Its not the smoothest but its do-able. Rear leg room and head roof is plenty (I'm 6'0 and i fit perfectly fine behind my driving position. The two-toned leatherette seats are comfy but seem to wrinkle a little because the seat bolsters are in the way when getting in the car, so you are rubbing against it all the time. The eco mode has terrible acceleration but that's to save gas; the sport mode is peppy and good for fast-er accelerations and overtaking on highways, however, this accounts for poor gas mileage. I use normal mode for city driving. Overall, the Rav4 is a great deal with all the features it has. A bang for your buck. I would recommend it for families that want to take a nice cross-country road trip or those who use it to commute to work. Toyota truly lives up to their slogan with this car ""Let's go places""."
"04  1, 2014",Thankfully I don't do a lot of driving...,"I drove a 2009 Rav4 LE for almost 5 years and absolutely loved it. Now that I have the new 2013 Rav4 LE, I find myself wishing at times that I still had my old one...

I was given a brand new, 15 miles on the odometer, 2013 Rav4 from the dealership just over 2 months ago. I definitely like the interior more than the 2009 version with the back up camera, touch screen display, bluetooth, etc., but I also miss a couple of the old features too. I feel like there's less storageup front and the extrerior tends to scratch very easily. A lot of plastic additions and kind of silly to see fake plastic parts where lights would go on a higher edition. I don't have a far commute to work, so my gas mileage has been pretty decent, but I've never felt 100% comfortable in the car. I didn't even get off the lot yet, before turning the car around to ask why the brakes were making noise -- I was told they had to be ""broken in"" because it was sitting on the lot for so long. Brought the car back 4 days later because the bluetooth wasn't working correctly. I was told by 2 different people (including a specialist) that they didn't know how to fix it and I needed to bring it in for service.

Fast forward 2 months and the car has less than 2,000 miles on it. Not only does the transmission and acceleration make me nervous -- down shifts very quickly and has ""jumped"" forward on a couple occassions when putting the car into reverse. The engine has also been making a ""squealing/whining"" noise since I first got it when driving below 45mph and has a difficult time driving up hill. I've had to put my foot almost to the floor for it to accelerate. I plan on bringing the car in for service in the next couple of weeks and make note of these problems.

My 2009 Rav NEVER had a problem in the 4+ years that I had it. No engine noise, comfortable, no leaks, etc. I loved that car...this new one, is not so impressive. I think Toyota is a great car, but I'll think twice about getting another Rav4 once my lease is up in 3 years."
"02 14, 2014","Oh Hello, Space Ship.","First of all, I traded in my base-model chevy coupe for my next car, so anything I purchased would far surpass it. However, the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited was the best vehicle I test drove.

Having automatic-everything for the first time worried me a bit. The more electronics in the car, the more expensive it is to fix. Since it's a lease, I'm not too concerned with this issue. I especially like that I get the opportunity to replace my key fabs twice a year if anything happens to them.

I love everything about this car, especially the Blind Spot Monitor. I didn't think I would notice the light signals in the mirrors, but the sales guy, Brian Dobbs, convinced me to get it. It proved its worth within the first week of purchasing the Rav4.

PROS: Two Power Seat Setting buttons for the driver side so both me and a second person can switch back and forth in the driver side seat with ease. Seat Warmers, All-Wheel Drive. I love how the inside lights turn on when I walk up to the car. I flipped out the first night I witnessed it. I can connect my phone via bluetooth and use the car speakers to make phone calls (super plus!). The sound quality of the phone conversation isn't bad either. It gets good mileage, almost the same as my old coupe.

CONS: I thought it was strange that there aren't rear vents for the back passengers. Since I don't drive people around on a frequent basis, I'm not sure how this affects their experience. I also think it's odd that the middle cup holders for the back passengers are inside the center arm rest. If three people sit in the back, the middle person has to hold their drink. Again, this doesn't affect my experience with the car."
"02 13, 2014",2013 rav4 diesel,"We are the proud owners of a new rav diesel and I am pleased to say that that it is a delight to drive our trip from the dealers to home on the freeway averaged 5.5L/100 km and is whisper quite .Cannot fault the fit and finish however some brands like Hyundai put more effort into upholstery detail .We are stepping out of a 2002 s60 volvo and we find the seats to almost as good as the volvo .
It represented a more practical car than a hybrid vehicle .
With the vehicle set on cruise control 100 km/ hour on country roads it was un stoppable having mountains of toque to negotiate steep inclines.."
"02 10, 2014",Enjoying my Rav4 xle,"I have had my Rav4 XLE almost 3 weeks. LOVE IT, fun to drive. I had a Ford Edge and the gas milage was killing me. So happy Toyota changed the style of the exterior."
"02  1, 2014",one of the best car's I have ever owned,"This car is just the right size. Performs very well. I get great gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25 miles per gallon. It handles great in the snow. That is the number one reason I bought the Rav 4. I wanted all wheel drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. from the great sounding radio to the blind spot monitor, the backup screen, and the nav system and of course the Bluetooth for my phone and music. I really like the apps, such as Pandora.

Overall, this is one of the best cars I have ever owned and would recommend it. Toyota's service is second to none and that is extremely important in owning this vehicle."
"01 28, 2014",Hold On,"I have owned my Rav4 for six months and have owned many different cars and trucks in almost
50 years of driving . This is by far the vehicle with
the worst ride I have ever owned."
"01 21, 2014",Great Car,"I love my 2013 rav4 xle. Bought for my wife and wished it was for me. Great mileage and great exterior body. The only negatives is no leather or heated seats. camera works good when it doesn't snow or rain. Love the touchscreen on the dash. very impressed, i'm a honda person and glad i didn't buy crv. I live in Virginia and drive to Kansas and myrtle beach once a year. Drive for fun to D.C., Richmond alot. Love the white paint."
"01  1, 2014",Good car but Toyota cutting corners from earlier m,"I traded in my 2010 Rav4 for the 2013 model so I feel I can make a valid comparison. My 2010 LTD was a V6 so I knew going in that I was giving up excellent acceleration for a s0-so 4 cyl. But when considered against the new features of the 2013 I decided to trade it in. I got tired of the large swing door and lack of technology as found in the newer models. But here's where they cut some corners:
1. The spare tire is now inside (nice) but is no longer a full size tire and wheel but a temp.
2. The 2010 had real leather seats, now they employ something called ""soft-tek"" leather substitute.
3. The center console no longer two levels, just one large box.
4. On the 2010 there was a secondary glove box that had a push button release. Replaced by an open bin.
5. The interior and dashboard use more cheap looking plastic and no one will be fooled into thinking the carbon fiber surface is real.
6. One less 12V outlet and no 110V a/c outlet.

Even with all of the above, I don't regret buying this car. It's a good reliable vehicle with some nice technology. The price is lowest in it's class and the mileage is great. I get 28 mpg overall and it uses regular gas. However, if they brought back the V6 I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"12 22, 2013",You can't Make This Up,"Stranded at the dealership with a Uhaul in tow I asked the Sales guy to take me on a test drive with something comparable to my luxury vehicle which just decided to ""break up with me"". He suggested a Toyota Rav 4 Limited and I laughed saying I don't think so. I wanted comfort, a smooth ride, leather heated seats, auto seat adjustment with memory, navigation, performance with some get up and go. And decent gas mileage. No way was I expecting this in the Rav4 but I was wrong. Words that do not normally come out of my mouth. The Rav4 Limited is Awesome! Great ride, super cool looking, the performance is far beyond what I expected. Hugs the corners, has some power for a 4 Cylinder when in the Sport Mode. Surprising sound system, navigation and voice commend system is very nice and easy to use. Got a lot in this vehicle without the high ticket price of it's well known luxury model that I use to drive. Surprise, surprise. I love my Toyota Rav4 Limited."
"12 18, 2013",Honest Review 2013 RAV4 XLE AWD,"Let me start by saying that this may in fact be the right car for some but I will tell you about my experience with my current RAV4.
We found the Rav4 attractive for numerous reasons. We liked the overall styling of the exterior, though more black plastic than I liked but this seems to be a way for car manufactures to make some extra savings. I worried about it fading over time, which it will. I wasn't a fan of the rear end and I still do not care for it. this wasn't a deal breaker for me because what the exterior lacked the interior made up for it.
You get a lot of standard features on the XLE and that is why we chose it. Automatic Dual climate controls, roof rails, touch scree, back up cam, neat two tone color fabric, and so on.
We compared this to the escape (to small) and the CRV (noisy over the road).
PROs: smooth power train and enough power for the whole family. Me +3. roomy seating for all unless you squeeze 3 in the back. It's REALLY tight with three! Great cargo room even with the stroller. Road noise is minimal for this class compared to the competition. Nice interior and decent exterior.
This is why I'm rating this car so low and I have lost a lot of respect for Toyota quality.
CONS: The fake carbon fiber scratches extremely easy but the Toyota dealership replaced the scratched piece. Pretty nice of them. The ride is absolutely terrible! We did our initial test drive over some pretty smooth roads but once we got to driving it (after purchase) on other less improved surfaces, the ride was very noticeable. I'm pretty sure it's the rear suspension as it crashes over the smallest imperfections. The hood shakes and rattles all the time no matter the speed. There is a ""whine"" noise coming from the transmission when slowing down from 45+ mph. I also have some oil residue developing around the valve cover gasket. Toyota cannot find a leak. The transmission has a hard time on hills. Cruising at 70 mpg and climbing up a grade will case the transmission to downshift very hard once it finally engages. So hard that it woke my sleeping passengers and them asking if we hit something. All of these issues were brought to the dealerships attention and Toyota corporate. After several weeks and the car staying at the dealer for over two weeks, Toyota was unable to identify any problems. They took note of it and agreed with my complaints but say that these are characteristics of this vehicle. TOn top of all this, the bolts to the back hinge struts for the gate are developing rust and it is creating a rust streak down the column. Got to take it back to the dealer for this... yay, yet again.
After all of this I am pursuing the arbitration process and will try to get my money back. I cannot recommend this vehicle to anyone until they address these common issues with this model. Do a quick search or look on the forums and you will find I'm not the only with theses exact same problems.
I hate to say this, because I'm a Toyota fan, but do not buy this vehicle. If you choose to take anyways, PLEASE look for the problems I'm having as many others are experiencing the same. It's not worth it.... even for a Toyota."
"12  7, 2013",Car buying experience on a reliable car,The Toyota scion dealership in Apex NC made my car buying experience really smooth and fast. There was no pressure nor any hidden fees. I am very satisfied with overall experience. I will definitely recommend this place for new car buyers to try it out.
"11 28, 2013",Disappointed new RAV 4 owner,"I purchased a 2013 RAV 4 XLE with great expectations. What attracted me to this car was the exterior styling, well laid out and functional interior, back up camera, six speed automatic transmission, fairly peppy speed especially from the starting position, and good value for the price.

My disappointment has been the rear suspension ""slamming"" when driving over even modest speed bumps and breaks in the road, choppy transmission shifts especially in stop and go driving, loud muffler, and that incessant high pitched winding sound when accelerating that is so common to all Toyotas.

Of course when I asked the dealer to check out these aggravations, they predictably said it was ""normal"".

I previously owned a 2008 Honda CR-V and now wish I went with my gut and purchased a 2013 Honda CR-V.

I hope someone in authority from Toyota reads this review, takes it seriously, and start to make corrections to an otherwise very fine car."
"11 22, 2013","Nicest, and maybe last, car I've owned","RAV4 is roomy, with lots of extras standard; wouldn't have asked for Bluetooth or sun roof, but nice to have. Gas mileage is what Toyota posted, Solid feel, handles fine, peppy enough especially with EcoMode turned off (which we only do to get on the freeway). We drive cars for 10 years & 200,000 miles; hope this car will go at least that long."
"11  9, 2013",great deal,yours to discover this professionals and unbelievable sales representatives and great deal. and great car.
"11  8, 2013",Everything I needed and more,"Rides like a dream, turns on a dime... OK maybe a sliver dollar but tight. Gas mileage was excellent and it handles well in city and Long road trips. Entune is easy to set up and the auto seat settings for each driver is sure handy.

There is one minor disappointment, a nit ... that I've experienced in this superb vehicle - no built in garage door opener/Home Link capability.. Yep!!! Limited package I bought had all upgrades plus the dealer is so confident I received an extra year of No Cost Maintenance. And have we got room to spare. Moved 2 cats and a parrot 1200 miles easily. Get one of your own."
"11  6, 2013",5th Toyota,"I believe that Toyota missed the boat when they designed the interior. I have a 2013 RAV 4 LE with cloth seats. Seats are uncomfortable. The front seat head rests are as hard as a 2X4. They light grey put cloth on the inside of the door panels where ones hand touches every time the door is opened. I can just imagine what it will look like the first time a greasy auto mechanic opens or closes the door. Every time I make a right turn, I change the radio station or go to Bluetooth. The buttons to control the radio are too close to the outside of the steering wheel."
"10 25, 2013",Toyota - What a Joke,"I purchased my 3rd RAV4 this year in June 2013. Driven over 5,000 miles and Toyota you've totally let me down.
Primary uses: Commuting to work, shuttling kids to activities, going on trips to camp, bike, hike and kayak.

Performance:
The ECO mode is a joke - for my driving (mix of country roads, city and hwy) I get better gas mileage in normal mode. One would think going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would get better gas mileage. NOT! Worse gas mileage than my 2010. You would think they would work to improve it not go the other way.
Responsiveness and performance is sluggish at best. When accelerating to get on the highway, constantly have the RPMs at 4 or 5 ? Never had this issue in my old RAV?s. I also drive my mother?s Subaru Forester which drives and handles extremely better than this RAV in ?normal? mode. If you put it in ECO mode it is even worse. Mode (Sport,Eco) Buttons are not convenient and are a safety hazard to switch to Sport mode for those times I have to accelerate fast to merge onto the highway.

Features:
? Satellite is flaky. In my last RAV it worked like a charm and we really enjoyed it, now it cuts in and out. Dealership told me ?that is just the way Satellite works?. Umm, driving the same routes no I don?t think your answer is correct.
? Bluetooth constantly reboots my phone and is unusable. Again the dealership said can?t be the RAV it?s the phone; tried 3 other phones and still does the same thing. Phone company checked phones (Motorola and LG) and said no issues.
? Like the automated hatch, have not had the problems others seem to mention with piston failure.
? Rearview camera is the bomb.

Exterior Styling:
? Good copy of Mazda and Hyundai and others. No originality. Have gone from leader of the pack to follower.
? Can't believe the paint has mildewed!

Interior Styling:
? TOTALLY miss the storage compartment that was taken away to house the spare tire. Must less functional storage capability. Used this feature a lot in my old RAV to store chairs, purchases, etc.
? Miss the additional plugs behind the console for the rear seat and in the rear of the vehicle.
? Some controls are easy to reach for my short arms, others are hidden or hard to reach.
? Overall feels downgraded.

Value for the Money:
Should have gone with Subaru or Mazda. Looking to trade it in for another vehicle."
"10 23, 2013",Toyota's-all,"I have had several Toyota cars and pickup and they have all been good.

I do wish you had kept the swing door, much easier to open for a women or make all of them with power tailgate"
"10 20, 2013",I'm lovin' it,"I like the feel of the size of RAV, the finish is outstanding , the navigation and the entertainment systems CONS:difficult to read the gauges especially outside temp (passengers like to know the temp as well )Heated seats do not have variable settings."
"10 14, 2013",2014 RAV4 - The Best Car ... so far,"I purchased a Rav4 in March 2013 - I love It! I previously owned a Nissan, and 2 Honda Civics; but so far this is the best. My only concern is I am not seeing the Metallic Green on the color chart;... is it that they are not making it any longer...?"
"10  7, 2013",2013 Toyota Rav4! Fun to drive!,"Hello, having driven a 2005 Nissan Maxima for nearly 9 years and 215K+ miles, it was time to move to a something different. I knew that I was tired of driving a sedan and wanted something with solid gas mileage, stylish, fun to drive yet sat higher up than I was use to. Enter the 2013 Rav4.

What a great little SUV. It's a head turner, believe it or not. Gets great gas mileage, has a smooth ride, is very fun to drive and has lots of room for all types of things. Sorry for the short review, but i highly recommend it."
"10  5, 2013",moving from a Camry to RAV4,"I am enjoying the RAV4, Only one problem and that it is cuts out occasionally so I will have to take it back to a dealer to have that item checked. Dealer Bountiful Toyota, was excellent in every way. Friendly, efficient and wanted to meet my needs in a car."
"09 25, 2013",Broke 6 days after purchase,"This is my third Toyota vehicle.
I had been a long believer of Toyota quality until now.
I had all my maintenance and services done at Toyota on my previous vehicles and have the stamp book to prove it.

It had been less than a week since I purchased my 2013 RAV4 and took it off the lot

I was unloading the trunk when the hatch fell on me.
The right arm holding the hatch came straight off the door and took some paint with it on the way down.

I know I am not the only 2013 RAV4 owner with this issue because there are several online forums that mention this.
I also know there is an updated version of the piston for the hatch available.

I have been in contact with the dealer and Toyota to get the car fixed.The dealer took the defective piston, compressed it, and put it right back onto the hatch.They didn't put the updated pistons on or even a new one.

Toyota also stated that they will not replace the defective piston unless they issue a recall. They said I will have to wait until it breaks again.

The 2013 RAV4 is a nice looking car, but Toyota customer service and quality have fallen a long way."
"09 24, 2013",Fun to Drive,"I was worried about the 4 cylinder, but this car has some spunk. I really enjoy driving it. It has a ""Sport"" button when you want to waste gas and an ""Eco"" button for when you want to save gas. Who could ask for more? Steering feels good, too. I think I made a good decision.

I haven't had it very long, so reliability is based on Toyota's pedigree."
"09 24, 2013",Not Powerful Enough,"The 4-cylinder engine in the new Rav4 is way too small. Why did Toyota do away with the 6? Highway driving is difficult as there's not nearly enough power. The new design also gives this vehicle a very cheap feel. I used to have a 2010 Rav4 with the V6, and this new one is about five steps down! Yes, you will get Toyota reliability, but that's about it. If you liked the wood panneled station wagons in the 80s, then you will love the new Rav4."
"09 23, 2013",This 2014 RAV 4 model is a Flop for Toyota,"My Toyota Sequoia was in the body shop for a minor accident and the rental car service provided me with a 2014 RAV 4 Base Model in black color. The Exterior design is flawless but when it came to the interior design, Toyota lost it big time. I drove this suv for a total of 200+ miles in a couple of days and here is my honest review on it. The front seats are very uncomfortable, hard and short and you want to get out of it after driving 30 minutes. Forget about taking the long interstate trips in this RAV 4. It is also very jumpy and I thought may be the tires are over inflated but I was wrong. The engine noise and road noise is loud and feels like you have a window open somewhere in the suv. Everything you touch inside the cabin feels hard plastic. The middle armrest between the front seats is a joke and Toyota should have done a better job in designing this armrest and more comfortable cushioned seats considering long trips that buyers might take in this suv. The standard rear view camera is a Big Plus. The Eco drive mode did save on the gas. The sports mode is fun to drive only if you do short driving. I was considering buying this 2014 RAV 4 but after my driving experience I say No Thank you ! So if you are interested in buying this 2014 RAV 4, my advice is to go and rent it and drive it around for a couple of days. If you think you still like it then its your choice but don't go to the dealership for a short test drive and then be stuck with it."
"09 22, 2013",Interesting new technology,I recently downgraded from a VW Routan minivan to RAV4. The car is very stylish and still roomy. The Pandora Box and Traffic apps are very interesting. The car is very comfortable and has good pickup. Very easy to park compared to a large minivan. I like the push start instead of a traditional key.
"09 19, 2013",jgolfski,"This vehicle is good looking, economical, and fuel efficient. the limited has the technology that vehicles costing $10,000 more have. One great car!!!"
"09 18, 2013",Rides too harsh!,"Toyota did a very good job on most of this vehicle. I leased a 13 xle and have had the it 6 months now. At first, the ride seemed firm but it starts to wear you out after a period of time. I do a lot of city driving and this vehicle lets you feel and hear everything on the road. It really takes away from an otherwise nice vehicle. The good side is city gas mileage...23-24 good...the exterior, everyone makes nice comments. I have had the vehicle in some nasty storms and it was a trooper. The engine is noisy but plenty of power. The transmission is top notch and the pseudo manual is really good and easy . No problems and that's what i expect from
Toyota, the harsh ride is just too much to take. Thank goodness, i found an excellent seat cushion for it. At the end of the lease, it's going back...too bad, it could have been great. Also, Toyota needs to fix the touch screen. It's easy to operate but in the sun, your on your own. You can't see a thing on it...."
"09 18, 2013",Better Size Engine/MPG than the other SUV's.,"I looked for over 6 months and primarily focused my interest on the Honda CRV because of it's size and style inside. Then when I came across the 2013 new RAV4, there were only two things that caught my eye: 2.5L engine and 30mpg gas. A bigger engine with better gas mileage? Cool! Took the test drive - there are 3 models and two wheelbase sizes 17 inch in the Base and XL model and 18 inch tires for the Limited. I test drove both - the 18 inch drove much smoother (the new car is stocked with Bridgestone tires). I like the drive, the features and room (especially the backseat) of the Limited. However, the engine is an electronic 6 speed that does make a ""wining"" noise when accelerating. The radio drowns it out. The car is fast, good acceleration, good gas mileage and nice interior (it's not real leather - it's a imitation leather, according to the dealership, because it is lighter and more humane than using real leather. Everything about the car is focused on ""lightness."" of all aspects - body, engine, transmission, etc., which all leads to better gas mileage for the bigger engine. Works for me!"
"09 16, 2013",Poor interior design,"Top glove box no door?
front console area only has one side, things fall onto floor,
no auto headlights, can't see display in sunlight,
we purchased an XLE, it came with a sun roof, but you can't get a power seat or leather or interior hatch release.
Mechanically it is Toyota, but the interior design and options are from another world. We tried a limited but that Softex is a poor substitute for leather."
"09 12, 2013",Bigger engine - better gas mileage than other SUVs,"I looked for 6 months for my first SUV; looked at Honda CRV....wanted style, gas mileage, bigger engine and a reasonable price for the model. I test drove the CRV but didn't like the handling or road noise. I had a Toyota Solara for over ten years so I knew about the Toyota quality. I looked at the New RAV 4 and what caught my eye was 1) size of interior ; 2) bigger engine than the CRV (2.5L vs 2.4) but it got better gas mileage! Rides like a car. With the Limited model you get 18-inch, vs 17 -inch tires on the base or XLE model. The engine is a 6 speed electronic that whines a bit. Eco option is a gas saver. Gets approx 24 mpg city. No road noise with the 18 inch tires. A little more with 17 inch. Great back seat space and good storage space in the back...LOVE IT!!"
"09 12, 2013",Short Life!!!!,"We have a 2006 RAV 4 and yes, we have 170,000 miles on it. But it should last for a lot longer. It uses a quart of oil every 600 miles and the transmission has just gone out. We have all the maintenance records with the dealership and drive very, very mildly. We have found blogs on other web sites having the same issues we have so if you want to get a vehicle to last 200,000+ miles, it's not the RAV 4!!!!"
"09  8, 2013",Beautiful SUV,Excellent value for the money. I love the 3 different driving modes and the gas mileage.and the roomy interior. I have the CR-v no comparison .
"09  8, 2013",Crashed,"Just got the RAV4 and had a horrific crash into a semi , whole front , and rt. door torn off . Most people would be dead in this type of crash . All 8 airbags saved them from injury. The RAV 4 saved my family , they walked away from a certain death ."
"09  4, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited,"Toyota hit a homerun with the 2013 RAV4. From the minute I test drove mine I was hooked. I love the comfort of the seats and having ""all"" the controls on the steering wheel cuts down on distractions. It's just a well thought out SUV. I love the NAV system it is very easy to use even for a fifty something guy like me. I bought it and the same day I drove it 300 miles across Texas."
"08 19, 2013",happy with purchase,I'm pleasantly surprised with the mpg I'm getting. I average 32.5 mpg (75% highway). I use the ECO mode only. No problems so far and I currently have 4000 miles. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable awd that drives like a car and gets really impressive gas milage.
"08 15, 2013",Poor Gas Mileage,"We purchased the 2013 two wheel drive Rav4 in July and have put about 2500 miles on it so far. We always drive it in Eco mode and have yet to get anywhere close to the stated mileage for the vehicle. Consistently it is getting 26 mpg (not 31 mpg as stated on the sticker) on the highway (driving 75mph with a/c on). We are careful to accelerate slowly in order to get the best gas mileage we can, but to no avail. In the city, we are getting 22 mpg. There again, we are not making rapid accelerations nor quick stops. My Toyota dealer just says, ""hu"" and has no answers. The only reason we sold our 4Runner, was to get a more efficient car and by going to the Rav4, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped."
"08 11, 2013",excellent fuel economy,"GREAT M.P.G ,after topping off the tank ,took a 105 mile road trip & got a whopping 42 miles per gallon with the eco switch on ......... yes 42 mpg ,with 4 people in the vehicle ...... 105 miles used 2.5 gallons of regular fuel . after topping it off again we used it around town somewhat city driving and retopped to find that we got 34 mpg city . so I did some investgating and found that Toyota wasn't able to check the fuel economy with the eco button on and hadn't any idea what difference it would make . lol THANKS TOYOTA !!"
"08  9, 2013",Best car I've owned yet!,"This car has the best safety ratings and feul economy for small SUVs. It also has great suspension, the car will glide over train tracks. It has comfortable seats and an awesome back up camera.

I received wonderful customer service from Toyota of Murfreesboro, especially Gus who sold me the car. All of the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car. I would refer anyone there.

Toyota offers a lifetime warrenty on 2013 vehicles, with 2 yr/2400mile maintenace package for free."
"07 27, 2013",Great Car!,"Traded in my Lexus ES for the Rav Limited. Wanted better mileage and more cargo room. Have had car for about 5 months. In ECO get 30 mpg in town, 29 this summer with AC. Have not tried the Sport mode yet.

I like the interior, think the seats are easier to maintain than leather. Interior design works just fine for me, easy controls, apps are great. The Blind Side Monitoring is fantastic, especially when backing out of a parking space. The back up camera screen is great. But I will say, I like the one in my husband's Toyota truck better as the camera screen is on the mirror.

The 2 year free maintenance is a plus as is Toyota reliability. Keyless door locks are so convienient .

One thing I would have liked is an adjustable passenger seat. Small thing I guess but Toyota should have added that, especially on the Limited.

I did test drive a KIA sedan and found it noisy, and cheap feeling. Have had the Lexus RX, IS, ES so that is all I really have to compare the Rav to and I find this car just fine. I like the road feel, being able to see better on all sides, mileage, interior, nice exterior style. Apps work great too, Bluetooth wonderful."
"07 22, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited AWD is OK with some issues,"We've driven nothing but Toyotas since 1968 (a Corona). For my needs, the ""Limited"" trim package was a good value and worth the cost. The RAV4 replaced a Camry XLE V6. The styling is fine (especially the power rear hatch) and interior room is good. The solid black interior is much nicer than the odd two-tone alernatives. Seat comfort in the driver's seat with the faux-leather is OK thanks to the lumbar support, but the lack of a power passenger seat seems cheap. The NAV system is easy to operate. Overall gas mileage has been better than the EPA estimate. The interior trim (mainly the center console) has too much hard/flimsy cheap-feeling pastic. The 2.5 engine performs well whether in eco or sport mode - I keep the vehicle in eco mode all the time. Overall, I view my new RAV4 as one of the better Toyotas I've owned."
"07  1, 2013",Rav 2013 review,"Just picked up our 2013 Rav Limited last week.
In our 2011 Rav there was a space to the right of the steering wheel where I could keep change.

No outlet in back seat for kids hand held games.

Nav screen to flat should pitch to drivers side.

No power seat on passenger seat.

No real spare tire."
"06 30, 2013",good small SUV,"Good design, good mileage, good price and fun to drive. I got a very good deal from Matia Toyota dealer in Sacramento, CA.
I have been shopping for some many Toyota dealer throughout Ca."
"06 26, 2013",Great Improvement,"Was considering an SUV but never paid much attention to the RAV4. When I saw the 2013 I loved the style and especially the new rear hatch. Some reviewers were concerned about performance, I can tell you there is a distinct difference driving in Sport Mode VS ECO Mode. This one is a true winner, Great Value. The XLE upgrade over the base model is well worth the small cost increase."
"06 15, 2013",New Rav4,"I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage with a 2013 year, I had a 2003 Nissan Altima and could expect at least 30 mpg on the highway. I'm 2 or 3 miles lower with a newer car, maybe it will get better, I hope"
"06  7, 2013",good car,"Great resale value, comfortable, easy to use, good fuel economy, and great sales person (kyle). I recommend this car highly!"
"06  6, 2013",Wonderful Experience at Toyota of Greensburg,"Bought a Rav 4 at Toyota of Greensburg and was treated wonderfully. Zach Guy my sales person and Brian the sales manager gave me a great deal on my trade and a great discount on the new vehicle. If you're thinking of buying a new Toyota stop in at Toyota of Greensburg, you won't be disappointed."
"06  1, 2013",RAV4,Gas milage seems to be very good. The standart back-up camera is extremely helpful when paralel parking. Seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room in the back seats. Ample cargo area. Surprisingly good pick-up when merging onto a highway. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
"05 26, 2013",lack of highway power,"took for a long test drive. city driving was ok, had enough power but when i took it on the highway and put it to the floor it was powerless. didnt have the power to jump over in the passing lane without getting run over. i was very dissapointed since i was ready to purchase. oh well, ill keep looking"
"05  6, 2013",Nice Ride,"Bought a 2013 RAV4 XLE. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip and averaged over 35 MPG traveling 65-70 MPH. It was a quiet, smooth ride. Very Happy with it. The only thing I would like is a more versatile center console that fits a cup with a handle, and maybe a more solid hood. Over rough roads the hood flexes some. It is a minor issue, just an aesthetics type thing. No regrets buying it so far."
"05  6, 2013",First new car for me,"I was looking to replace a 13 year old Toyota Camry. I originally looked at the prius, camry, honda civic, honda insight. I saw the new Rav4 and took it for a drive.

It was comfortable and loved the XLE trim upgrade for only $700. Well worth it.

The Econ mode lets me ge 38 MPG on the highway driving 55MPH on flat roads.

The SUV is extremely comfortable and hold all my gear and can carry my two kayaks on the roof racks.

I love the electronics. Ipod connects both bluetooth and through usb cable.

I love this car. Thinking about buying another one to replace my wifes Honda element."
"05  5, 2013",Best small suv,"The changes made to the 2013 are excellent. I would have bought a Honda CRV if Toyota had not changed the lift gate and spare tire. I waited four months for the RAV4 to get manufactured and delivered to local dealerships. It was worth the wait! I bought the Limited model and love the options that come on that model. I have had the vehicle three weeks and have been getting excellent gas milage. There is nothing that I don't like about the vehicle.

For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4.

I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle.
The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's.

Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"
"04  3, 2013",the best car I ever had,"We bought our first Toyota RAV 4in 2007.....For 5 years we had no problem at all..but we lost IT.in SANDY...and we had no doubts that we should buy again RAV 4,,model of 2013....The car that we had before our first RAV 4_ was Land Rover...and it was not that reliable like TOYOTA .RAV 4...."
"03 20, 2013",First SUV,"I started my purchasing process setting up with a buying service and using an insurance company's recommendations. I had no intention of purchasing a Toyota, in fact I was opposed to the idea. I'm still surprised I purchased one.

I had test driven the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-5, Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox, Lincoln MKX, Subaru Outback, and Forester.

I needed a car like ride, and room for several suitcases or crates in the back, I wanted AWD, leather heated seats and good MPG. Didn't think I'd get all that.

There are a lot of good choices, I do believe I could have been happy with several of these.
I bought an AWD Limited with no additional options.

the pluses of the RAV4:
* bluetooth, it works flawlessly. Didn't expect to have that standard
*Nice ride, quiet cabin.
* I'm averaging 27 mpg (1500 miles) though I drive aggressively. When driving in eco mode and being mindful of mpg, I can get 31 mpg.
*AWD was perfect for our recent snows. I drove it in 6"" of fresh unplowed snow. It's surefooted.
*keyless entry. . With gloves on in winter it's just so much easier.
*the 2 tone interior looks great.
*great ride, even in the back seats.
*Plenty of leg room for my tall family.

Negs:
*so so stereo. (3 others were far better) I did not get Nav. or the stereo upgrade My previous car had a better stereo. It's 8 yrs old too. A new stereo on their top tier style should sound better.

* The dealers all advertise the seats in the Rav4 Limited as leather. They are NOT. I'd decided on the Rav4 after driving the Honda. That dealer told me the Rav4 seating was a synthetic/leather blend. After researching the Softex I called the salesman on it, he then checked on it and it's synthetic. I felt deceived. I can't believe they don't know it's not leather. I went to 3 dealers and heard the same thing.
(I asked for and received an additional price cut by the dealer, for their mistake.) . I do like the feel of the Softex, and hope it lasts like leather."
"03 18, 2013",Great Car,Keep making Great cars and trucks for generations to come!!! Will have 3 kids needing cars in the next few years
"03  8, 2013",Third Rav4,"We leased a 2006, purchased a 2010 and just got the 2013. The 2006 had a 6 which could make your nose bleed when punching it at a light...whee. All were reliable with no issues. The only complaint(s) are we miss the dual lid on the console storage box, the sliding cover on the upper dash storage shelf and the sunglasses storage in the roof. The backup camera is awesome as is the Bluetooth sync for your phone. We got a little organizer for the console storage and are looking for some kind of box for the open dash shelf. With only 500 miles we are getting better mileage than the 2010."
"03  7, 2013",Happy so far,"Have owned only 3 weeks but am happy with my choice. Was also seriously considering a Honda CRV and looked at several other crossovers (every make has one and they all look about the same). Preferred the RAV4 XLE (FWD, cloth seats) exterior and interior design and the timing chain (vs. CRV's belt which requires major $ to replace at 80,000 miles). Also dealer provided lifetime powertrain warranty at no additional cost. Toyota made some nice improvements on the 2013 model vs. prior ones. Hopefull still one of the most reliable cars made."
"03  5, 2013",First New Vehicle Purchased,"My husband and I took the plunge and bought our first New Vehicle EVER after our beloved Jeep rolled over 200k miles and ceased to be as reliable as we wished. We did a ton of lot shopping and test driving before finally making a deal with the very professional staff at Rouen Toyota in Maumee, OH. Our salesman Byron was top notch and spent a lot of time showing me all of the features of my new Rav4. He was knowledgable, patient, and kind toward our children. I would recommend this dealership, Byron, and our new SUV to everyone. The Rav4 has the fuel economy we'd been lacking and the space we've grown accustomed to with our Jeep and Tundra Pickup. A good price and a zippy vehicle for my everyday commute."
"03  4, 2013",RAV 4 Limited,This car drives and handles much better then Honda CR-V EX-L. Can't go wrong for the price and reliability rating. if your are in compact SUV market consider this car.
"02 28, 2013",Looks like the rest performs like a dog,"A long time Toyota RAV owner and fan, this car was a huge disappointment. All the hype AROUND THE LATE REVEAL...LOOKS LIKE ALL THE REST IN ITS CLASS! Performance....felt like I could run faster and the ""engine sounds and performance says cheap""...not the sticker...very disappointed...will take a look at some others..suggest you do the same and compare before you buy!"
"02 27, 2013",lovin' my new car,"When looking for a new car I knew I wanted a small SUV. I looked at a few different makes and models from other dealerships. I absolutely fell in love with the 2013 Rav4. Just this year they came out with the new Rav4 without the tire on the back of it. It is just a beautiful car inside and out. It might be a small SUV but has a ton of room inside and the back seats even recline! The only thing that they could improve on is the back speakers. They are in the door and its hard to hear anything in the back, other than that, I love everything about it."
"02  9, 2013",Best Looking little SUV.,Reliable SUV. Just right. Smooth ride. Love the new hatch back door. Blessed to own one. Was waiting for Toyota to make pop up back door without the tire on the door. Got one right away.
"01 19, 2013",RAV4 - Much improvement!,"I disagree with the reviewer that removing the 3rd Row option from the RAV4 was a mistake. It was silly to offer such an option in a small SUV - not even a child could fit. I'm sure demand was very low so Toyota made a wise business decission.

I just purchased a 2013 yesterday and I love the new design. I had a 2010 4 Cylinder RAV4 before and have always been happy with the 4 Cylinder. I have driven a V6 in the past and did not see the need for a V6 in this car. I have plenty of power and in the new RAV4, I have Eco and Sport mode.

Hurry out and test drive one. I love my Display Audio and the Bluetooth setup in about 60 seconds."
"11  4, 2023",The RAV4 is the best running car I’ve ever had.,I love my 2013 RAV4. It runs great. I haven’t had any problems with it. The key is to always keep up the maintenance  Toyota makes the best cars.
"03  5, 2023",2013 Rav4,"Car is very reliable, i have had it almost 10 years. It has 155,000 mi
Have replaced the normal things like brakes and tires. It has a stiff ride, changed shocks and struts and still stiff. which is the #1 disappointment. Between 45 and 55 it has a bad vibration.."
"11 25, 2022",Terrible handling/ride,Worst ride ever. CD player had to be repaired. Battery needed to be installed. Dealership held back on providing problems. Probably my fault for not asking. Just relied on the  Toyota name. Headlights  were foggy and should have been improved .Defect in left front fender. Needed a wheel alignment. I could go on. I was the fool.
"09  9, 2022",I had to replace bulbs several times.,"2013 RAV4 I bought this small SUV with 25,000 miles. This car is Mexico/Canada build. I am gonna keep it short when this car passed the 105,000 miles started to fall apart( literally). The car is “affordable “ because it is built with cheap parts, and replacement are very expensive. I had to replace shock absorbers, many lights, and TRANSMISSION."
"04  5, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable,"Interior and exterior appearance are just perfect. It has plenty of power and provides a smooth ride in any weather condition.
We have owned this car for 4 years and will keep it for another 4 years at least."
"12 14, 2020",Glad to be back in a Toyota.,We had an older RAV4 and when looking for another vehicle knew we wanted to check out something newer.   Toyota has door a good job in updating the look and comfort without compromising the performance.   Happy to have given another RAV4 a home.
"09  4, 2020",The nicest comfortable vehicle so far,"this car meets all I  need in a vehicle, roomy, comfortable , allot of power, and not to complicated. great handling car , smooth ride. I would buy another."
"08 16, 2020",Reliable Small SUV,"We have 50,000 miles on this car.    So far no defects.    Fabric seats hard to clean.  We get 24 city and 28 highway mpg from the base 4 cylinder engine.   A bit noisy on long trips."
"05 30, 2020",Not a car for comfort or room,"This car is extremely uncomfortable, very stiff over bumps. It doesn't have a lot of room inside and nothing makes sense to me. It's just too bad because Toyota has always been one of my favorite vehicles. But they really did a horrible job on this one. I would never get a rav 4 again after that."
"05 24, 2020","Safe, durable reliable.","The Rav-4 is a great SUV for folks who have long winter commutes. The safety features just keep getting better and that truly matters. You can expect to put 300,00 miles on the speedometer with very few repairs."
"05 19, 2020",Beautiful car,"This car exceeds my expectations so far.  Rides beautifully, quiet, and smooth.  Definitely enjoy driving this vehicle.  Good gas mileage and a good solid, reliable car that comes highly recommended by my mechanic."
"05 18, 2020",Love the car,Haven't driven it long but so far I love it. It's comfortable and drives great. I like the compact look but still is roomy inside.
"04 22, 2020",Overall Great Car,"This was the first car I have purchased. A limited edition Toyota RAV4. It has leather seats, sunroof, and is a beautiful cherry red color. I love everything about this car but I wish the screen inside the car looked a little more updated. But can't be too picky considering it is a 2013. I am love with this car. Also drives very smoothly and has good pick me up. Would recommend this car to anyone."
"03 30, 2020",It is exactly the right car for me.,"This car is easy for me to get in and out of.  It suits my needs, is easy to park, and has been so reliable.  I've received many compliments on it since it was new, even from strangers in the grocery store parking lot."
"03 23, 2020",reliable and dependable car,"the suv meet the need of my daughter day to day commute from home to work and to do some run around.i will highly recommed this suv to any one that need a reliable car, economy and fuel efficient."
"03 22, 2020",Gray Phantom,"I thoroughly enjoy this car. It's comfortable, easy to drive, dependable, sporty, carries everything I need or want, and also carries the Thule cargo carrier on top fully loaded."
"01  9, 2020",Transmission issues,"Transmission failed after 96,000 miles. New transmission installed and slipping after 16,000 miles with torque converter shuddering. Every mechanic i knew said get a Toyota, they're soooo reliable. Now idk what to get. This makes me so suspicious of every car I look at."
"11 19, 2019",More then I hoped for!,"Was looking for SUV/AWD/Navigation.  Got more then that!!!  Limited and Loaded 
Feels so awesome driving my new Toyota RAV4
Thank you Blaise Alexander Subaru of Williamsport"
"11  2, 2019",Good city car,City car for convenience. Reliable transportation. Not a highway car. Lacking the smooth ride due to light weight and under power. I should have bought the Highlander. The wife loves the ease of parking.
"10 21, 2019",I’m not sure,My car kinda shift gears or jerk can’t really explain it but it does that if I’m driving under 40mph. Not sure what’s wrong with it hope my transmission isn’t slipping. I have a friend who has the same exact one but hers 2 years newer mines a 2013 and hers does the same thing.
"09 14, 2019",First time I have ever Owned a Toyota,First time ever owning a Toyota SUV I really like the vehicle if you’re looking for an SUV Toyota RAV4 is really a nice ride
"08 19, 2019",Fun to drive!,"I wasn’t sold on this vehicle at first but after a few days I grew to love it! It’s super fun to drive & has most of the features I want in a vehicle. The front and back are super roomy...my bf who’s 6’ tall fits extremely well & comfortably in both the front & back of the vehicle. It has a great ride & gets good mpg. I would have given it 5 stars BUT this vehicle lacks a few very important features...ones I didn’t think to ask about because quite frankly I just assumed every vehicle had it these days. My bad! What it doesn’t have is air conditioning vents in the back of the suv! Say what!? I know...I was quite shocked to discover this as I was driving my kids around on a hot day...the vent in the dash...which the right half of is fake and doesn’t work...is supposed to cool off the back of the vehicle. Why oh why would anyone ever design a vehicle to not have a/c vents for the backseat passengers??? Another key feature it doesn’t have is remote start, however, some will have that...but don’t be like me & think it’s standard because it’s not & now I have to pay to have an after market remote start installed. Ugh. One last thing I don’t like & honestly thought no vehicle had anymore is a lever inside the vehicle on the floor alongside the drivers seat that you have to press to open the gas tank. Let’s just say the first time I stopped for gas was quite the experience. It took me a few to figure out how to open the door...sigh. But overall it’s a good vehicle."
"08 11, 2019",Boring but reliable,"Very very reliable, no issues at all. Engine is underpowered, but good all wheel drive system and roomy interior. Good value for the money if you don’t care about engine performance"
"07 23, 2019",Great Value RAV4,"This car was a good in all weather, reliable, and well put together.  It performed new as it did 7 years later.  Toyota quality is apparent."
"07 16, 2019",good family suv,"rides good, looks good, goes great in the snow.  small suv small but big with lots of room.   the dealship wait area is clean with lots of chairs, popcorn and ice cold bottle water.  a play area for the little ones.  all family members are welcome."
"05 20, 2019",Most reliable car I've ever owned.,Great all around vehicle. Very roomy and great gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4. They're just really well built and reliable. I love Rav 4's.
"05 13, 2019",WIFE'S NEW CAR,"WIFE LOVES THIS CAR! SHE REPLACED HER LEXUS IS250 WHICH WAS A GREAT CAR. I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD MISS HER LEXUS, BUT LIKES THIS CAR BETTER - MORE VISIBILITY, SIMILAR POWER, MORE REAR SEAT LEGROOM."
"04 29, 2019","Reliable, Economical",Good visibility for the driver.  A little noisy.   Zero problems.   I have 45000 miles on it.  It would be better with fabrics that would be easier to clean.
"04 21, 2019",I had a 2008 rav4 bought it used,"Bought a used 2008 Toyota RAV4 in 2010 with 50000 miles on it drove to 160000 miles on it. It is by far the best and trouble free suv I have ever owned. Never did It leave me stranded on the road although I got stuck in a storm in buffalo and couldn’t see a thing , this suv drove me to the hotel with inches of snow. If it was any other suv I would have probably been stranded on the highway. Overall all the years of owning just did oil changes and routine Maintainance. Sometimes did oil changes after 7000 miles and car just ran forever. In deep snow the all wheel drive system is not the best but I used snow tires and never really had a problem. Way to go rav4 it’s the best car."
"04  9, 2019",The most reliable vehicle I've ever owned! LOVE!!,"Friends & family love this car! Drives like  8 cylinder, luxurious ride,  and plenty of room for passengers, luggage, etc.  I love driving this gem!"
"03 29, 2019",Recommend or Not Recommend,"So far so Good. This car has room for my legs and plenty of power for a 4 cyl.
It drives nice and has a smooth comfort ride to it."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota Dependability 5 stars,"Purchased a used 2013 awd Rv4 limited with 43K,now has 55K,not 1 issue,AWD great for our winters in Buffalo,peppy enuf,decent gas mileage,handles well,comfortable ride for a small suv,has all the amenities,2 minor Quips,the info screen is useless in sunlight,cant see the info at all,and,for a top of the line limited the door lock switches,window switches etc are not lit at night,come on toyota talk about cheaping out,all in all a great vehicle."
"02 17, 2019",Another great example of a high quality Toyota,"Excellent value and utility in a variety of uses

Very reliable  and stable on the road

Huge amount of flexible space 

My second RAV- drove the prior one for 9 years and over 90000 miles"
"02 16, 2019",Toyota Blizxard Pearl paint chips!  Buyer BEWARE,"I love my car.  However the paint is peeling like crazy. Toyota knows of the issue and refuses to do anything about it. Research the paint before you buy. I cannot even have my car detailed without losing huge chunks of paint! Blizzard Pearl Paint cannot even stick to the primer, the entire car has to be stripped, sanded, and painted with different everything.  #Toyotapaintpeels"
"01 31, 2019",Nice car,Very nice car.  It is very comfortable.  I am impressed with the ride quality.  The heater worked wonderfully.  Visibility is fantastic.  I am happy with the safety rating of the car as well.
"01 24, 2019",Good car for the money,My only complaint is too much road noise.  Good mileage. Great handling in any weather conditions.  Wonderful dealership.  Have had no problems other than  only needed a new battery after 5 years
"12  1, 2018","I liked the RAV4 so much, I bought it.","I drove a hr to test drive a Toyota RAV4. I liked it so much, I ended up buying it. It was definitely worth it."
"11 22, 2018",very reliable,"My second Rav4. Very reliable, economical, tons of room in the back. Peppy, reasonably quiet, shifts like a dream and will tow my 15' A-liner trailer!"
"11 20, 2018",Most reliable car ever .,"This car is comfortable and friendly for owner.Is very fast , light and nice .to driver.I can recommend these car for all futures  buyers.
I love him."
"11 17, 2018",Great all around car!,"This car is great for so many different situations that you need it for. It holds 5 people, cabin is very roomy(more than my old midsize suv), gets good fuel economy, and is reliable. The base sound system is amazing considering it isn?t upgraded or anything. It could have a little more power on the highway but otherwise performance is good and ride comfort is fine. It?s just a good average all around suv."
"11 13, 2018",Finally a Toyota Owner and I could not be happier!,"I had a small SUV for a few years that turned out to be a lemon and was on the hunt for a new or used small SUV. My family has long been a fan of Toyotas but I've never owned one. After lengthy research by myself and my husband we found a great price on a used RAV4 and went for a test drive. I was skeptical about having a 4 cylinder vehicle again after years of driving an Accord but I was super impressed with the way the RAV4 drove. I love the safety features (blind spot monitor, back up camera and side curtain airbags) and since I have the Limited package the leather and upgraded stereo made the car even more appealing. I've been averaging around 27mpg which is 6 better than my old car and really enjoy driving again. I have a 35 minute commute to work one way and this small SUV has been great. I'm anxious to see how it fares with an Ohio winter. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone looking to purchase a small SUV. It has a real transmission (unlike many other in its class) and the safety features are top notch."
"11  7, 2018",Good car,Nice vehicle. 4 cyl is surprisingly sprightly for a naturally aspirated engine. AWD in a small SUV was just what I needed. Should be reliable.
"10 28, 2018",Awesome Car,"Great vehicle, service records were available. Salesman Steve Groves was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. Great sales team & showroom. Service folks were nice as well."
"10 10, 2018",Very happy with the Toyota Rav4.,"Excellant warranty.   Covered tourque converter even though the veh.
was several months past the 5 yr warranty.   That was the only problem that I ever had with the veh.  Very dependable;  comfortable, and great gas milage.   Just bought a new 2018 Toyota Rav5 to replace this one."
"10  5, 2018",Reliable & versatile,"We have owned all Toyota models (except carolla).
They, over the years have proven to be extremely reliable, long lasting & have great resale value. 
After owning a 1995 RAV, 2013 Redesign appears to be larger than older models. Ride & seats are very comfortable."
"07 25, 2018",Amazing Car for a Reasonable Price,Wanted a reliable car that was perfect for all the seasons that Colorado has to offer and my Rav4 is a perfect fit. A sleek interior and bluetooth radio lets your drive in style.

"03 30, 2018",Love it,"I've had it for almost 5 years now, and still really enjoy it. Over-all, most reliable car I've ever owned.  Other than a cracked front window from a stone chip, the only think I've done on this car is oil changes. Built so well!"
"03 23, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"This car is perfect for me.  I'm short and not all cars fit very well for short people.. But this rav4 is great.. Wonderful gas milage,  very comfortable,  and roomie my husband is tall and it works for him too..."

"01 29, 2018",Like driving chocolate. Smooth and silky.,"I have been driving a Subaru for the last few years I loved it, but wanted a small SUV that sat a little higher and had less miles. I found my 2013 Toyota Rav4  on car gurus. I love it!. The exterior styling is sleek and inside, luxurious. The back up camera is so helpful, as is the Bluetooth. And who doesn't love a moon roof!!. I'm looking forward to many adventures in my new Toyota."
"01 13, 2018",Love my Rav!!,This SUV is great. I love the all wheel drive and my back seat bench seating. The back seat is adjustable for you to lay back which is awesome! Lots of trunk space. I've had my 2013 RAV4 limited for 5 years
"01  8, 2018","This is my 2nd RAV4, both bought new.",My title says it all... it's one of my best investment made. Best value for the money and reliability and quality.
"12 10, 2017",My favorite Car of ALL Time,"I love my Rav4. The car far exceeds my expectations and the mileage advertised by Toyota. On my recent trip to Atlantic City, I was able to get well over 35 mpg on straight highway driving. I have plenty of room in the trunk for my folding bike plus luggage. The seating is comfortable and the way they are designed, they hold you on sharp curves."
"12  1, 2017",Good car,"The car has met my needs, but I preferred my Mitsubishi Outlander for perks. It drives well, but I had to replace tires at under 30,000 miles and warranty had just expired because it was already over 3 years old."
"11 27, 2017",Love the exterior of our Rav 4,We love our Rav 4 lots of room like all the extras included in our purchase we have always owned a Toyota  along with our grown children who also own Toyotas.
"11 21, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"This is my second RAV4, you can't go wrong with them... Toyota makes a good product and although you're going to pay more upfront, in the long run you'll have saved as maintenance is minimal cause they're built to last. I spent next to nothing in my last one compared to some and I had it a little over 10 yrs. Great Mid size SUV, sporty and fun to drive, absolutely love mine."
"11 15, 2017",Crashed,"I was T boned directly into the drivers door/front tire from a CRV traveling over 55mph.  Every airbag deployed as I spun multiple times, ending up off the road down in a field.  I climbed out of the passengers side with only a limp.  I am thankful every safety feature of this Toyota protected me."
"11  4, 2017",$2 BILL,Fun driving spacious vehicle where I can carry bowling xxxxx and golf clubs without having to take one or the out of the car...
"10 22, 2017",The best car I have owned,"Toyota's are my favorite male of cars. My first was a Camry that went far beyond 200k miles. My favorite model years ago was my Avalon, again going over 200 k miles. My next car was Camry which at 200k mi was given to a young couple needing a car 2 years ago and it is still a smooth ride. I now own the BEST car I have ever owned, a Rav4. I bought a 2013 fully loaded car 1 1/2 yrs ago.  It is great on gas. It drives smoothly and the all wheel drive was exceptional last winter."
"10 22, 2017",Most comfortable and reliable car I've owned.,"This car makes hauling anything very easy. Very spacious, and comfortable to ride in. This car has been extremely reliable since the day I got it. I have a 45 minute commute to work every day and this car makes the time fly by with its AUX chord plug in option, and smooth riding experience."
"10 18, 2017",Most super performance car I owned,"This is my first car ever and never regretted my decision of buying it. Its very comfortable, good mileage, less maintenance issues and great for long drives. Never got a back pain even with ling drives and hill drives."

"08 23, 2017",This is my first Toyota and I love it!!,I love the RAV4 and how it handles! There's nothing I don't like about it! I will always and forever buy Toyotas from now on!
"08 17, 2017",Is the best and most reliable vehicle ever,"These has met all my needs, its easy to transport my family,entertainment is enhanced,it is cormfotable in terms of seats,wheels are okay and more other features."
"08  7, 2017",Beautiful on the outside; could use more on the in,Looks great; drives well. Can't get past the fact the fact that this car does not have a bin for my sunglasses inside. Bought this after owning a 2006 Sienna XLE Limited and am disappointed that the 2013 RAV4 is not even half as luxurious as concerns inside storage space and smooth ride
"08  2, 2017","dependable, great for an SUV, just not what I want","I purchased this SUV w the thoughts of needing cargo space .... practicality, but my heart is in need of a convertible w some punch..... prev owned toyota convertible, the back up camera in my Rav & bluetooth are both great extras, sharp but seems this model is similar to several other SUVs produced @ this time, would like better if had unique look separating from others designs overall though drives well & is dependable.... Toyota does seem to offer more ""extras"" for the $ also"
"07 16, 2017",Extremely Reliable Care!,"The Toyota Rav4 is an exceptional car for my money. The 2.5L DOHC 4 Cyl Engine puts out a healthy 275hp and 172lb-ft of torque. Plenty of pep as well as great gas mileage. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! If you're looking a great crossover SUV, put this one on your list to test drive."
"07 10, 2017",Great Mid-Size Car,"Bought this car just before starting our family.  We really wanted something safe, reliable, and had a good amount of space without being too big.  This fit the bill, we love this Rav4!  It also does great in snow and off road which is a good plus for us."
"07  9, 2017",RAV4 super car,"WOW.... This is one gorgeous RAV.... Loaded with features and options, backed by Toyota, this is a must have. Not only is the color amazing, the ride is awesome, and the comfort is top notch"
"07  6, 2017",Reliable and Efficient Car,"I used to drive Sedan, and getting into SUV has given me a what I was looking for, specifically more space for my children which served as family car for short and long trips."
"06 29, 2017",Very good on gas and very comfortable.,Love the color of interior. Best comfort on our trips we have taken. 28-30 miles to gallon on trips. I would buy another one when needed.
"06 28, 2017",Great pickup for a 4 cylinder,"I bought this 2013 vehicle new, currently have 64k miles on it, and have enjoyed driving it. It has great pickup, which helps in quick passing in tight spots. It is comfy (of course I'm not a tall/big person). I've had to date no major service issues."
"06 11, 2017",Comfortable ride!,"I really liked my Toyota Rav4. It was a great size for someone who doesn't love large SUV's but wants some cargo space, or has a family. The car was very reliable, and drove awesome. I did feel like it had some slight issues in snow (after further research realized it was probably just my model) driving, and heavy rain. The weight distribution was slightly off, and the back end would slide slightly. Still loved the car, and would totally recommend!"
"06  5, 2017",Is my 2nd Toyota.  They do it right.,"When I test drove this previously owned SUV, I realized there have been many advances in features I have missed.  My Rav 4 is such a pleasure to drive."
"06  1, 2017",Cant recommend it,"I bought this RAV4 to replace my F150. I had F150s for over 20 yrs and they just got too big for my needs, enter the RAV. The car did everything I wanted except for the comfort of the seats, after 20 mins I would get pain in the back of my legs regardless of how I positioned the seat, I could vary it a bit but never eliminate the pain and discomfort. I put 25,000 miles a year on this car so I can speak with good authority on these below average seats. It doesn't present in the test drive but on longer drives its torture. The F-150s are all day long comfortable as is the Subaru Outback that replaced this RAV4. Toyota made a nice vehicle with the RAV that suits the needs of many consumers but failed in the driver/car interface in epic fashion. The Nissan Murano outclasses the RAV by light years in seat comfort.  BEWARE if you are shopping a RAV4 try a Nissan, Subaru... see how the seat feels and think long and hard before getting that RAV. Other than that it was very good in all other areas but lets face it, if you dread even short trips in your car it doesn't matter what else it does, it has to meet a minimum comfort level and the RAV 4 does not, not even close."
"05 16, 2017",Best vehicle purchase ever!,"I only wished I'd gotten remote open/close on the door of the storage area. Seats let down for more storage space and when I open my sunroof, I'm in a sports vehicle. The sound system is awesome. I'm not a soccer mom, just like the room and the idea of having space for everything when needed. This is such a cool vehicle to drive, some knee discomfort; and as we all know, Toyota is a mainstay of reliability! One thing, the driver's seat leg room, distance between the seat and the accelerator/brake is a little uncomfortable for me, I try adjusting the seat to different positions but to no avail, smh.  This is causing my right knee to ache, be uncomfortable."
"05  5, 2017",Just what I needed!,"The model I got is not as ""glitzy"" as some SUVs, however, that's really not what I was looking for in a vehicle. I need decent leg room for a tall husband, and the RAV4 provides plenty. Gas mileage is definitely a selling point, as is the reliability typically associated with Toyota. The outside looks impressive and sleek, but I do think that the inside could use a bit more refinement. Turning and overall ride were tight and smooth. It's perfect for carting the family!"
"03 30, 2017",You want one,"The newer rav4 is a great small SUV for everyday use with lots of space for the random times you need it. I love the laws.  I say best small suv, out there and plus it doesn't look like a bubble!"
"03 28, 2017",Toyota Rav 4,"I really really love this vehicle. I went from driving a Nissan Sentra 2003 to a 2013 Rav 4  so this is quite  the upgrade. So far I have no complaints with the car besides a leaking sunroof. I'm not really sure why that is (I haven't looked into yet) but I went for a touchless car wash and the entire front interior of my car got wet. In terms of driving performance, it's a very smooth and comfortable ride. You won't even know when you hit 120 km/h but it does get slightly noisy when you do. In terms of gas, it's not as great as I thought it would be even on eco mode, but it's still quite good. For an SUV it definitely drives like a regular Sports car and doesn't take up space when parking. Overall, I'd say it's one of those vehicles that make you find reasons to drive. :)"
"03 27, 2017",Bought a Rav4,"Great deal, good service from BigM Chevrolet in Radcliff, Ky. 
 Ask for sales rep Tiffany Frizzell."
"03 25, 2017",Great SUV!,"I just bought a 2013 Rav4 Limited a week ago, and I am LOVING it! It is so comfortable and surprisingly roomy. All the safety features are fantastic, I feel like my family is much more protected. It has so many options that make it fun to drive."
"03 22, 2017",I just bought it,"I just bought the car about a week ago. The rear window wiper needed to be replaced (20k miles). Other than that...everything great so far. Very good gas mileage, comfortable ride, lots of space, and drives well in snow"
"03 22, 2017",The newest car i ever owned,i LUV THIS CAR IT DRIVES SO NICE AND IS COMFY. Has alot of gadgets i never knew came on a car. It quite and drives like a dream
"03 21, 2017",Overall very reliable car,Great vehicle Great gas mileage and comfortable interior. It is very good in the winter weather. Dealership always excellent with service.
"03 17, 2017",The car I needed most,I never expect that this car is so big inside. Its a suv that i never expect im gonna get but its good on gas
"03 16, 2017",Dima was Amazing,"I had an amazing experience with Dima. He provided amazing customer service, i loved the service he provided !"
"03 11, 2017",best car ever!,"I love my Rav4, second one I have purchased! Always reliable, they are comfortable, economical and you can use it for almost anything! They are the best!"
"02 18, 2017",Rav Too...,Purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Rav4 Limited and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love this vehicle. Truth be told I sure see a huge difference between this and the 2003 Rav4 L that I previously had. Way bigger way more powerful way more room and tons quieter. Not sure why people complain about noise because mine is ultra quiet. For starters tires are very important. Mine came with noncheap Cooper CS3  all Season Touring tires that are so smooth and quiet and handle great. The design is sexy and upscale. I do agree with those that mention the door extensions and yes they do tend to collect dirt and snow. I really don't let that dampen my spirits. Overall I Really Love my Rav4 Limited. In Silver metallic it's really HOT....
"01 27, 2017",Not what I expected from Toyota,"2013 rav 4 Limited needed a tourque converter with 40,000 miles then a new transmission at 49,000 and still has no pick up. Overall worse purchase of my life! So disappointed and will no longer purchase any type of a Toyota"
"03 26, 2016",Great Reliable Car for the Money!,"We purchased a used 2013 Toyota Rav4 XLE roughly a month ago with about 40,000 miles, and while this vehicle has it's drawbacks in areas, most of them I can live with. My previous vehicle was a 99 Toyota Tacoma with manual transmission. In comparison the Rav4 drives and rides like a dream. I will say that it does have a stiff ride to it, which seems to be a common complaint, but I still find it to be a fairly comfortable overall. I'm mostly a city driver and don't think I would be doing much off-roading with this vehicle. Mostly just wanted something that would handle well in the winter. I love that the rear seats recline, which is a nice feature for passengers in the vehicle. The cars computer system is a little clunky, and the interface could be a little more user friendly. I had a few issues with keeping my phone connected via bluetooth, but a quick internet search and updating the cars firmware quickly resolved those issues. The usb plug and play feature for music is nice. Put your music on a jump drive and play it directly through the audio system. We actually put all our music on an old hard drive we had laying around and plugged it in through a usb cable, so I have my whole library in the car wherever we go. The voice command does not work terribly well and often misinterprets or cannot understand what you are saying to it. Not a huge deal as I find this to be a useless feature on most devices, such as my cell phone. It works well for dialing numbers and answering phone calls, which is all I really need it to do anyway. Navigation voice command is touch and go. Beware that this vehicle takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.The trade off is you only have to change it every 10,000 miles, so that will likely save you money overall as it's basically three oil changes in one. There is a noticeable difference between the Eco, Standard, and Sport mode (although very slight). I found that I actually get the same mileage in Standard mode that I do in Eco mode, but Eco has less power when you're driving and accelerating. I'm not terribly aggressive on the peddle though. Sport mode does eat up a little bit of the MPG, but the vehicle seems to be more responsive. 95% of the time I just leave it in standard mode. Gets about 29 MPG with mixed highway and city driving, which is the sticker MPG. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but I'm fairly certain I could get between 30-32 MPG. The gas tank is listed at almost 16 gal, but I've yet to get more than 13 into the tank when the vehicle gas warning light first comes on. It's possible that there are another 3 gallons of fuel in there, I guess you wouldn't know until you actually ran the vehicle out of fuel. I love the back up cam, which is a nice standard feature to have for those city parking situations. Overall I'm am happy with the Rav4 thus far. We bought it for more passenger room and Toyota's reliability. Time will tell. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy one."
"03 23, 2016",Great Compact Crossver,"We have owned four Jeeps and got tired of the high cost of maintenance. We bought it as a Toyota Certified vehicle, it is extraordinarily good. We've owned it for three months and taken it into the mountains in snow, across the desert, and on 2-4 day cross country interstate trips from the Mojave to the Rockies and back. It's a keeper. It has three modes eco, regular and sport, and a very intelligent AWD system. Handles well, very comfortable, and while it does not have the ground clearance of a Jeep, we are extremely pleased with our purchase."
"03 22, 2016",Not at all impressed,"We bought our 2013 Rav4 new 3 years ago. We currently have 58,000 miles on it. There are 5 parking lot dings on the doors due to extremely thin metal. The ride is very rough, even with new tires, it is noisy on the highway. The canister oil filter is a real pain to replace....had to buy a special wrench from Toyota(expensive) and is almost worn out after 6 oil changes. The backup lights are very weak and hardly provide enough light when backing up. I really dislike the touch screen to change radio stations or other activities. In daylight you cannot see the screen. The Rav is missing numerous convenience storage spaces. Poor design overall, a elementary student could have given Toyota engineers better advise. Will be buying a CRV in near future...Very disappointed."
"06 29, 2015",Road noise and Yokahama tires,"I ha d 31 X 10.50 tires on my 94 pick-up that were quieter than the Yokohamas that came on my 2013 RAV4 XLE. These tires are the noisiest I ever owned with the exception of a set of Generals. When I hit even slightly rough road these tire are so loud I can't even hear the radio. Get a set a set of Michelin's as fast as you can.
The only other problem is that the large side panels are easily marred in parking lots. The vehicle needs side bumpers so that it doesn't look beat up in a very few years.
I fixed the glare on the interior backup screen by cutting a stiff piece of thin foam board around the top and sides. It isn't pretty but serves it's purpose.
All else considered I get great mileage 32.3 and putting it in sport mode to merge on the interstate is a thrill for the day. A very good vehicle that I would recommend, I'm still a Toyota fan just wish it came with quieter tires."
"05  6, 2015",Love. This. Vehicle!,"I just purchased my new (used) Rav 4 and I love it! It corners like it's glued to the road. The drive is so comfortable and even my 6' 2"" husband can sit very comfortably in the back seat! It's a dream."
"02 11, 2015",Enjoying the RAV4 Limited,"I've been very impressed with the vehicle so far. I came from an Acura RDX, which cost considerably more, but didn't offer any more features than the RAV4 Limited - and guzzled premium gas at 20 mpg. Although the Acura was more powerful, the RAV has plenty of pickup for all daily and highway driving. Pop it into Sport mode, and you get even quicker acceleration; or maximize your mileage in Eco mode - I average 25 mpg (about 60% city). I tested this SUV against the Mazda CX-5: although the Mazda may have been slightly sportier to drive (but not much), it fell way short of the RAV4 inside. The RAV is much more comfortable, roomy, and has all the luxury features (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) that the RDX had. I love the two-tone Terra Cotta interior. On the road, the ride is a nice balance between firm and shock-absorbing; it's not a Lexus, but it's quiet enough to make hands-free calls or listen to music (without blasting), and it handles all bumps smoothly. The sound system is quite good, and the navigation is adequate, though it has trouble finding points of interest. At 23,000 miles, I've had only two very minor issues: the rear hatch auto-opening mechanism (which I LOVE) had to be replaced (under warranty) when it failed, and the dashboard has started to rattle/squeak just a little, but only when the weather is below freezing. Unless the car falls apart, I expect to be happy with the RAV for years to come."
"01  9, 2015",Not much to brag about here,"There's not much I can say about the Toyota Rav4 LE except that it's a Toyota... which might mean a lot down the road. But for now, I'm not impressed. In fact, the 2013 Rav4 LE is really more irritating to me than anything else. There are features (or a lack of features) that are downright mystifying. When in park, the car rolls forwards or backwards for a greater distance than any other car I've owned. I haven't a clue why, except be careful that there's nobody behind you or in front of you when you put it in park. Otherwise, their toes might get squished. The plastic panels along the bottom of the front doors allow for all kinds of debris, dirt, snow and grime to enter the car's lower door interior. Again, why? What on earth were the engineers thinking when they added this lower door extension with a plastic shroud? The ""spoiler"" in the back just prevents your car from getting cleaned when in a car wash. Speaking of car washes, if you don't have a roof rack, watch out; the roof rack channel trim has a tendency to ""pop"" lose when going through the car wash's blow dryer. It happened to me twice.Toyota has no recommended solution for this.
I have a black interior. Which makes it extremely difficult to see the door handles and window and door lock buttons in the dark. Buttons are not backlit for the most part when the headlights are on. The auto window feature for the driver's side works when putting the window down -- but why not a one-touch feature for putting the window back up? What's the point of that? Very deceiving are the windshield wipers. On the turn signal, Toyota shows ""INT"" for intermittent wipers. In reality, there's nothing intermittent about the wipers at all. They turn on for slow speed or fast speed. Or not at all. That's it. They are not variable timing wiper blades. What car made today does not have this as a standard feature? This is 20 year old technology. I guess the answer is Toyota. Unbelievable. How cheap can you be? Although the interior looks refined, it's cheap and is prone to scratches and I suspect poor longevity. I had a stain on the silver rim of the air vent. When I went to wip the stain off with my licked finger... the silver paint came off!! Either I have the most caustic saliva known to man or Toyota is using the cheapest silver spray paint in the world. I'm going with the latter. The muffler or tailpipe rattles in idle making it sound like you have an exhaust leak. The brakes squeak when going in reverse. Cheap rotors? The engine is noisy. The undercarriage sound proofing is deafening... deafeningly loud. The heater / AC fan barely blows out anything in positions one and two. The doors feel lightweight and cheap. The salesman said ""Hey, you gotta shave back on something in order to get better mileage."" The transmission is an oxymoron. Why would you need a six speed auto transmission for a 4 cylinder car? How much gas savings can that really bring? As a six speed transmission, it always feels like the car doesn't know what gear to be in. As a driver, I feel like the transmission might go at any minute becauseof the way the transmission behaves. Very perplexing -- and as I said previously, irritating. I could go on and on about the irritating features this car has but I'm winded from complaining. If ten years from now I enjoy a trouble-free experience with this car, I'll overlook its idiosyncrasies, but until then I'm forced to live with these ""irritating"" features."
"10 29, 2014",Lacks basic features,"Toyota has gone cheap on this SUV.
We have the SLE with Nav package. It is very hard to see on a bright day and very limited in information provided.
Back-up camera is next to useless and gets blurred if it is raining.
We spend 5 months a year in the US and our Canadian model has no way to switch from Kilometres to miles also the GPS does not give a speed read out.
There is no DC power outlet for a cooler in the back seat.
We went from a 10 year old SUV to this and don't find it has as many features."
"10 23, 2014",2013 Rav4,"I'm enjoying this car. I've had RAV 4 in the past and I'm having a great time in this one. Added features off the power moonroof, fog lights,led screen miles analysis, control heating and the added 4 wheel drive feature is great. Now I have all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive in the same vehicle. The backup camera is great. The Sport mode and Eco mode also gives 2 options of control. I'm happy finally to get back into a SUV."
"10  3, 2014",Went from a Mustang to the Rav4 and LOVING it!!,"I bought my Rav4 brand new in the end of year sales December 27th and got a great deal on the price. I get 27.3 miles per gallon and I am at times very heavy on the gas. I have put just over 16,000 miles as this is a work vehicle for me and it still runs like the first day!! When I am on the road whether its highway or city the noise is very quiet compared to having a mustang before this!! The inside plastic is a little easy to scratch and I don't like having cloth on the door where you will be touching a lot but its a car not a house. I love the back up camera, cruise control and bluetooth! Three things that don't come standard on all vehicles in its category. This car also does great in very heavy rain where roads are flooded! I wouldn't have even know I was driving on a flooded road if the water wasn't spraying everywhere!! It did GREAT!! I do wish that the windshield wipers had more than slow, fast and faster but its just a pet peeve of mine and I can get over it. Tons of legroom in the back! Love that the back seats recline too! All around this vehicle is great!!"
"09  7, 2014",Wish I had not bought it...,"I waited 7 years for a new vehicle and had my heart set on the Rav-4 or the Honda CRV. We went with the 2013 Rav-4, I loved the look of it. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought it. At the test drive, I noticed all of the hard plastic inside, but did not realize how cheap it made the interior. Within 4 weeks we had an issue with the driver's door. We were told the ""welds"" had all come loose and a new door was ordered from Canada. Then parts of the roof rack came off, we went back to the dealer and had that replaced. A month or so later, the same parts came off the roof rack again! We never used the roof rack. My vehicle was white, my 4th white vehicle, under every door handle, under the gas tank door and under the two mirrors, each time it rained, black drip marks went down the entire vehicle at each of these places. Needless to say, at 4200 miles, I was done. I traded the vehicle in. We have a 2000 Toyota Sienna and the quality of that vehicle is so much better than the 2013 Rav-4. The vehicle I had seemed to be cheaply made, and it was not a cheap vehicle. This was our 4th Toyota, it will probably be our last."
"07 20, 2014",2013 Toyota RAV4 XLE,"Might be a little soon for this, but since the car is a 2013 model and it's July 2014 it's probably a good time since I'm now the second owner of this car. I purchased the TRav over the 4th of July just before my vacation to the ocean. After a 3 hour drive there, local Ocean City driving, and 3 hours back, I'm puzzled as to why the previous owner didn't keep the vehicle. Fun to drive; carried hubby and three teens around for a week or so and no complaints. Hubby has mostly all positive things to say also. Plenty of rear seat leg room and storage in the rear, and boy did we have it loaded down. Tks Toyota for the large side mirrors. Whoever thought of their size considered people like us that have the rear stuffed to the roof and no rear view mirror visibility. I was able to compensate just fine, and plan to purchase a roof rack. Believe me this isn't a knock to the TRav, but just an idea of what we packed. ENGINE: Performance for a 4-banger is excellent. There's enough engine and transmission options (ECO boost, Sport, and the neat Standard/Auto shifting) to make me feel that I've got enough options for all driving situations, and believe me I've used them so far. It's got some serious pep and delivers quickly. Gas mileage appears to be as advertised, but I'll probably be able to extend that carpooling back and forth from work since it's mostly highway. Soooo much better than my previous vehicle. TECHNOLOGY: Ok, this will be short from me since that wasn't much of a concern during purchase (Yeah, I'm in my early 50s - it shows). Love the back up camera, awesome bluetooth, excellent audio system, and hookups for iPODs, teenager gizmos, etc. Did I mention I love the bluetooth. Never thought I'd hear myself say that. ISSUES: Lack of lumbar support for cloth seats - Hubby has back issues so he's sensitive about this. See light color under scratches in red paint, but I plan to touch up and I'm very good at that sort of thing, so don't expect it to be a big problem. 4 stars for value for the money and reliability since that would depend on how trouble free the Rav will be in the future. Given the history of the Rav I'm hoping it will warrant 5 stars in a couple of years :) Additional PLUSES: Love how Toyota has the bottom of the body covered with the plastic and integrated into the bumpers. Figure I'll need that additional protection if we have another winter full of Polar Vortexes. Thought the dash design (bump out area to the glove box) was a bit odd at first, but after traveling around I've warmed up to it because it makes fiddling with the buttons easier. Lot's of additional hidden storage for tools and space around the spare tire for additional things. I'm a chick that likes her tools. All in all, I'm very happy with this vehicle and would recommend to a friend. Almost seems as though it was made just for me :)"
"06 24, 2014",Average vehicle,"We had a 2007 highlander, great car was a hybrid and got 28mpg consistently. The 2013 Rav 4 has great looks but it stops there. It's noisy, clunky ride and worst of all overstated mileage by toyota. We have coasted, drove flat roads, been very light on the gas and the best we get is 24.1 on highway and 22.4 in town in easy suburban driving. Had 4 toyotas, 2 highlanders, camray and this is the most disappointing mileage. Would not recommend."
"05  9, 2014",Average at best,"I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is ""average"". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average. Not a bad car, but easily outclassed by several competitors in its class."
"05  3, 2014",2013 Rav4,"Had an awesome experience purchasing my very first brand new car. I worked with Umesh, who helped me find the car I wanted withing my budget."
"05  1, 2014",I love it more every day!,"I've owned by RAV4 LE for 6 months. We had lots of snow this winter. The RAV always made me feel comfortable that I had good control of the vehicle. The windshield wipers and defrost work well. The gas mileage as calculated by the onboard computer says I've averaged 27.2 miles per gallon over the first 5400 miles. My manual calculation has it at 25.1mpg. I drive around with it in eco mode most of the time. When I'm in a passing or merging situation I reach over and press the sport mode button. The transmission will immediately drop 1 to 2 gears depending on my timing with the gas pedal. I love that button. The paddle shifting option doesn't work as fast. I'm 54, my 22 year old son agrees that the sport button works best when you are mostly operating in eco mode. The low load floor with no lip and lift gate rear make loading and unloading super easy. I'm not a super tech geek, so not having the GPS or blind spot sensors, found on the more expensive models, doesn't cause me any regret. I do like the back up camera. The side mirrors are large and well placed for backing up. My first car was a 1967 Dodge Coronet with shoulders that the RAV4 also tastefully incorporates. Great visibility, very strong cornering ability (this is not a sports car), good options for controlling the acceleration vs mpg, plenty of useful space, all come together to keep me smiling. The one area that I wish it were just a bit better is the left foot rest for the driver. That is a bit small and angled wrong for me."
"04 30, 2014",2013 Rav 4 Ltd.,"Outstanding vehicle in every respect. We would highly recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, economical and fun car."
"04 19, 2014",What a neat car,"WE bought our 2013 Rav4 Limited in November 2013. We were originally there to replace our tires on our 2010 Corolla and something catches our eye in the dealership. The Rav4 had the most compelling exterior design from the chrome in the headlamps to the ""rest-your arm"" on the rear-tail light. It was quite a change from the previous generation and it has grown on us. We decided to test drive a gray colored one. The ride wasn't too bad (but we own a rough-riding sports car so we are used to some bumps) but Toyota probably made it a little firm for handling purposes. The road noise was pretty minimal and when you opened the sunroof at 50+ mph, it was a little noisy. What REALLY made up our minds to buy the car were the immense amounts of technological features that it came with. Push button start with easy door-unlocking/locking, auto-dimming rearview mirror (this is great for that annoying headlight glare during the night), the great navigation unit, the blind spot monitor system with back up assist (although we wished the blind spot monitor made a noise when you tried to change lanes into another car), the vast amount of rear cargo space, the heated seats, the high driving position, and the bluetooth connectivity. I know that was a long list, but it was totally worth mentioning because it makes this car 100 times better than base models. The only problem we had since we bought the car was the power lift gate. Here in Florida we have lots of rainstorms. Water managed to get into the power lift mechanism in the gate and caused it to have a terrible squeak aw it went up. Fortunately toyota replaced it for free and it hasn't squeaked since. I use the car daily and gas mileage could be a little better. I know its rated around 26/31 but i feel like I've been getting a little worse, maybe 22/27. The transmission can be pretty smooth but if you been in a rodeo, the chassy seems to heave and ho upon acceleration. Its not the smoothest but its do-able. Rear leg room and head roof is plenty (I'm 6'0 and i fit perfectly fine behind my driving position. The two-toned leatherette seats are comfy but seem to wrinkle a little because the seat bolsters are in the way when getting in the car, so you are rubbing against it all the time. The eco mode has terrible acceleration but that's to save gas; the sport mode is peppy and good for fast-er accelerations and overtaking on highways, however, this accounts for poor gas mileage. I use normal mode for city driving. Overall, the Rav4 is a great deal with all the features it has. A bang for your buck. I would recommend it for families that want to take a nice cross-country road trip or those who use it to commute to work. Toyota truly lives up to their slogan with this car ""Let's go places""."
"04  1, 2014",Thankfully I don't do a lot of driving...,"I drove a 2009 Rav4 LE for almost 5 years and absolutely loved it. Now that I have the new 2013 Rav4 LE, I find myself wishing at times that I still had my old one...

I was given a brand new, 15 miles on the odometer, 2013 Rav4 from the dealership just over 2 months ago. I definitely like the interior more than the 2009 version with the back up camera, touch screen display, bluetooth, etc., but I also miss a couple of the old features too. I feel like there's less storageup front and the extrerior tends to scratch very easily. A lot of plastic additions and kind of silly to see fake plastic parts where lights would go on a higher edition. I don't have a far commute to work, so my gas mileage has been pretty decent, but I've never felt 100% comfortable in the car. I didn't even get off the lot yet, before turning the car around to ask why the brakes were making noise -- I was told they had to be ""broken in"" because it was sitting on the lot for so long. Brought the car back 4 days later because the bluetooth wasn't working correctly. I was told by 2 different people (including a specialist) that they didn't know how to fix it and I needed to bring it in for service.

Fast forward 2 months and the car has less than 2,000 miles on it. Not only does the transmission and acceleration make me nervous -- down shifts very quickly and has ""jumped"" forward on a couple occassions when putting the car into reverse. The engine has also been making a ""squealing/whining"" noise since I first got it when driving below 45mph and has a difficult time driving up hill. I've had to put my foot almost to the floor for it to accelerate. I plan on bringing the car in for service in the next couple of weeks and make note of these problems.

My 2009 Rav NEVER had a problem in the 4+ years that I had it. No engine noise, comfortable, no leaks, etc. I loved that car...this new one, is not so impressive. I think Toyota is a great car, but I'll think twice about getting another Rav4 once my lease is up in 3 years."
"02 14, 2014","Oh Hello, Space Ship.","First of all, I traded in my base-model chevy coupe for my next car, so anything I purchased would far surpass it. However, the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited was the best vehicle I test drove.

Having automatic-everything for the first time worried me a bit. The more electronics in the car, the more expensive it is to fix. Since it's a lease, I'm not too concerned with this issue. I especially like that I get the opportunity to replace my key fabs twice a year if anything happens to them.

I love everything about this car, especially the Blind Spot Monitor. I didn't think I would notice the light signals in the mirrors, but the sales guy, Brian Dobbs, convinced me to get it. It proved its worth within the first week of purchasing the Rav4.

PROS: Two Power Seat Setting buttons for the driver side so both me and a second person can switch back and forth in the driver side seat with ease. Seat Warmers, All-Wheel Drive. I love how the inside lights turn on when I walk up to the car. I flipped out the first night I witnessed it. I can connect my phone via bluetooth and use the car speakers to make phone calls (super plus!). The sound quality of the phone conversation isn't bad either. It gets good mileage, almost the same as my old coupe.

CONS: I thought it was strange that there aren't rear vents for the back passengers. Since I don't drive people around on a frequent basis, I'm not sure how this affects their experience. I also think it's odd that the middle cup holders for the back passengers are inside the center arm rest. If three people sit in the back, the middle person has to hold their drink. Again, this doesn't affect my experience with the car."
"02 13, 2014",2013 rav4 diesel,"We are the proud owners of a new rav diesel and I am pleased to say that that it is a delight to drive our trip from the dealers to home on the freeway averaged 5.5L/100 km and is whisper quite .Cannot fault the fit and finish however some brands like Hyundai put more effort into upholstery detail .We are stepping out of a 2002 s60 volvo and we find the seats to almost as good as the volvo .
It represented a more practical car than a hybrid vehicle .
With the vehicle set on cruise control 100 km/ hour on country roads it was un stoppable having mountains of toque to negotiate steep inclines.."
"02 10, 2014",Enjoying my Rav4 xle,"I have had my Rav4 XLE almost 3 weeks. LOVE IT, fun to drive. I had a Ford Edge and the gas milage was killing me. So happy Toyota changed the style of the exterior."
"02  1, 2014",one of the best car's I have ever owned,"This car is just the right size. Performs very well. I get great gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25 miles per gallon. It handles great in the snow. That is the number one reason I bought the Rav 4. I wanted all wheel drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. from the great sounding radio to the blind spot monitor, the backup screen, and the nav system and of course the Bluetooth for my phone and music. I really like the apps, such as Pandora.

Overall, this is one of the best cars I have ever owned and would recommend it. Toyota's service is second to none and that is extremely important in owning this vehicle."
"01 28, 2014",Hold On,"I have owned my Rav4 for six months and have owned many different cars and trucks in almost
50 years of driving . This is by far the vehicle with
the worst ride I have ever owned."
"01 21, 2014",Great Car,"I love my 2013 rav4 xle. Bought for my wife and wished it was for me. Great mileage and great exterior body. The only negatives is no leather or heated seats. camera works good when it doesn't snow or rain. Love the touchscreen on the dash. very impressed, i'm a honda person and glad i didn't buy crv. I live in Virginia and drive to Kansas and myrtle beach once a year. Drive for fun to D.C., Richmond alot. Love the white paint."
"01  1, 2014",Good car but Toyota cutting corners from earlier m,"I traded in my 2010 Rav4 for the 2013 model so I feel I can make a valid comparison. My 2010 LTD was a V6 so I knew going in that I was giving up excellent acceleration for a s0-so 4 cyl. But when considered against the new features of the 2013 I decided to trade it in. I got tired of the large swing door and lack of technology as found in the newer models. But here's where they cut some corners:
1. The spare tire is now inside (nice) but is no longer a full size tire and wheel but a temp.
2. The 2010 had real leather seats, now they employ something called ""soft-tek"" leather substitute.
3. The center console no longer two levels, just one large box.
4. On the 2010 there was a secondary glove box that had a push button release. Replaced by an open bin.
5. The interior and dashboard use more cheap looking plastic and no one will be fooled into thinking the carbon fiber surface is real.
6. One less 12V outlet and no 110V a/c outlet.

Even with all of the above, I don't regret buying this car. It's a good reliable vehicle with some nice technology. The price is lowest in it's class and the mileage is great. I get 28 mpg overall and it uses regular gas. However, if they brought back the V6 I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"12 22, 2013",You can't Make This Up,"Stranded at the dealership with a Uhaul in tow I asked the Sales guy to take me on a test drive with something comparable to my luxury vehicle which just decided to ""break up with me"". He suggested a Toyota Rav 4 Limited and I laughed saying I don't think so. I wanted comfort, a smooth ride, leather heated seats, auto seat adjustment with memory, navigation, performance with some get up and go. And decent gas mileage. No way was I expecting this in the Rav4 but I was wrong. Words that do not normally come out of my mouth. The Rav4 Limited is Awesome! Great ride, super cool looking, the performance is far beyond what I expected. Hugs the corners, has some power for a 4 Cylinder when in the Sport Mode. Surprising sound system, navigation and voice commend system is very nice and easy to use. Got a lot in this vehicle without the high ticket price of it's well known luxury model that I use to drive. Surprise, surprise. I love my Toyota Rav4 Limited."
"12 18, 2013",Honest Review 2013 RAV4 XLE AWD,"Let me start by saying that this may in fact be the right car for some but I will tell you about my experience with my current RAV4.
We found the Rav4 attractive for numerous reasons. We liked the overall styling of the exterior, though more black plastic than I liked but this seems to be a way for car manufactures to make some extra savings. I worried about it fading over time, which it will. I wasn't a fan of the rear end and I still do not care for it. this wasn't a deal breaker for me because what the exterior lacked the interior made up for it.
You get a lot of standard features on the XLE and that is why we chose it. Automatic Dual climate controls, roof rails, touch scree, back up cam, neat two tone color fabric, and so on.
We compared this to the escape (to small) and the CRV (noisy over the road).
PROs: smooth power train and enough power for the whole family. Me +3. roomy seating for all unless you squeeze 3 in the back. It's REALLY tight with three! Great cargo room even with the stroller. Road noise is minimal for this class compared to the competition. Nice interior and decent exterior.
This is why I'm rating this car so low and I have lost a lot of respect for Toyota quality.
CONS: The fake carbon fiber scratches extremely easy but the Toyota dealership replaced the scratched piece. Pretty nice of them. The ride is absolutely terrible! We did our initial test drive over some pretty smooth roads but once we got to driving it (after purchase) on other less improved surfaces, the ride was very noticeable. I'm pretty sure it's the rear suspension as it crashes over the smallest imperfections. The hood shakes and rattles all the time no matter the speed. There is a ""whine"" noise coming from the transmission when slowing down from 45+ mph. I also have some oil residue developing around the valve cover gasket. Toyota cannot find a leak. The transmission has a hard time on hills. Cruising at 70 mpg and climbing up a grade will case the transmission to downshift very hard once it finally engages. So hard that it woke my sleeping passengers and them asking if we hit something. All of these issues were brought to the dealerships attention and Toyota corporate. After several weeks and the car staying at the dealer for over two weeks, Toyota was unable to identify any problems. They took note of it and agreed with my complaints but say that these are characteristics of this vehicle. TOn top of all this, the bolts to the back hinge struts for the gate are developing rust and it is creating a rust streak down the column. Got to take it back to the dealer for this... yay, yet again.
After all of this I am pursuing the arbitration process and will try to get my money back. I cannot recommend this vehicle to anyone until they address these common issues with this model. Do a quick search or look on the forums and you will find I'm not the only with theses exact same problems.
I hate to say this, because I'm a Toyota fan, but do not buy this vehicle. If you choose to take anyways, PLEASE look for the problems I'm having as many others are experiencing the same. It's not worth it.... even for a Toyota."
"12  7, 2013",Car buying experience on a reliable car,The Toyota scion dealership in Apex NC made my car buying experience really smooth and fast. There was no pressure nor any hidden fees. I am very satisfied with overall experience. I will definitely recommend this place for new car buyers to try it out.
"11 28, 2013",Disappointed new RAV 4 owner,"I purchased a 2013 RAV 4 XLE with great expectations. What attracted me to this car was the exterior styling, well laid out and functional interior, back up camera, six speed automatic transmission, fairly peppy speed especially from the starting position, and good value for the price.

My disappointment has been the rear suspension ""slamming"" when driving over even modest speed bumps and breaks in the road, choppy transmission shifts especially in stop and go driving, loud muffler, and that incessant high pitched winding sound when accelerating that is so common to all Toyotas.

Of course when I asked the dealer to check out these aggravations, they predictably said it was ""normal"".

I previously owned a 2008 Honda CR-V and now wish I went with my gut and purchased a 2013 Honda CR-V.

I hope someone in authority from Toyota reads this review, takes it seriously, and start to make corrections to an otherwise very fine car."
"11 22, 2013","Nicest, and maybe last, car I've owned","RAV4 is roomy, with lots of extras standard; wouldn't have asked for Bluetooth or sun roof, but nice to have. Gas mileage is what Toyota posted, Solid feel, handles fine, peppy enough especially with EcoMode turned off (which we only do to get on the freeway). We drive cars for 10 years & 200,000 miles; hope this car will go at least that long."
"11  9, 2013",great deal,yours to discover this professionals and unbelievable sales representatives and great deal. and great car.
"11  8, 2013",Everything I needed and more,"Rides like a dream, turns on a dime... OK maybe a sliver dollar but tight. Gas mileage was excellent and it handles well in city and Long road trips. Entune is easy to set up and the auto seat settings for each driver is sure handy.

There is one minor disappointment, a nit ... that I've experienced in this superb vehicle - no built in garage door opener/Home Link capability.. Yep!!! Limited package I bought had all upgrades plus the dealer is so confident I received an extra year of No Cost Maintenance. And have we got room to spare. Moved 2 cats and a parrot 1200 miles easily. Get one of your own."
"11  6, 2013",5th Toyota,"I believe that Toyota missed the boat when they designed the interior. I have a 2013 RAV 4 LE with cloth seats. Seats are uncomfortable. The front seat head rests are as hard as a 2X4. They light grey put cloth on the inside of the door panels where ones hand touches every time the door is opened. I can just imagine what it will look like the first time a greasy auto mechanic opens or closes the door. Every time I make a right turn, I change the radio station or go to Bluetooth. The buttons to control the radio are too close to the outside of the steering wheel."
"10 25, 2013",Toyota - What a Joke,"I purchased my 3rd RAV4 this year in June 2013. Driven over 5,000 miles and Toyota you've totally let me down.
Primary uses: Commuting to work, shuttling kids to activities, going on trips to camp, bike, hike and kayak.

Performance:
The ECO mode is a joke - for my driving (mix of country roads, city and hwy) I get better gas mileage in normal mode. One would think going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would get better gas mileage. NOT! Worse gas mileage than my 2010. You would think they would work to improve it not go the other way.
Responsiveness and performance is sluggish at best. When accelerating to get on the highway, constantly have the RPMs at 4 or 5 ? Never had this issue in my old RAV?s. I also drive my mother?s Subaru Forester which drives and handles extremely better than this RAV in ?normal? mode. If you put it in ECO mode it is even worse. Mode (Sport,Eco) Buttons are not convenient and are a safety hazard to switch to Sport mode for those times I have to accelerate fast to merge onto the highway.

Features:
? Satellite is flaky. In my last RAV it worked like a charm and we really enjoyed it, now it cuts in and out. Dealership told me ?that is just the way Satellite works?. Umm, driving the same routes no I don?t think your answer is correct.
? Bluetooth constantly reboots my phone and is unusable. Again the dealership said can?t be the RAV it?s the phone; tried 3 other phones and still does the same thing. Phone company checked phones (Motorola and LG) and said no issues.
? Like the automated hatch, have not had the problems others seem to mention with piston failure.
? Rearview camera is the bomb.

Exterior Styling:
? Good copy of Mazda and Hyundai and others. No originality. Have gone from leader of the pack to follower.
? Can't believe the paint has mildewed!

Interior Styling:
? TOTALLY miss the storage compartment that was taken away to house the spare tire. Must less functional storage capability. Used this feature a lot in my old RAV to store chairs, purchases, etc.
? Miss the additional plugs behind the console for the rear seat and in the rear of the vehicle.
? Some controls are easy to reach for my short arms, others are hidden or hard to reach.
? Overall feels downgraded.

Value for the Money:
Should have gone with Subaru or Mazda. Looking to trade it in for another vehicle."
"10 23, 2013",Toyota's-all,"I have had several Toyota cars and pickup and they have all been good.

I do wish you had kept the swing door, much easier to open for a women or make all of them with power tailgate"
"10 20, 2013",I'm lovin' it,"I like the feel of the size of RAV, the finish is outstanding , the navigation and the entertainment systems CONS:difficult to read the gauges especially outside temp (passengers like to know the temp as well )Heated seats do not have variable settings."
"10 14, 2013",2014 RAV4 - The Best Car ... so far,"I purchased a Rav4 in March 2013 - I love It! I previously owned a Nissan, and 2 Honda Civics; but so far this is the best. My only concern is I am not seeing the Metallic Green on the color chart;... is it that they are not making it any longer...?"
"10  7, 2013",2013 Toyota Rav4! Fun to drive!,"Hello, having driven a 2005 Nissan Maxima for nearly 9 years and 215K+ miles, it was time to move to a something different. I knew that I was tired of driving a sedan and wanted something with solid gas mileage, stylish, fun to drive yet sat higher up than I was use to. Enter the 2013 Rav4.

What a great little SUV. It's a head turner, believe it or not. Gets great gas mileage, has a smooth ride, is very fun to drive and has lots of room for all types of things. Sorry for the short review, but i highly recommend it."
"10  5, 2013",moving from a Camry to RAV4,"I am enjoying the RAV4, Only one problem and that it is cuts out occasionally so I will have to take it back to a dealer to have that item checked. Dealer Bountiful Toyota, was excellent in every way. Friendly, efficient and wanted to meet my needs in a car."
"09 25, 2013",Broke 6 days after purchase,"This is my third Toyota vehicle.
I had been a long believer of Toyota quality until now.
I had all my maintenance and services done at Toyota on my previous vehicles and have the stamp book to prove it.

It had been less than a week since I purchased my 2013 RAV4 and took it off the lot

I was unloading the trunk when the hatch fell on me.
The right arm holding the hatch came straight off the door and took some paint with it on the way down.

I know I am not the only 2013 RAV4 owner with this issue because there are several online forums that mention this.
I also know there is an updated version of the piston for the hatch available.

I have been in contact with the dealer and Toyota to get the car fixed.The dealer took the defective piston, compressed it, and put it right back onto the hatch.They didn't put the updated pistons on or even a new one.

Toyota also stated that they will not replace the defective piston unless they issue a recall. They said I will have to wait until it breaks again.

The 2013 RAV4 is a nice looking car, but Toyota customer service and quality have fallen a long way."
"09 24, 2013",Fun to Drive,"I was worried about the 4 cylinder, but this car has some spunk. I really enjoy driving it. It has a ""Sport"" button when you want to waste gas and an ""Eco"" button for when you want to save gas. Who could ask for more? Steering feels good, too. I think I made a good decision.

I haven't had it very long, so reliability is based on Toyota's pedigree."
"09 24, 2013",Not Powerful Enough,"The 4-cylinder engine in the new Rav4 is way too small. Why did Toyota do away with the 6? Highway driving is difficult as there's not nearly enough power. The new design also gives this vehicle a very cheap feel. I used to have a 2010 Rav4 with the V6, and this new one is about five steps down! Yes, you will get Toyota reliability, but that's about it. If you liked the wood panneled station wagons in the 80s, then you will love the new Rav4."
"09 23, 2013",This 2014 RAV 4 model is a Flop for Toyota,"My Toyota Sequoia was in the body shop for a minor accident and the rental car service provided me with a 2014 RAV 4 Base Model in black color. The Exterior design is flawless but when it came to the interior design, Toyota lost it big time. I drove this suv for a total of 200+ miles in a couple of days and here is my honest review on it. The front seats are very uncomfortable, hard and short and you want to get out of it after driving 30 minutes. Forget about taking the long interstate trips in this RAV 4. It is also very jumpy and I thought may be the tires are over inflated but I was wrong. The engine noise and road noise is loud and feels like you have a window open somewhere in the suv. Everything you touch inside the cabin feels hard plastic. The middle armrest between the front seats is a joke and Toyota should have done a better job in designing this armrest and more comfortable cushioned seats considering long trips that buyers might take in this suv. The standard rear view camera is a Big Plus. The Eco drive mode did save on the gas. The sports mode is fun to drive only if you do short driving. I was considering buying this 2014 RAV 4 but after my driving experience I say No Thank you ! So if you are interested in buying this 2014 RAV 4, my advice is to go and rent it and drive it around for a couple of days. If you think you still like it then its your choice but don't go to the dealership for a short test drive and then be stuck with it."
"09 22, 2013",Interesting new technology,I recently downgraded from a VW Routan minivan to RAV4. The car is very stylish and still roomy. The Pandora Box and Traffic apps are very interesting. The car is very comfortable and has good pickup. Very easy to park compared to a large minivan. I like the push start instead of a traditional key.
"09 19, 2013",jgolfski,"This vehicle is good looking, economical, and fuel efficient. the limited has the technology that vehicles costing $10,000 more have. One great car!!!"
"09 18, 2013",Rides too harsh!,"Toyota did a very good job on most of this vehicle. I leased a 13 xle and have had the it 6 months now. At first, the ride seemed firm but it starts to wear you out after a period of time. I do a lot of city driving and this vehicle lets you feel and hear everything on the road. It really takes away from an otherwise nice vehicle. The good side is city gas mileage...23-24 good...the exterior, everyone makes nice comments. I have had the vehicle in some nasty storms and it was a trooper. The engine is noisy but plenty of power. The transmission is top notch and the pseudo manual is really good and easy . No problems and that's what i expect from
Toyota, the harsh ride is just too much to take. Thank goodness, i found an excellent seat cushion for it. At the end of the lease, it's going back...too bad, it could have been great. Also, Toyota needs to fix the touch screen. It's easy to operate but in the sun, your on your own. You can't see a thing on it...."
"09 18, 2013",Better Size Engine/MPG than the other SUV's.,"I looked for over 6 months and primarily focused my interest on the Honda CRV because of it's size and style inside. Then when I came across the 2013 new RAV4, there were only two things that caught my eye: 2.5L engine and 30mpg gas. A bigger engine with better gas mileage? Cool! Took the test drive - there are 3 models and two wheelbase sizes 17 inch in the Base and XL model and 18 inch tires for the Limited. I test drove both - the 18 inch drove much smoother (the new car is stocked with Bridgestone tires). I like the drive, the features and room (especially the backseat) of the Limited. However, the engine is an electronic 6 speed that does make a ""wining"" noise when accelerating. The radio drowns it out. The car is fast, good acceleration, good gas mileage and nice interior (it's not real leather - it's a imitation leather, according to the dealership, because it is lighter and more humane than using real leather. Everything about the car is focused on ""lightness."" of all aspects - body, engine, transmission, etc., which all leads to better gas mileage for the bigger engine. Works for me!"
"09 16, 2013",Poor interior design,"Top glove box no door?
front console area only has one side, things fall onto floor,
no auto headlights, can't see display in sunlight,
we purchased an XLE, it came with a sun roof, but you can't get a power seat or leather or interior hatch release.
Mechanically it is Toyota, but the interior design and options are from another world. We tried a limited but that Softex is a poor substitute for leather."
"09 12, 2013",Bigger engine - better gas mileage than other SUVs,"I looked for 6 months for my first SUV; looked at Honda CRV....wanted style, gas mileage, bigger engine and a reasonable price for the model. I test drove the CRV but didn't like the handling or road noise. I had a Toyota Solara for over ten years so I knew about the Toyota quality. I looked at the New RAV 4 and what caught my eye was 1) size of interior ; 2) bigger engine than the CRV (2.5L vs 2.4) but it got better gas mileage! Rides like a car. With the Limited model you get 18-inch, vs 17 -inch tires on the base or XLE model. The engine is a 6 speed electronic that whines a bit. Eco option is a gas saver. Gets approx 24 mpg city. No road noise with the 18 inch tires. A little more with 17 inch. Great back seat space and good storage space in the back...LOVE IT!!"
"09 12, 2013",Short Life!!!!,"We have a 2006 RAV 4 and yes, we have 170,000 miles on it. But it should last for a lot longer. It uses a quart of oil every 600 miles and the transmission has just gone out. We have all the maintenance records with the dealership and drive very, very mildly. We have found blogs on other web sites having the same issues we have so if you want to get a vehicle to last 200,000+ miles, it's not the RAV 4!!!!"
"09  8, 2013",Beautiful SUV,Excellent value for the money. I love the 3 different driving modes and the gas mileage.and the roomy interior. I have the CR-v no comparison .
"09  8, 2013",Crashed,"Just got the RAV4 and had a horrific crash into a semi , whole front , and rt. door torn off . Most people would be dead in this type of crash . All 8 airbags saved them from injury. The RAV 4 saved my family , they walked away from a certain death ."
"09  4, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited,"Toyota hit a homerun with the 2013 RAV4. From the minute I test drove mine I was hooked. I love the comfort of the seats and having ""all"" the controls on the steering wheel cuts down on distractions. It's just a well thought out SUV. I love the NAV system it is very easy to use even for a fifty something guy like me. I bought it and the same day I drove it 300 miles across Texas."
"08 19, 2013",happy with purchase,I'm pleasantly surprised with the mpg I'm getting. I average 32.5 mpg (75% highway). I use the ECO mode only. No problems so far and I currently have 4000 miles. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable awd that drives like a car and gets really impressive gas milage.
"08 15, 2013",Poor Gas Mileage,"We purchased the 2013 two wheel drive Rav4 in July and have put about 2500 miles on it so far. We always drive it in Eco mode and have yet to get anywhere close to the stated mileage for the vehicle. Consistently it is getting 26 mpg (not 31 mpg as stated on the sticker) on the highway (driving 75mph with a/c on). We are careful to accelerate slowly in order to get the best gas mileage we can, but to no avail. In the city, we are getting 22 mpg. There again, we are not making rapid accelerations nor quick stops. My Toyota dealer just says, ""hu"" and has no answers. The only reason we sold our 4Runner, was to get a more efficient car and by going to the Rav4, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped."
"08 11, 2013",excellent fuel economy,"GREAT M.P.G ,after topping off the tank ,took a 105 mile road trip & got a whopping 42 miles per gallon with the eco switch on ......... yes 42 mpg ,with 4 people in the vehicle ...... 105 miles used 2.5 gallons of regular fuel . after topping it off again we used it around town somewhat city driving and retopped to find that we got 34 mpg city . so I did some investgating and found that Toyota wasn't able to check the fuel economy with the eco button on and hadn't any idea what difference it would make . lol THANKS TOYOTA !!"
"08  9, 2013",Best car I've owned yet!,"This car has the best safety ratings and feul economy for small SUVs. It also has great suspension, the car will glide over train tracks. It has comfortable seats and an awesome back up camera.

I received wonderful customer service from Toyota of Murfreesboro, especially Gus who sold me the car. All of the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car. I would refer anyone there.

Toyota offers a lifetime warrenty on 2013 vehicles, with 2 yr/2400mile maintenace package for free."
"07 27, 2013",Great Car!,"Traded in my Lexus ES for the Rav Limited. Wanted better mileage and more cargo room. Have had car for about 5 months. In ECO get 30 mpg in town, 29 this summer with AC. Have not tried the Sport mode yet.

I like the interior, think the seats are easier to maintain than leather. Interior design works just fine for me, easy controls, apps are great. The Blind Side Monitoring is fantastic, especially when backing out of a parking space. The back up camera screen is great. But I will say, I like the one in my husband's Toyota truck better as the camera screen is on the mirror.

The 2 year free maintenance is a plus as is Toyota reliability. Keyless door locks are so convienient .

One thing I would have liked is an adjustable passenger seat. Small thing I guess but Toyota should have added that, especially on the Limited.

I did test drive a KIA sedan and found it noisy, and cheap feeling. Have had the Lexus RX, IS, ES so that is all I really have to compare the Rav to and I find this car just fine. I like the road feel, being able to see better on all sides, mileage, interior, nice exterior style. Apps work great too, Bluetooth wonderful."
"07 22, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited AWD is OK with some issues,"We've driven nothing but Toyotas since 1968 (a Corona). For my needs, the ""Limited"" trim package was a good value and worth the cost. The RAV4 replaced a Camry XLE V6. The styling is fine (especially the power rear hatch) and interior room is good. The solid black interior is much nicer than the odd two-tone alernatives. Seat comfort in the driver's seat with the faux-leather is OK thanks to the lumbar support, but the lack of a power passenger seat seems cheap. The NAV system is easy to operate. Overall gas mileage has been better than the EPA estimate. The interior trim (mainly the center console) has too much hard/flimsy cheap-feeling pastic. The 2.5 engine performs well whether in eco or sport mode - I keep the vehicle in eco mode all the time. Overall, I view my new RAV4 as one of the better Toyotas I've owned."
"07  1, 2013",Rav 2013 review,"Just picked up our 2013 Rav Limited last week.
In our 2011 Rav there was a space to the right of the steering wheel where I could keep change.

No outlet in back seat for kids hand held games.

Nav screen to flat should pitch to drivers side.

No power seat on passenger seat.

No real spare tire."
"06 30, 2013",good small SUV,"Good design, good mileage, good price and fun to drive. I got a very good deal from Matia Toyota dealer in Sacramento, CA.
I have been shopping for some many Toyota dealer throughout Ca."
"06 26, 2013",Great Improvement,"Was considering an SUV but never paid much attention to the RAV4. When I saw the 2013 I loved the style and especially the new rear hatch. Some reviewers were concerned about performance, I can tell you there is a distinct difference driving in Sport Mode VS ECO Mode. This one is a true winner, Great Value. The XLE upgrade over the base model is well worth the small cost increase."
"06 15, 2013",New Rav4,"I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage with a 2013 year, I had a 2003 Nissan Altima and could expect at least 30 mpg on the highway. I'm 2 or 3 miles lower with a newer car, maybe it will get better, I hope"
"06  7, 2013",good car,"Great resale value, comfortable, easy to use, good fuel economy, and great sales person (kyle). I recommend this car highly!"
"06  6, 2013",Wonderful Experience at Toyota of Greensburg,"Bought a Rav 4 at Toyota of Greensburg and was treated wonderfully. Zach Guy my sales person and Brian the sales manager gave me a great deal on my trade and a great discount on the new vehicle. If you're thinking of buying a new Toyota stop in at Toyota of Greensburg, you won't be disappointed."
"06  1, 2013",RAV4,Gas milage seems to be very good. The standart back-up camera is extremely helpful when paralel parking. Seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room in the back seats. Ample cargo area. Surprisingly good pick-up when merging onto a highway. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
"05 26, 2013",lack of highway power,"took for a long test drive. city driving was ok, had enough power but when i took it on the highway and put it to the floor it was powerless. didnt have the power to jump over in the passing lane without getting run over. i was very dissapointed since i was ready to purchase. oh well, ill keep looking"
"05  6, 2013",Nice Ride,"Bought a 2013 RAV4 XLE. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip and averaged over 35 MPG traveling 65-70 MPH. It was a quiet, smooth ride. Very Happy with it. The only thing I would like is a more versatile center console that fits a cup with a handle, and maybe a more solid hood. Over rough roads the hood flexes some. It is a minor issue, just an aesthetics type thing. No regrets buying it so far."
"05  6, 2013",First new car for me,"I was looking to replace a 13 year old Toyota Camry. I originally looked at the prius, camry, honda civic, honda insight. I saw the new Rav4 and took it for a drive.

It was comfortable and loved the XLE trim upgrade for only $700. Well worth it.

The Econ mode lets me ge 38 MPG on the highway driving 55MPH on flat roads.

The SUV is extremely comfortable and hold all my gear and can carry my two kayaks on the roof racks.

I love the electronics. Ipod connects both bluetooth and through usb cable.

I love this car. Thinking about buying another one to replace my wifes Honda element."
"05  5, 2013",Best small suv,"The changes made to the 2013 are excellent. I would have bought a Honda CRV if Toyota had not changed the lift gate and spare tire. I waited four months for the RAV4 to get manufactured and delivered to local dealerships. It was worth the wait! I bought the Limited model and love the options that come on that model. I have had the vehicle three weeks and have been getting excellent gas milage. There is nothing that I don't like about the vehicle.
Bob S"
"05  2, 2013",Best Small SUV,"Traded a 2012 GMC Terrain for the 2013 Rav 4 XLE. Love everything about this vehicle. The mpg is excellent, fun to drive, very comfortable and amble cargo area. This is a great value ... you will not be disappointed."
"04 22, 2013",So far execellent,"Confusing instruments= seems to cover all I need to know,
Not used to the system !! Used to larger autos but seems to do all that I require and fun to drive. I'm happy with the TOY!!"
"04 11, 2013",Love this car,I had a ford escape before and decided to try Toyota. This Toyota Rav4 is Great. I could not ask for a better car. I heard that Toyota was a great company but Wow am I impressed. I love everything about it
"04 11, 2013",Top Notch Small SUV,"I'm one of those people that need to research everything to the nth degree before I purchase.
I researched and test drove many small SUV's.......

For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4.

I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle.
The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's.

Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"
"04  3, 2013",the best car I ever had,"We bought our first Toyota RAV 4in 2007.....For 5 years we had no problem at all..but we lost IT.in SANDY...and we had no doubts that we should buy again RAV 4,,model of 2013....The car that we had before our first RAV 4_ was Land Rover...and it was not that reliable like TOYOTA .RAV 4...."
"03 20, 2013",First SUV,"I started my purchasing process setting up with a buying service and using an insurance company's recommendations. I had no intention of purchasing a Toyota, in fact I was opposed to the idea. I'm still surprised I purchased one.

I had test driven the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-5, Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox, Lincoln MKX, Subaru Outback, and Forester.

I needed a car like ride, and room for several suitcases or crates in the back, I wanted AWD, leather heated seats and good MPG. Didn't think I'd get all that.

There are a lot of good choices, I do believe I could have been happy with several of these.
I bought an AWD Limited with no additional options.

the pluses of the RAV4:
* bluetooth, it works flawlessly. Didn't expect to have that standard
*Nice ride, quiet cabin.
* I'm averaging 27 mpg (1500 miles) though I drive aggressively. When driving in eco mode and being mindful of mpg, I can get 31 mpg.
*AWD was perfect for our recent snows. I drove it in 6"" of fresh unplowed snow. It's surefooted.
*keyless entry. . With gloves on in winter it's just so much easier.
*the 2 tone interior looks great.
*great ride, even in the back seats.
*Plenty of leg room for my tall family.

Negs:
*so so stereo. (3 others were far better) I did not get Nav. or the stereo upgrade My previous car had a better stereo. It's 8 yrs old too. A new stereo on their top tier style should sound better.

* The dealers all advertise the seats in the Rav4 Limited as leather. They are NOT. I'd decided on the Rav4 after driving the Honda. That dealer told me the Rav4 seating was a synthetic/leather blend. After researching the Softex I called the salesman on it, he then checked on it and it's synthetic. I felt deceived. I can't believe they don't know it's not leather. I went to 3 dealers and heard the same thing.
(I asked for and received an additional price cut by the dealer, for their mistake.) . I do like the feel of the Softex, and hope it lasts like leather."
"03 18, 2013",Great Car,Keep making Great cars and trucks for generations to come!!! Will have 3 kids needing cars in the next few years
"03  8, 2013",Third Rav4,"We leased a 2006, purchased a 2010 and just got the 2013. The 2006 had a 6 which could make your nose bleed when punching it at a light...whee. All were reliable with no issues. The only complaint(s) are we miss the dual lid on the console storage box, the sliding cover on the upper dash storage shelf and the sunglasses storage in the roof. The backup camera is awesome as is the Bluetooth sync for your phone. We got a little organizer for the console storage and are looking for some kind of box for the open dash shelf. With only 500 miles we are getting better mileage than the 2010."
"03  7, 2013",Happy so far,"Have owned only 3 weeks but am happy with my choice. Was also seriously considering a Honda CRV and looked at several other crossovers (every make has one and they all look about the same). Preferred the RAV4 XLE (FWD, cloth seats) exterior and interior design and the timing chain (vs. CRV's belt which requires major $ to replace at 80,000 miles). Also dealer provided lifetime powertrain warranty at no additional cost. Toyota made some nice improvements on the 2013 model vs. prior ones. Hopefull still one of the most reliable cars made."
"03  5, 2013",First New Vehicle Purchased,"My husband and I took the plunge and bought our first New Vehicle EVER after our beloved Jeep rolled over 200k miles and ceased to be as reliable as we wished. We did a ton of lot shopping and test driving before finally making a deal with the very professional staff at Rouen Toyota in Maumee, OH. Our salesman Byron was top notch and spent a lot of time showing me all of the features of my new Rav4. He was knowledgable, patient, and kind toward our children. I would recommend this dealership, Byron, and our new SUV to everyone. The Rav4 has the fuel economy we'd been lacking and the space we've grown accustomed to with our Jeep and Tundra Pickup. A good price and a zippy vehicle for my everyday commute."
"03  4, 2013",RAV 4 Limited,This car drives and handles much better then Honda CR-V EX-L. Can't go wrong for the price and reliability rating. if your are in compact SUV market consider this car.
"02 28, 2013",Looks like the rest performs like a dog,"A long time Toyota RAV owner and fan, this car was a huge disappointment. All the hype AROUND THE LATE REVEAL...LOOKS LIKE ALL THE REST IN ITS CLASS! Performance....felt like I could run faster and the ""engine sounds and performance says cheap""...not the sticker...very disappointed...will take a look at some others..suggest you do the same and compare before you buy!"
"02 27, 2013",lovin' my new car,"When looking for a new car I knew I wanted a small SUV. I looked at a few different makes and models from other dealerships. I absolutely fell in love with the 2013 Rav4. Just this year they came out with the new Rav4 without the tire on the back of it. It is just a beautiful car inside and out. It might be a small SUV but has a ton of room inside and the back seats even recline! The only thing that they could improve on is the back speakers. They are in the door and its hard to hear anything in the back, other than that, I love everything about it."
"02  9, 2013",Best Looking little SUV.,Reliable SUV. Just right. Smooth ride. Love the new hatch back door. Blessed to own one. Was waiting for Toyota to make pop up back door without the tire on the door. Got one right away.
"01 19, 2013",RAV4 - Much improvement!,"I disagree with the reviewer that removing the 3rd Row option from the RAV4 was a mistake. It was silly to offer such an option in a small SUV - not even a child could fit. I'm sure demand was very low so Toyota made a wise business decission.

I just purchased a 2013 yesterday and I love the new design. I had a 2010 4 Cylinder RAV4 before and have always been happy with the 4 Cylinder. I have driven a V6 in the past and did not see the need for a V6 in this car. I have plenty of power and in the new RAV4, I have Eco and Sport mode.

Hurry out and test drive one. I love my Display Audio and the Bluetooth setup in about 60 seconds."
"11  4, 2023",The RAV4 is the best running car I’ve ever had.,I love my 2013 RAV4. It runs great. I haven’t had any problems with it. The key is to always keep up the maintenance  Toyota makes the best cars.
"03  5, 2023",2013 Rav4,"Car is very reliable, i have had it almost 10 years. It has 155,000 mi
Have replaced the normal things like brakes and tires. It has a stiff ride, changed shocks and struts and still stiff. which is the #1 disappointment. Between 45 and 55 it has a bad vibration.."
"11 25, 2022",Terrible handling/ride,Worst ride ever. CD player had to be repaired. Battery needed to be installed. Dealership held back on providing problems. Probably my fault for not asking. Just relied on the  Toyota name. Headlights  were foggy and should have been improved .Defect in left front fender. Needed a wheel alignment. I could go on. I was the fool.
"09  9, 2022",I had to replace bulbs several times.,"2013 RAV4 I bought this small SUV with 25,000 miles. This car is Mexico/Canada build. I am gonna keep it short when this car passed the 105,000 miles started to fall apart( literally). The car is “affordable “ because it is built with cheap parts, and replacement are very expensive. I had to replace shock absorbers, many lights, and TRANSMISSION."
"04  5, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable,"Interior and exterior appearance are just perfect. It has plenty of power and provides a smooth ride in any weather condition.
We have owned this car for 4 years and will keep it for another 4 years at least."
"12 14, 2020",Glad to be back in a Toyota.,We had an older RAV4 and when looking for another vehicle knew we wanted to check out something newer.   Toyota has door a good job in updating the look and comfort without compromising the performance.   Happy to have given another RAV4 a home.
"09  4, 2020",The nicest comfortable vehicle so far,"this car meets all I  need in a vehicle, roomy, comfortable , allot of power, and not to complicated. great handling car , smooth ride. I would buy another."
"08 16, 2020",Reliable Small SUV,"We have 50,000 miles on this car.    So far no defects.    Fabric seats hard to clean.  We get 24 city and 28 highway mpg from the base 4 cylinder engine.   A bit noisy on long trips."
"05 30, 2020",Not a car for comfort or room,"This car is extremely uncomfortable, very stiff over bumps. It doesn't have a lot of room inside and nothing makes sense to me. It's just too bad because Toyota has always been one of my favorite vehicles. But they really did a horrible job on this one. I would never get a rav 4 again after that."
"05 24, 2020","Safe, durable reliable.","The Rav-4 is a great SUV for folks who have long winter commutes. The safety features just keep getting better and that truly matters. You can expect to put 300,00 miles on the speedometer with very few repairs."
"05 19, 2020",Beautiful car,"This car exceeds my expectations so far.  Rides beautifully, quiet, and smooth.  Definitely enjoy driving this vehicle.  Good gas mileage and a good solid, reliable car that comes highly recommended by my mechanic."
"05 18, 2020",Love the car,Haven't driven it long but so far I love it. It's comfortable and drives great. I like the compact look but still is roomy inside.
"04 22, 2020",Overall Great Car,"This was the first car I have purchased. A limited edition Toyota RAV4. It has leather seats, sunroof, and is a beautiful cherry red color. I love everything about this car but I wish the screen inside the car looked a little more updated. But can't be too picky considering it is a 2013. I am love with this car. Also drives very smoothly and has good pick me up. Would recommend this car to anyone."
"03 30, 2020",It is exactly the right car for me.,"This car is easy for me to get in and out of.  It suits my needs, is easy to park, and has been so reliable.  I've received many compliments on it since it was new, even from strangers in the grocery store parking lot."
"03 23, 2020",reliable and dependable car,"the suv meet the need of my daughter day to day commute from home to work and to do some run around.i will highly recommed this suv to any one that need a reliable car, economy and fuel efficient."
"03 22, 2020",Gray Phantom,"I thoroughly enjoy this car. It's comfortable, easy to drive, dependable, sporty, carries everything I need or want, and also carries the Thule cargo carrier on top fully loaded."
"01  9, 2020",Transmission issues,"Transmission failed after 96,000 miles. New transmission installed and slipping after 16,000 miles with torque converter shuddering. Every mechanic i knew said get a Toyota, they're soooo reliable. Now idk what to get. This makes me so suspicious of every car I look at."
"11 19, 2019",More then I hoped for!,"Was looking for SUV/AWD/Navigation.  Got more then that!!!  Limited and Loaded 
Feels so awesome driving my new Toyota RAV4
Thank you Blaise Alexander Subaru of Williamsport"
"11  2, 2019",Good city car,City car for convenience. Reliable transportation. Not a highway car. Lacking the smooth ride due to light weight and under power. I should have bought the Highlander. The wife loves the ease of parking.
"10 21, 2019",I’m not sure,My car kinda shift gears or jerk can’t really explain it but it does that if I’m driving under 40mph. Not sure what’s wrong with it hope my transmission isn’t slipping. I have a friend who has the same exact one but hers 2 years newer mines a 2013 and hers does the same thing.
"09 14, 2019",First time I have ever Owned a Toyota,First time ever owning a Toyota SUV I really like the vehicle if you’re looking for an SUV Toyota RAV4 is really a nice ride
"08 19, 2019",Fun to drive!,"I wasn’t sold on this vehicle at first but after a few days I grew to love it! It’s super fun to drive & has most of the features I want in a vehicle. The front and back are super roomy...my bf who’s 6’ tall fits extremely well & comfortably in both the front & back of the vehicle. It has a great ride & gets good mpg. I would have given it 5 stars BUT this vehicle lacks a few very important features...ones I didn’t think to ask about because quite frankly I just assumed every vehicle had it these days. My bad! What it doesn’t have is air conditioning vents in the back of the suv! Say what!? I know...I was quite shocked to discover this as I was driving my kids around on a hot day...the vent in the dash...which the right half of is fake and doesn’t work...is supposed to cool off the back of the vehicle. Why oh why would anyone ever design a vehicle to not have a/c vents for the backseat passengers??? Another key feature it doesn’t have is remote start, however, some will have that...but don’t be like me & think it’s standard because it’s not & now I have to pay to have an after market remote start installed. Ugh. One last thing I don’t like & honestly thought no vehicle had anymore is a lever inside the vehicle on the floor alongside the drivers seat that you have to press to open the gas tank. Let’s just say the first time I stopped for gas was quite the experience. It took me a few to figure out how to open the door...sigh. But overall it’s a good vehicle."
"08 11, 2019",Boring but reliable,"Very very reliable, no issues at all. Engine is underpowered, but good all wheel drive system and roomy interior. Good value for the money if you don’t care about engine performance"
"07 23, 2019",Great Value RAV4,"This car was a good in all weather, reliable, and well put together.  It performed new as it did 7 years later.  Toyota quality is apparent."
"07 16, 2019",good family suv,"rides good, looks good, goes great in the snow.  small suv small but big with lots of room.   the dealship wait area is clean with lots of chairs, popcorn and ice cold bottle water.  a play area for the little ones.  all family members are welcome."
"05 20, 2019",Most reliable car I've ever owned.,Great all around vehicle. Very roomy and great gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4. They're just really well built and reliable. I love Rav 4's.
"05 13, 2019",WIFE'S NEW CAR,"WIFE LOVES THIS CAR! SHE REPLACED HER LEXUS IS250 WHICH WAS A GREAT CAR. I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD MISS HER LEXUS, BUT LIKES THIS CAR BETTER - MORE VISIBILITY, SIMILAR POWER, MORE REAR SEAT LEGROOM."
"04 29, 2019","Reliable, Economical",Good visibility for the driver.  A little noisy.   Zero problems.   I have 45000 miles on it.  It would be better with fabrics that would be easier to clean.
"04 21, 2019",I had a 2008 rav4 bought it used,"Bought a used 2008 Toyota RAV4 in 2010 with 50000 miles on it drove to 160000 miles on it. It is by far the best and trouble free suv I have ever owned. Never did It leave me stranded on the road although I got stuck in a storm in buffalo and couldn’t see a thing , this suv drove me to the hotel with inches of snow. If it was any other suv I would have probably been stranded on the highway. Overall all the years of owning just did oil changes and routine Maintainance. Sometimes did oil changes after 7000 miles and car just ran forever. In deep snow the all wheel drive system is not the best but I used snow tires and never really had a problem. Way to go rav4 it’s the best car."
"04  9, 2019",The most reliable vehicle I've ever owned! LOVE!!,"Friends & family love this car! Drives like  8 cylinder, luxurious ride,  and plenty of room for passengers, luggage, etc.  I love driving this gem!"
"03 29, 2019",Recommend or Not Recommend,"So far so Good. This car has room for my legs and plenty of power for a 4 cyl.
It drives nice and has a smooth comfort ride to it."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota Dependability 5 stars,"Purchased a used 2013 awd Rv4 limited with 43K,now has 55K,not 1 issue,AWD great for our winters in Buffalo,peppy enuf,decent gas mileage,handles well,comfortable ride for a small suv,has all the amenities,2 minor Quips,the info screen is useless in sunlight,cant see the info at all,and,for a top of the line limited the door lock switches,window switches etc are not lit at night,come on toyota talk about cheaping out,all in all a great vehicle."
"02 17, 2019",Another great example of a high quality Toyota,"Excellent value and utility in a variety of uses

Very reliable  and stable on the road

Huge amount of flexible space 

My second RAV- drove the prior one for 9 years and over 90000 miles"
"02 16, 2019",Toyota Blizxard Pearl paint chips!  Buyer BEWARE,"I love my car.  However the paint is peeling like crazy. Toyota knows of the issue and refuses to do anything about it. Research the paint before you buy. I cannot even have my car detailed without losing huge chunks of paint! Blizzard Pearl Paint cannot even stick to the primer, the entire car has to be stripped, sanded, and painted with different everything.  #Toyotapaintpeels"
"01 31, 2019",Nice car,Very nice car.  It is very comfortable.  I am impressed with the ride quality.  The heater worked wonderfully.  Visibility is fantastic.  I am happy with the safety rating of the car as well.
"01 24, 2019",Good car for the money,My only complaint is too much road noise.  Good mileage. Great handling in any weather conditions.  Wonderful dealership.  Have had no problems other than  only needed a new battery after 5 years
"12  1, 2018","I liked the RAV4 so much, I bought it.","I drove a hr to test drive a Toyota RAV4. I liked it so much, I ended up buying it. It was definitely worth it."
"11 22, 2018",very reliable,"My second Rav4. Very reliable, economical, tons of room in the back. Peppy, reasonably quiet, shifts like a dream and will tow my 15' A-liner trailer!"
"11 20, 2018",Most reliable car ever .,"This car is comfortable and friendly for owner.Is very fast , light and nice .to driver.I can recommend these car for all futures  buyers.
I love him."
"11 17, 2018",Great all around car!,"This car is great for so many different situations that you need it for. It holds 5 people, cabin is very roomy(more than my old midsize suv), gets good fuel economy, and is reliable. The base sound system is amazing considering it isn?t upgraded or anything. It could have a little more power on the highway but otherwise performance is good and ride comfort is fine. It?s just a good average all around suv."
"11 13, 2018",Finally a Toyota Owner and I could not be happier!,"I had a small SUV for a few years that turned out to be a lemon and was on the hunt for a new or used small SUV. My family has long been a fan of Toyotas but I've never owned one. After lengthy research by myself and my husband we found a great price on a used RAV4 and went for a test drive. I was skeptical about having a 4 cylinder vehicle again after years of driving an Accord but I was super impressed with the way the RAV4 drove. I love the safety features (blind spot monitor, back up camera and side curtain airbags) and since I have the Limited package the leather and upgraded stereo made the car even more appealing. I've been averaging around 27mpg which is 6 better than my old car and really enjoy driving again. I have a 35 minute commute to work one way and this small SUV has been great. I'm anxious to see how it fares with an Ohio winter. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone looking to purchase a small SUV. It has a real transmission (unlike many other in its class) and the safety features are top notch."
"11  7, 2018",Good car,Nice vehicle. 4 cyl is surprisingly sprightly for a naturally aspirated engine. AWD in a small SUV was just what I needed. Should be reliable.
"10 28, 2018",Awesome Car,"Great vehicle, service records were available. Salesman Steve Groves was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. Great sales team & showroom. Service folks were nice as well."
"10 10, 2018",Very happy with the Toyota Rav4.,"Excellant warranty.   Covered tourque converter even though the veh.
was several months past the 5 yr warranty.   That was the only problem that I ever had with the veh.  Very dependable;  comfortable, and great gas milage.   Just bought a new 2018 Toyota Rav5 to replace this one."
"10  5, 2018",Reliable & versatile,"We have owned all Toyota models (except carolla).
They, over the years have proven to be extremely reliable, long lasting & have great resale value. 
After owning a 1995 RAV, 2013 Redesign appears to be larger than older models. Ride & seats are very comfortable."
"07 25, 2018",Amazing Car for a Reasonable Price,Wanted a reliable car that was perfect for all the seasons that Colorado has to offer and my Rav4 is a perfect fit. A sleek interior and bluetooth radio lets your drive in style.
"07 10, 2018","Comfortable, Economical and Reliable!","Happy first time Toyota RAV4 owner. Reliable in any weather. Reasonably comfortable, economical on gas. Spacious, easy for passengers + cargo. Disappointed 2013 NO COMPASS!!!"

"05 11, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"We have always had great luck with Toyota vehicles: Camry and RAV 4.
Internet Auto Brokers wrote into the contract that we could have the car checked with our choice of mechanics and our trusted garage gave its blessing."
"05  3, 2018",Love my car,The car is amazing. I love how it drives . It?s comfortable and overall better on gas . I love how it feels like a car but is and suv
"04 28, 2018",My dream Car,"The Car is in excellent shape and no matter the rudeness of dealership, I'm  still in love the car. I am coming from driving a Honda CRV and wanted to try Toyota. Love the RAV4 better"
"03 30, 2018",Love it,"I've had it for almost 5 years now, and still really enjoy it. Over-all, most reliable car I've ever owned.  Other than a cracked front window from a stone chip, the only think I've done on this car is oil changes. Built so well!"
"03 23, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"This car is perfect for me.  I'm short and not all cars fit very well for short people.. But this rav4 is great.. Wonderful gas milage,  very comfortable,  and roomie my husband is tall and it works for him too..."
"03 16, 2018",Great affordable car i purchase,I fell inlove with this car. Its very comfortable and very economic. It drives so smooth and very spacious inside. It feels like brand new car.
"02 25, 2018",Mister,Sporty and roomy and has some spunk love the blue tooth feature. I like the backup camera and all the room in the back for storage.
"02 15, 2018",I love the reliabilty of toyota,"It's good looking and also excellent on gas. I love how it zipps around town, it's so easy to drive and park and I know it will last for years to come!"
"01 29, 2018",Like driving chocolate. Smooth and silky.,"I have been driving a Subaru for the last few years I loved it, but wanted a small SUV that sat a little higher and had less miles. I found my 2013 Toyota Rav4  on car gurus. I love it!. The exterior styling is sleek and inside, luxurious. The back up camera is so helpful, as is the Bluetooth. And who doesn't love a moon roof!!. I'm looking forward to many adventures in my new Toyota."
"01 13, 2018",Love my Rav!!,This SUV is great. I love the all wheel drive and my back seat bench seating. The back seat is adjustable for you to lay back which is awesome! Lots of trunk space. I've had my 2013 RAV4 limited for 5 years
"01  8, 2018","This is my 2nd RAV4, both bought new.",My title says it all... it's one of my best investment made. Best value for the money and reliability and quality.
"12 10, 2017",My favorite Car of ALL Time,"I love my Rav4. The car far exceeds my expectations and the mileage advertised by Toyota. On my recent trip to Atlantic City, I was able to get well over 35 mpg on straight highway driving. I have plenty of room in the trunk for my folding bike plus luggage. The seating is comfortable and the way they are designed, they hold you on sharp curves."
"12  1, 2017",Good car,"The car has met my needs, but I preferred my Mitsubishi Outlander for perks. It drives well, but I had to replace tires at under 30,000 miles and warranty had just expired because it was already over 3 years old."
"11 27, 2017",Love the exterior of our Rav 4,We love our Rav 4 lots of room like all the extras included in our purchase we have always owned a Toyota  along with our grown children who also own Toyotas.
"11 21, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"This is my second RAV4, you can't go wrong with them... Toyota makes a good product and although you're going to pay more upfront, in the long run you'll have saved as maintenance is minimal cause they're built to last. I spent next to nothing in my last one compared to some and I had it a little over 10 yrs. Great Mid size SUV, sporty and fun to drive, absolutely love mine."
"11 15, 2017",Crashed,"I was T boned directly into the drivers door/front tire from a CRV traveling over 55mph.  Every airbag deployed as I spun multiple times, ending up off the road down in a field.  I climbed out of the passengers side with only a limp.  I am thankful every safety feature of this Toyota protected me."
"11  4, 2017",$2 BILL,Fun driving spacious vehicle where I can carry bowling xxxxx and golf clubs without having to take one or the out of the car...
"10 22, 2017",The best car I have owned,"Toyota's are my favorite male of cars. My first was a Camry that went far beyond 200k miles. My favorite model years ago was my Avalon, again going over 200 k miles. My next car was Camry which at 200k mi was given to a young couple needing a car 2 years ago and it is still a smooth ride. I now own the BEST car I have ever owned, a Rav4. I bought a 2013 fully loaded car 1 1/2 yrs ago.  It is great on gas. It drives smoothly and the all wheel drive was exceptional last winter."
"10 22, 2017",Most comfortable and reliable car I've owned.,"This car makes hauling anything very easy. Very spacious, and comfortable to ride in. This car has been extremely reliable since the day I got it. I have a 45 minute commute to work every day and this car makes the time fly by with its AUX chord plug in option, and smooth riding experience."
"10 18, 2017",Most super performance car I owned,"This is my first car ever and never regretted my decision of buying it. Its very comfortable, good mileage, less maintenance issues and great for long drives. Never got a back pain even with ling drives and hill drives."
"09 26, 2017",RAV4 is an awesome ride!,All around great SUV. Superbly spacious & ride is smooth. Great on gas mileage as well. Love my RAV4.
"09 12, 2017",Best All Around Car!,"This vehicle is stylish, fun to drive, great gas mileage.  I've owned all kinds of cars, I never thought a Toyota would meet all my needs and then some.   I liked it so much I got one for our Daughter.  I absolutely love this car!"
"08 23, 2017",This is my first Toyota and I love it!!,I love the RAV4 and how it handles! There's nothing I don't like about it! I will always and forever buy Toyotas from now on!
"08 17, 2017",Is the best and most reliable vehicle ever,"These has met all my needs, its easy to transport my family,entertainment is enhanced,it is cormfotable in terms of seats,wheels are okay and more other features."
"08  7, 2017",Beautiful on the outside; could use more on the in,Looks great; drives well. Can't get past the fact the fact that this car does not have a bin for my sunglasses inside. Bought this after owning a 2006 Sienna XLE Limited and am disappointed that the 2013 RAV4 is not even half as luxurious as concerns inside storage space and smooth ride
"08  2, 2017","dependable, great for an SUV, just not what I want","I purchased this SUV w the thoughts of needing cargo space .... practicality, but my heart is in need of a convertible w some punch..... prev owned toyota convertible, the back up camera in my Rav & bluetooth are both great extras, sharp but seems this model is similar to several other SUVs produced @ this time, would like better if had unique look separating from others designs overall though drives well & is dependable.... Toyota does seem to offer more ""extras"" for the $ also"
"07 16, 2017",Extremely Reliable Care!,"The Toyota Rav4 is an exceptional car for my money. The 2.5L DOHC 4 Cyl Engine puts out a healthy 275hp and 172lb-ft of torque. Plenty of pep as well as great gas mileage. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! If you're looking a great crossover SUV, put this one on your list to test drive."
"07 10, 2017",Great Mid-Size Car,"Bought this car just before starting our family.  We really wanted something safe, reliable, and had a good amount of space without being too big.  This fit the bill, we love this Rav4!  It also does great in snow and off road which is a good plus for us."
"07  9, 2017",RAV4 super car,"WOW.... This is one gorgeous RAV.... Loaded with features and options, backed by Toyota, this is a must have. Not only is the color amazing, the ride is awesome, and the comfort is top notch"
"07  6, 2017",Reliable and Efficient Car,"I used to drive Sedan, and getting into SUV has given me a what I was looking for, specifically more space for my children which served as family car for short and long trips."
"06 29, 2017",Very good on gas and very comfortable.,Love the color of interior. Best comfort on our trips we have taken. 28-30 miles to gallon on trips. I would buy another one when needed.
"06 28, 2017",Great pickup for a 4 cylinder,"I bought this 2013 vehicle new, currently have 64k miles on it, and have enjoyed driving it. It has great pickup, which helps in quick passing in tight spots. It is comfy (of course I'm not a tall/big person). I've had to date no major service issues."
"06 11, 2017",Comfortable ride!,"I really liked my Toyota Rav4. It was a great size for someone who doesn't love large SUV's but wants some cargo space, or has a family. The car was very reliable, and drove awesome. I did feel like it had some slight issues in snow (after further research realized it was probably just my model) driving, and heavy rain. The weight distribution was slightly off, and the back end would slide slightly. Still loved the car, and would totally recommend!"
"06  5, 2017",Is my 2nd Toyota.  They do it right.,"When I test drove this previously owned SUV, I realized there have been many advances in features I have missed.  My Rav 4 is such a pleasure to drive."
"06  1, 2017",Cant recommend it,"I bought this RAV4 to replace my F150. I had F150s for over 20 yrs and they just got too big for my needs, enter the RAV. The car did everything I wanted except for the comfort of the seats, after 20 mins I would get pain in the back of my legs regardless of how I positioned the seat, I could vary it a bit but never eliminate the pain and discomfort. I put 25,000 miles a year on this car so I can speak with good authority on these below average seats. It doesn't present in the test drive but on longer drives its torture. The F-150s are all day long comfortable as is the Subaru Outback that replaced this RAV4. Toyota made a nice vehicle with the RAV that suits the needs of many consumers but failed in the driver/car interface in epic fashion. The Nissan Murano outclasses the RAV by light years in seat comfort.  BEWARE if you are shopping a RAV4 try a Nissan, Subaru... see how the seat feels and think long and hard before getting that RAV. Other than that it was very good in all other areas but lets face it, if you dread even short trips in your car it doesn't matter what else it does, it has to meet a minimum comfort level and the RAV 4 does not, not even close."
"05 16, 2017",Best vehicle purchase ever!,"I only wished I'd gotten remote open/close on the door of the storage area. Seats let down for more storage space and when I open my sunroof, I'm in a sports vehicle. The sound system is awesome. I'm not a soccer mom, just like the room and the idea of having space for everything when needed. This is such a cool vehicle to drive, some knee discomfort; and as we all know, Toyota is a mainstay of reliability! One thing, the driver's seat leg room, distance between the seat and the accelerator/brake is a little uncomfortable for me, I try adjusting the seat to different positions but to no avail, smh.  This is causing my right knee to ache, be uncomfortable."
"05  5, 2017",Just what I needed!,"The model I got is not as ""glitzy"" as some SUVs, however, that's really not what I was looking for in a vehicle. I need decent leg room for a tall husband, and the RAV4 provides plenty. Gas mileage is definitely a selling point, as is the reliability typically associated with Toyota. The outside looks impressive and sleek, but I do think that the inside could use a bit more refinement. Turning and overall ride were tight and smooth. It's perfect for carting the family!"
"03 30, 2017",You want one,"The newer rav4 is a great small SUV for everyday use with lots of space for the random times you need it. I love the laws.  I say best small suv, out there and plus it doesn't look like a bubble!"
"03 28, 2017",Toyota Rav 4,"I really really love this vehicle. I went from driving a Nissan Sentra 2003 to a 2013 Rav 4  so this is quite  the upgrade. So far I have no complaints with the car besides a leaking sunroof. I'm not really sure why that is (I haven't looked into yet) but I went for a touchless car wash and the entire front interior of my car got wet. In terms of driving performance, it's a very smooth and comfortable ride. You won't even know when you hit 120 km/h but it does get slightly noisy when you do. In terms of gas, it's not as great as I thought it would be even on eco mode, but it's still quite good. For an SUV it definitely drives like a regular Sports car and doesn't take up space when parking. Overall, I'd say it's one of those vehicles that make you find reasons to drive. :)"
"03 27, 2017",Bought a Rav4,"Great deal, good service from BigM Chevrolet in Radcliff, Ky. 
 Ask for sales rep Tiffany Frizzell."
"03 25, 2017",Great SUV!,"I just bought a 2013 Rav4 Limited a week ago, and I am LOVING it! It is so comfortable and surprisingly roomy. All the safety features are fantastic, I feel like my family is much more protected. It has so many options that make it fun to drive."
"03 22, 2017",I just bought it,"I just bought the car about a week ago. The rear window wiper needed to be replaced (20k miles). Other than that...everything great so far. Very good gas mileage, comfortable ride, lots of space, and drives well in snow"
"03 22, 2017",The newest car i ever owned,i LUV THIS CAR IT DRIVES SO NICE AND IS COMFY. Has alot of gadgets i never knew came on a car. It quite and drives like a dream
"03 21, 2017",Overall very reliable car,Great vehicle Great gas mileage and comfortable interior. It is very good in the winter weather. Dealership always excellent with service.
"03 17, 2017",The car I needed most,I never expect that this car is so big inside. Its a suv that i never expect im gonna get but its good on gas
"03 16, 2017",Dima was Amazing,"I had an amazing experience with Dima. He provided amazing customer service, i loved the service he provided !"
"03 11, 2017",best car ever!,"I love my Rav4, second one I have purchased! Always reliable, they are comfortable, economical and you can use it for almost anything! They are the best!"
"02 18, 2017",Rav Too...,Purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Rav4 Limited and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love this vehicle. Truth be told I sure see a huge difference between this and the 2003 Rav4 L that I previously had. Way bigger way more powerful way more room and tons quieter. Not sure why people complain about noise because mine is ultra quiet. For starters tires are very important. Mine came with noncheap Cooper CS3  all Season Touring tires that are so smooth and quiet and handle great. The design is sexy and upscale. I do agree with those that mention the door extensions and yes they do tend to collect dirt and snow. I really don't let that dampen my spirits. Overall I Really Love my Rav4 Limited. In Silver metallic it's really HOT....
"01 27, 2017",Not what I expected from Toyota,"2013 rav 4 Limited needed a tourque converter with 40,000 miles then a new transmission at 49,000 and still has no pick up. Overall worse purchase of my life! So disappointed and will no longer purchase any type of a Toyota"
"03 26, 2016",Great Reliable Car for the Money!,"We purchased a used 2013 Toyota Rav4 XLE roughly a month ago with about 40,000 miles, and while this vehicle has it's drawbacks in areas, most of them I can live with. My previous vehicle was a 99 Toyota Tacoma with manual transmission. In comparison the Rav4 drives and rides like a dream. I will say that it does have a stiff ride to it, which seems to be a common complaint, but I still find it to be a fairly comfortable overall. I'm mostly a city driver and don't think I would be doing much off-roading with this vehicle. Mostly just wanted something that would handle well in the winter. I love that the rear seats recline, which is a nice feature for passengers in the vehicle. The cars computer system is a little clunky, and the interface could be a little more user friendly. I had a few issues with keeping my phone connected via bluetooth, but a quick internet search and updating the cars firmware quickly resolved those issues. The usb plug and play feature for music is nice. Put your music on a jump drive and play it directly through the audio system. We actually put all our music on an old hard drive we had laying around and plugged it in through a usb cable, so I have my whole library in the car wherever we go. The voice command does not work terribly well and often misinterprets or cannot understand what you are saying to it. Not a huge deal as I find this to be a useless feature on most devices, such as my cell phone. It works well for dialing numbers and answering phone calls, which is all I really need it to do anyway. Navigation voice command is touch and go. Beware that this vehicle takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.The trade off is you only have to change it every 10,000 miles, so that will likely save you money overall as it's basically three oil changes in one. There is a noticeable difference between the Eco, Standard, and Sport mode (although very slight). I found that I actually get the same mileage in Standard mode that I do in Eco mode, but Eco has less power when you're driving and accelerating. I'm not terribly aggressive on the peddle though. Sport mode does eat up a little bit of the MPG, but the vehicle seems to be more responsive. 95% of the time I just leave it in standard mode. Gets about 29 MPG with mixed highway and city driving, which is the sticker MPG. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but I'm fairly certain I could get between 30-32 MPG. The gas tank is listed at almost 16 gal, but I've yet to get more than 13 into the tank when the vehicle gas warning light first comes on. It's possible that there are another 3 gallons of fuel in there, I guess you wouldn't know until you actually ran the vehicle out of fuel. I love the back up cam, which is a nice standard feature to have for those city parking situations. Overall I'm am happy with the Rav4 thus far. We bought it for more passenger room and Toyota's reliability. Time will tell. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy one."
"03 23, 2016",Great Compact Crossver,"We have owned four Jeeps and got tired of the high cost of maintenance. We bought it as a Toyota Certified vehicle, it is extraordinarily good. We've owned it for three months and taken it into the mountains in snow, across the desert, and on 2-4 day cross country interstate trips from the Mojave to the Rockies and back. It's a keeper. It has three modes eco, regular and sport, and a very intelligent AWD system. Handles well, very comfortable, and while it does not have the ground clearance of a Jeep, we are extremely pleased with our purchase."
"03 22, 2016",Not at all impressed,"We bought our 2013 Rav4 new 3 years ago. We currently have 58,000 miles on it. There are 5 parking lot dings on the doors due to extremely thin metal. The ride is very rough, even with new tires, it is noisy on the highway. The canister oil filter is a real pain to replace....had to buy a special wrench from Toyota(expensive) and is almost worn out after 6 oil changes. The backup lights are very weak and hardly provide enough light when backing up. I really dislike the touch screen to change radio stations or other activities. In daylight you cannot see the screen. The Rav is missing numerous convenience storage spaces. Poor design overall, a elementary student could have given Toyota engineers better advise. Will be buying a CRV in near future...Very disappointed."
"06 29, 2015",Road noise and Yokahama tires,"I ha d 31 X 10.50 tires on my 94 pick-up that were quieter than the Yokohamas that came on my 2013 RAV4 XLE. These tires are the noisiest I ever owned with the exception of a set of Generals. When I hit even slightly rough road these tire are so loud I can't even hear the radio. Get a set a set of Michelin's as fast as you can.
The only other problem is that the large side panels are easily marred in parking lots. The vehicle needs side bumpers so that it doesn't look beat up in a very few years.
I fixed the glare on the interior backup screen by cutting a stiff piece of thin foam board around the top and sides. It isn't pretty but serves it's purpose.
All else considered I get great mileage 32.3 and putting it in sport mode to merge on the interstate is a thrill for the day. A very good vehicle that I would recommend, I'm still a Toyota fan just wish it came with quieter tires."
"05  6, 2015",Love. This. Vehicle!,"I just purchased my new (used) Rav 4 and I love it! It corners like it's glued to the road. The drive is so comfortable and even my 6' 2"" husband can sit very comfortably in the back seat! It's a dream."
"02 11, 2015",Enjoying the RAV4 Limited,"I've been very impressed with the vehicle so far. I came from an Acura RDX, which cost considerably more, but didn't offer any more features than the RAV4 Limited - and guzzled premium gas at 20 mpg. Although the Acura was more powerful, the RAV has plenty of pickup for all daily and highway driving. Pop it into Sport mode, and you get even quicker acceleration; or maximize your mileage in Eco mode - I average 25 mpg (about 60% city). I tested this SUV against the Mazda CX-5: although the Mazda may have been slightly sportier to drive (but not much), it fell way short of the RAV4 inside. The RAV is much more comfortable, roomy, and has all the luxury features (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) that the RDX had. I love the two-tone Terra Cotta interior. On the road, the ride is a nice balance between firm and shock-absorbing; it's not a Lexus, but it's quiet enough to make hands-free calls or listen to music (without blasting), and it handles all bumps smoothly. The sound system is quite good, and the navigation is adequate, though it has trouble finding points of interest. At 23,000 miles, I've had only two very minor issues: the rear hatch auto-opening mechanism (which I LOVE) had to be replaced (under warranty) when it failed, and the dashboard has started to rattle/squeak just a little, but only when the weather is below freezing. Unless the car falls apart, I expect to be happy with the RAV for years to come."
"01  9, 2015",Not much to brag about here,"There's not much I can say about the Toyota Rav4 LE except that it's a Toyota... which might mean a lot down the road. But for now, I'm not impressed. In fact, the 2013 Rav4 LE is really more irritating to me than anything else. There are features (or a lack of features) that are downright mystifying. When in park, the car rolls forwards or backwards for a greater distance than any other car I've owned. I haven't a clue why, except be careful that there's nobody behind you or in front of you when you put it in park. Otherwise, their toes might get squished. The plastic panels along the bottom of the front doors allow for all kinds of debris, dirt, snow and grime to enter the car's lower door interior. Again, why? What on earth were the engineers thinking when they added this lower door extension with a plastic shroud? The ""spoiler"" in the back just prevents your car from getting cleaned when in a car wash. Speaking of car washes, if you don't have a roof rack, watch out; the roof rack channel trim has a tendency to ""pop"" lose when going through the car wash's blow dryer. It happened to me twice.Toyota has no recommended solution for this.
I have a black interior. Which makes it extremely difficult to see the door handles and window and door lock buttons in the dark. Buttons are not backlit for the most part when the headlights are on. The auto window feature for the driver's side works when putting the window down -- but why not a one-touch feature for putting the window back up? What's the point of that? Very deceiving are the windshield wipers. On the turn signal, Toyota shows ""INT"" for intermittent wipers. In reality, there's nothing intermittent about the wipers at all. They turn on for slow speed or fast speed. Or not at all. That's it. They are not variable timing wiper blades. What car made today does not have this as a standard feature? This is 20 year old technology. I guess the answer is Toyota. Unbelievable. How cheap can you be? Although the interior looks refined, it's cheap and is prone to scratches and I suspect poor longevity. I had a stain on the silver rim of the air vent. When I went to wip the stain off with my licked finger... the silver paint came off!! Either I have the most caustic saliva known to man or Toyota is using the cheapest silver spray paint in the world. I'm going with the latter. The muffler or tailpipe rattles in idle making it sound like you have an exhaust leak. The brakes squeak when going in reverse. Cheap rotors? The engine is noisy. The undercarriage sound proofing is deafening... deafeningly loud. The heater / AC fan barely blows out anything in positions one and two. The doors feel lightweight and cheap. The salesman said ""Hey, you gotta shave back on something in order to get better mileage."" The transmission is an oxymoron. Why would you need a six speed auto transmission for a 4 cylinder car? How much gas savings can that really bring? As a six speed transmission, it always feels like the car doesn't know what gear to be in. As a driver, I feel like the transmission might go at any minute becauseof the way the transmission behaves. Very perplexing -- and as I said previously, irritating. I could go on and on about the irritating features this car has but I'm winded from complaining. If ten years from now I enjoy a trouble-free experience with this car, I'll overlook its idiosyncrasies, but until then I'm forced to live with these ""irritating"" features."
"10 29, 2014",Lacks basic features,"Toyota has gone cheap on this SUV.
We have the SLE with Nav package. It is very hard to see on a bright day and very limited in information provided.
Back-up camera is next to useless and gets blurred if it is raining.
We spend 5 months a year in the US and our Canadian model has no way to switch from Kilometres to miles also the GPS does not give a speed read out.
There is no DC power outlet for a cooler in the back seat.
We went from a 10 year old SUV to this and don't find it has as many features."
"10 23, 2014",2013 Rav4,"I'm enjoying this car. I've had RAV 4 in the past and I'm having a great time in this one. Added features off the power moonroof, fog lights,led screen miles analysis, control heating and the added 4 wheel drive feature is great. Now I have all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive in the same vehicle. The backup camera is great. The Sport mode and Eco mode also gives 2 options of control. I'm happy finally to get back into a SUV."
"10  3, 2014",Went from a Mustang to the Rav4 and LOVING it!!,"I bought my Rav4 brand new in the end of year sales December 27th and got a great deal on the price. I get 27.3 miles per gallon and I am at times very heavy on the gas. I have put just over 16,000 miles as this is a work vehicle for me and it still runs like the first day!! When I am on the road whether its highway or city the noise is very quiet compared to having a mustang before this!! The inside plastic is a little easy to scratch and I don't like having cloth on the door where you will be touching a lot but its a car not a house. I love the back up camera, cruise control and bluetooth! Three things that don't come standard on all vehicles in its category. This car also does great in very heavy rain where roads are flooded! I wouldn't have even know I was driving on a flooded road if the water wasn't spraying everywhere!! It did GREAT!! I do wish that the windshield wipers had more than slow, fast and faster but its just a pet peeve of mine and I can get over it. Tons of legroom in the back! Love that the back seats recline too! All around this vehicle is great!!"
"09  7, 2014",Wish I had not bought it...,"I waited 7 years for a new vehicle and had my heart set on the Rav-4 or the Honda CRV. We went with the 2013 Rav-4, I loved the look of it. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought it. At the test drive, I noticed all of the hard plastic inside, but did not realize how cheap it made the interior. Within 4 weeks we had an issue with the driver's door. We were told the ""welds"" had all come loose and a new door was ordered from Canada. Then parts of the roof rack came off, we went back to the dealer and had that replaced. A month or so later, the same parts came off the roof rack again! We never used the roof rack. My vehicle was white, my 4th white vehicle, under every door handle, under the gas tank door and under the two mirrors, each time it rained, black drip marks went down the entire vehicle at each of these places. Needless to say, at 4200 miles, I was done. I traded the vehicle in. We have a 2000 Toyota Sienna and the quality of that vehicle is so much better than the 2013 Rav-4. The vehicle I had seemed to be cheaply made, and it was not a cheap vehicle. This was our 4th Toyota, it will probably be our last."
"07 20, 2014",2013 Toyota RAV4 XLE,"Might be a little soon for this, but since the car is a 2013 model and it's July 2014 it's probably a good time since I'm now the second owner of this car. I purchased the TRav over the 4th of July just before my vacation to the ocean. After a 3 hour drive there, local Ocean City driving, and 3 hours back, I'm puzzled as to why the previous owner didn't keep the vehicle. Fun to drive; carried hubby and three teens around for a week or so and no complaints. Hubby has mostly all positive things to say also. Plenty of rear seat leg room and storage in the rear, and boy did we have it loaded down. Tks Toyota for the large side mirrors. Whoever thought of their size considered people like us that have the rear stuffed to the roof and no rear view mirror visibility. I was able to compensate just fine, and plan to purchase a roof rack. Believe me this isn't a knock to the TRav, but just an idea of what we packed. ENGINE: Performance for a 4-banger is excellent. There's enough engine and transmission options (ECO boost, Sport, and the neat Standard/Auto shifting) to make me feel that I've got enough options for all driving situations, and believe me I've used them so far. It's got some serious pep and delivers quickly. Gas mileage appears to be as advertised, but I'll probably be able to extend that carpooling back and forth from work since it's mostly highway. Soooo much better than my previous vehicle. TECHNOLOGY: Ok, this will be short from me since that wasn't much of a concern during purchase (Yeah, I'm in my early 50s - it shows). Love the back up camera, awesome bluetooth, excellent audio system, and hookups for iPODs, teenager gizmos, etc. Did I mention I love the bluetooth. Never thought I'd hear myself say that. ISSUES: Lack of lumbar support for cloth seats - Hubby has back issues so he's sensitive about this. See light color under scratches in red paint, but I plan to touch up and I'm very good at that sort of thing, so don't expect it to be a big problem. 4 stars for value for the money and reliability since that would depend on how trouble free the Rav will be in the future. Given the history of the Rav I'm hoping it will warrant 5 stars in a couple of years :) Additional PLUSES: Love how Toyota has the bottom of the body covered with the plastic and integrated into the bumpers. Figure I'll need that additional protection if we have another winter full of Polar Vortexes. Thought the dash design (bump out area to the glove box) was a bit odd at first, but after traveling around I've warmed up to it because it makes fiddling with the buttons easier. Lot's of additional hidden storage for tools and space around the spare tire for additional things. I'm a chick that likes her tools. All in all, I'm very happy with this vehicle and would recommend to a friend. Almost seems as though it was made just for me :)"
"06 24, 2014",Average vehicle,"We had a 2007 highlander, great car was a hybrid and got 28mpg consistently. The 2013 Rav 4 has great looks but it stops there. It's noisy, clunky ride and worst of all overstated mileage by toyota. We have coasted, drove flat roads, been very light on the gas and the best we get is 24.1 on highway and 22.4 in town in easy suburban driving. Had 4 toyotas, 2 highlanders, camray and this is the most disappointing mileage. Would not recommend."
"05  9, 2014",Average at best,"I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is ""average"". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average. Not a bad car, but easily outclassed by several competitors in its class."
"05  3, 2014",2013 Rav4,"Had an awesome experience purchasing my very first brand new car. I worked with Umesh, who helped me find the car I wanted withing my budget."
"05  1, 2014",I love it more every day!,"I've owned by RAV4 LE for 6 months. We had lots of snow this winter. The RAV always made me feel comfortable that I had good control of the vehicle. The windshield wipers and defrost work well. The gas mileage as calculated by the onboard computer says I've averaged 27.2 miles per gallon over the first 5400 miles. My manual calculation has it at 25.1mpg. I drive around with it in eco mode most of the time. When I'm in a passing or merging situation I reach over and press the sport mode button. The transmission will immediately drop 1 to 2 gears depending on my timing with the gas pedal. I love that button. The paddle shifting option doesn't work as fast. I'm 54, my 22 year old son agrees that the sport button works best when you are mostly operating in eco mode. The low load floor with no lip and lift gate rear make loading and unloading super easy. I'm not a super tech geek, so not having the GPS or blind spot sensors, found on the more expensive models, doesn't cause me any regret. I do like the back up camera. The side mirrors are large and well placed for backing up. My first car was a 1967 Dodge Coronet with shoulders that the RAV4 also tastefully incorporates. Great visibility, very strong cornering ability (this is not a sports car), good options for controlling the acceleration vs mpg, plenty of useful space, all come together to keep me smiling. The one area that I wish it were just a bit better is the left foot rest for the driver. That is a bit small and angled wrong for me."
"04 30, 2014",2013 Rav 4 Ltd.,"Outstanding vehicle in every respect. We would highly recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, economical and fun car."
"04 19, 2014",What a neat car,"WE bought our 2013 Rav4 Limited in November 2013. We were originally there to replace our tires on our 2010 Corolla and something catches our eye in the dealership. The Rav4 had the most compelling exterior design from the chrome in the headlamps to the ""rest-your arm"" on the rear-tail light. It was quite a change from the previous generation and it has grown on us. We decided to test drive a gray colored one. The ride wasn't too bad (but we own a rough-riding sports car so we are used to some bumps) but Toyota probably made it a little firm for handling purposes. The road noise was pretty minimal and when you opened the sunroof at 50+ mph, it was a little noisy. What REALLY made up our minds to buy the car were the immense amounts of technological features that it came with. Push button start with easy door-unlocking/locking, auto-dimming rearview mirror (this is great for that annoying headlight glare during the night), the great navigation unit, the blind spot monitor system with back up assist (although we wished the blind spot monitor made a noise when you tried to change lanes into another car), the vast amount of rear cargo space, the heated seats, the high driving position, and the bluetooth connectivity. I know that was a long list, but it was totally worth mentioning because it makes this car 100 times better than base models. The only problem we had since we bought the car was the power lift gate. Here in Florida we have lots of rainstorms. Water managed to get into the power lift mechanism in the gate and caused it to have a terrible squeak aw it went up. Fortunately toyota replaced it for free and it hasn't squeaked since. I use the car daily and gas mileage could be a little better. I know its rated around 26/31 but i feel like I've been getting a little worse, maybe 22/27. The transmission can be pretty smooth but if you been in a rodeo, the chassy seems to heave and ho upon acceleration. Its not the smoothest but its do-able. Rear leg room and head roof is plenty (I'm 6'0 and i fit perfectly fine behind my driving position. The two-toned leatherette seats are comfy but seem to wrinkle a little because the seat bolsters are in the way when getting in the car, so you are rubbing against it all the time. The eco mode has terrible acceleration but that's to save gas; the sport mode is peppy and good for fast-er accelerations and overtaking on highways, however, this accounts for poor gas mileage. I use normal mode for city driving. Overall, the Rav4 is a great deal with all the features it has. A bang for your buck. I would recommend it for families that want to take a nice cross-country road trip or those who use it to commute to work. Toyota truly lives up to their slogan with this car ""Let's go places""."
"04  1, 2014",Thankfully I don't do a lot of driving...,"I drove a 2009 Rav4 LE for almost 5 years and absolutely loved it. Now that I have the new 2013 Rav4 LE, I find myself wishing at times that I still had my old one...

I was given a brand new, 15 miles on the odometer, 2013 Rav4 from the dealership just over 2 months ago. I definitely like the interior more than the 2009 version with the back up camera, touch screen display, bluetooth, etc., but I also miss a couple of the old features too. I feel like there's less storageup front and the extrerior tends to scratch very easily. A lot of plastic additions and kind of silly to see fake plastic parts where lights would go on a higher edition. I don't have a far commute to work, so my gas mileage has been pretty decent, but I've never felt 100% comfortable in the car. I didn't even get off the lot yet, before turning the car around to ask why the brakes were making noise -- I was told they had to be ""broken in"" because it was sitting on the lot for so long. Brought the car back 4 days later because the bluetooth wasn't working correctly. I was told by 2 different people (including a specialist) that they didn't know how to fix it and I needed to bring it in for service.

Fast forward 2 months and the car has less than 2,000 miles on it. Not only does the transmission and acceleration make me nervous -- down shifts very quickly and has ""jumped"" forward on a couple occassions when putting the car into reverse. The engine has also been making a ""squealing/whining"" noise since I first got it when driving below 45mph and has a difficult time driving up hill. I've had to put my foot almost to the floor for it to accelerate. I plan on bringing the car in for service in the next couple of weeks and make note of these problems.

My 2009 Rav NEVER had a problem in the 4+ years that I had it. No engine noise, comfortable, no leaks, etc. I loved that car...this new one, is not so impressive. I think Toyota is a great car, but I'll think twice about getting another Rav4 once my lease is up in 3 years."
"02 14, 2014","Oh Hello, Space Ship.","First of all, I traded in my base-model chevy coupe for my next car, so anything I purchased would far surpass it. However, the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited was the best vehicle I test drove.

Having automatic-everything for the first time worried me a bit. The more electronics in the car, the more expensive it is to fix. Since it's a lease, I'm not too concerned with this issue. I especially like that I get the opportunity to replace my key fabs twice a year if anything happens to them.

I love everything about this car, especially the Blind Spot Monitor. I didn't think I would notice the light signals in the mirrors, but the sales guy, Brian Dobbs, convinced me to get it. It proved its worth within the first week of purchasing the Rav4.

PROS: Two Power Seat Setting buttons for the driver side so both me and a second person can switch back and forth in the driver side seat with ease. Seat Warmers, All-Wheel Drive. I love how the inside lights turn on when I walk up to the car. I flipped out the first night I witnessed it. I can connect my phone via bluetooth and use the car speakers to make phone calls (super plus!). The sound quality of the phone conversation isn't bad either. It gets good mileage, almost the same as my old coupe.

CONS: I thought it was strange that there aren't rear vents for the back passengers. Since I don't drive people around on a frequent basis, I'm not sure how this affects their experience. I also think it's odd that the middle cup holders for the back passengers are inside the center arm rest. If three people sit in the back, the middle person has to hold their drink. Again, this doesn't affect my experience with the car."
"02 13, 2014",2013 rav4 diesel,"We are the proud owners of a new rav diesel and I am pleased to say that that it is a delight to drive our trip from the dealers to home on the freeway averaged 5.5L/100 km and is whisper quite .Cannot fault the fit and finish however some brands like Hyundai put more effort into upholstery detail .We are stepping out of a 2002 s60 volvo and we find the seats to almost as good as the volvo .
It represented a more practical car than a hybrid vehicle .
With the vehicle set on cruise control 100 km/ hour on country roads it was un stoppable having mountains of toque to negotiate steep inclines.."
"02 10, 2014",Enjoying my Rav4 xle,"I have had my Rav4 XLE almost 3 weeks. LOVE IT, fun to drive. I had a Ford Edge and the gas milage was killing me. So happy Toyota changed the style of the exterior."
"02  1, 2014",one of the best car's I have ever owned,"This car is just the right size. Performs very well. I get great gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25 miles per gallon. It handles great in the snow. That is the number one reason I bought the Rav 4. I wanted all wheel drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. from the great sounding radio to the blind spot monitor, the backup screen, and the nav system and of course the Bluetooth for my phone and music. I really like the apps, such as Pandora.

Overall, this is one of the best cars I have ever owned and would recommend it. Toyota's service is second to none and that is extremely important in owning this vehicle."
"01 28, 2014",Hold On,"I have owned my Rav4 for six months and have owned many different cars and trucks in almost
50 years of driving . This is by far the vehicle with
the worst ride I have ever owned."
"01 21, 2014",Great Car,"I love my 2013 rav4 xle. Bought for my wife and wished it was for me. Great mileage and great exterior body. The only negatives is no leather or heated seats. camera works good when it doesn't snow or rain. Love the touchscreen on the dash. very impressed, i'm a honda person and glad i didn't buy crv. I live in Virginia and drive to Kansas and myrtle beach once a year. Drive for fun to D.C., Richmond alot. Love the white paint."
"01  1, 2014",Good car but Toyota cutting corners from earlier m,"I traded in my 2010 Rav4 for the 2013 model so I feel I can make a valid comparison. My 2010 LTD was a V6 so I knew going in that I was giving up excellent acceleration for a s0-so 4 cyl. But when considered against the new features of the 2013 I decided to trade it in. I got tired of the large swing door and lack of technology as found in the newer models. But here's where they cut some corners:
1. The spare tire is now inside (nice) but is no longer a full size tire and wheel but a temp.
2. The 2010 had real leather seats, now they employ something called ""soft-tek"" leather substitute.
3. The center console no longer two levels, just one large box.
4. On the 2010 there was a secondary glove box that had a push button release. Replaced by an open bin.
5. The interior and dashboard use more cheap looking plastic and no one will be fooled into thinking the carbon fiber surface is real.
6. One less 12V outlet and no 110V a/c outlet.

Even with all of the above, I don't regret buying this car. It's a good reliable vehicle with some nice technology. The price is lowest in it's class and the mileage is great. I get 28 mpg overall and it uses regular gas. However, if they brought back the V6 I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"12 22, 2013",You can't Make This Up,"Stranded at the dealership with a Uhaul in tow I asked the Sales guy to take me on a test drive with something comparable to my luxury vehicle which just decided to ""break up with me"". He suggested a Toyota Rav 4 Limited and I laughed saying I don't think so. I wanted comfort, a smooth ride, leather heated seats, auto seat adjustment with memory, navigation, performance with some get up and go. And decent gas mileage. No way was I expecting this in the Rav4 but I was wrong. Words that do not normally come out of my mouth. The Rav4 Limited is Awesome! Great ride, super cool looking, the performance is far beyond what I expected. Hugs the corners, has some power for a 4 Cylinder when in the Sport Mode. Surprising sound system, navigation and voice commend system is very nice and easy to use. Got a lot in this vehicle without the high ticket price of it's well known luxury model that I use to drive. Surprise, surprise. I love my Toyota Rav4 Limited."
"12 18, 2013",Honest Review 2013 RAV4 XLE AWD,"Let me start by saying that this may in fact be the right car for some but I will tell you about my experience with my current RAV4.
We found the Rav4 attractive for numerous reasons. We liked the overall styling of the exterior, though more black plastic than I liked but this seems to be a way for car manufactures to make some extra savings. I worried about it fading over time, which it will. I wasn't a fan of the rear end and I still do not care for it. this wasn't a deal breaker for me because what the exterior lacked the interior made up for it.
You get a lot of standard features on the XLE and that is why we chose it. Automatic Dual climate controls, roof rails, touch scree, back up cam, neat two tone color fabric, and so on.
We compared this to the escape (to small) and the CRV (noisy over the road).
PROs: smooth power train and enough power for the whole family. Me +3. roomy seating for all unless you squeeze 3 in the back. It's REALLY tight with three! Great cargo room even with the stroller. Road noise is minimal for this class compared to the competition. Nice interior and decent exterior.
This is why I'm rating this car so low and I have lost a lot of respect for Toyota quality.
CONS: The fake carbon fiber scratches extremely easy but the Toyota dealership replaced the scratched piece. Pretty nice of them. The ride is absolutely terrible! We did our initial test drive over some pretty smooth roads but once we got to driving it (after purchase) on other less improved surfaces, the ride was very noticeable. I'm pretty sure it's the rear suspension as it crashes over the smallest imperfections. The hood shakes and rattles all the time no matter the speed. There is a ""whine"" noise coming from the transmission when slowing down from 45+ mph. I also have some oil residue developing around the valve cover gasket. Toyota cannot find a leak. The transmission has a hard time on hills. Cruising at 70 mpg and climbing up a grade will case the transmission to downshift very hard once it finally engages. So hard that it woke my sleeping passengers and them asking if we hit something. All of these issues were brought to the dealerships attention and Toyota corporate. After several weeks and the car staying at the dealer for over two weeks, Toyota was unable to identify any problems. They took note of it and agreed with my complaints but say that these are characteristics of this vehicle. TOn top of all this, the bolts to the back hinge struts for the gate are developing rust and it is creating a rust streak down the column. Got to take it back to the dealer for this... yay, yet again.
After all of this I am pursuing the arbitration process and will try to get my money back. I cannot recommend this vehicle to anyone until they address these common issues with this model. Do a quick search or look on the forums and you will find I'm not the only with theses exact same problems.
I hate to say this, because I'm a Toyota fan, but do not buy this vehicle. If you choose to take anyways, PLEASE look for the problems I'm having as many others are experiencing the same. It's not worth it.... even for a Toyota."
"12  7, 2013",Car buying experience on a reliable car,The Toyota scion dealership in Apex NC made my car buying experience really smooth and fast. There was no pressure nor any hidden fees. I am very satisfied with overall experience. I will definitely recommend this place for new car buyers to try it out.
"11 28, 2013",Disappointed new RAV 4 owner,"I purchased a 2013 RAV 4 XLE with great expectations. What attracted me to this car was the exterior styling, well laid out and functional interior, back up camera, six speed automatic transmission, fairly peppy speed especially from the starting position, and good value for the price.

My disappointment has been the rear suspension ""slamming"" when driving over even modest speed bumps and breaks in the road, choppy transmission shifts especially in stop and go driving, loud muffler, and that incessant high pitched winding sound when accelerating that is so common to all Toyotas.

Of course when I asked the dealer to check out these aggravations, they predictably said it was ""normal"".

I previously owned a 2008 Honda CR-V and now wish I went with my gut and purchased a 2013 Honda CR-V.

I hope someone in authority from Toyota reads this review, takes it seriously, and start to make corrections to an otherwise very fine car."
"11 22, 2013","Nicest, and maybe last, car I've owned","RAV4 is roomy, with lots of extras standard; wouldn't have asked for Bluetooth or sun roof, but nice to have. Gas mileage is what Toyota posted, Solid feel, handles fine, peppy enough especially with EcoMode turned off (which we only do to get on the freeway). We drive cars for 10 years & 200,000 miles; hope this car will go at least that long."
"11  9, 2013",great deal,yours to discover this professionals and unbelievable sales representatives and great deal. and great car.
"11  8, 2013",Everything I needed and more,"Rides like a dream, turns on a dime... OK maybe a sliver dollar but tight. Gas mileage was excellent and it handles well in city and Long road trips. Entune is easy to set up and the auto seat settings for each driver is sure handy.

There is one minor disappointment, a nit ... that I've experienced in this superb vehicle - no built in garage door opener/Home Link capability.. Yep!!! Limited package I bought had all upgrades plus the dealer is so confident I received an extra year of No Cost Maintenance. And have we got room to spare. Moved 2 cats and a parrot 1200 miles easily. Get one of your own."
"11  6, 2013",5th Toyota,"I believe that Toyota missed the boat when they designed the interior. I have a 2013 RAV 4 LE with cloth seats. Seats are uncomfortable. The front seat head rests are as hard as a 2X4. They light grey put cloth on the inside of the door panels where ones hand touches every time the door is opened. I can just imagine what it will look like the first time a greasy auto mechanic opens or closes the door. Every time I make a right turn, I change the radio station or go to Bluetooth. The buttons to control the radio are too close to the outside of the steering wheel."
"10 25, 2013",Toyota - What a Joke,"I purchased my 3rd RAV4 this year in June 2013. Driven over 5,000 miles and Toyota you've totally let me down.
Primary uses: Commuting to work, shuttling kids to activities, going on trips to camp, bike, hike and kayak.

Performance:
The ECO mode is a joke - for my driving (mix of country roads, city and hwy) I get better gas mileage in normal mode. One would think going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would get better gas mileage. NOT! Worse gas mileage than my 2010. You would think they would work to improve it not go the other way.
Responsiveness and performance is sluggish at best. When accelerating to get on the highway, constantly have the RPMs at 4 or 5 ? Never had this issue in my old RAV?s. I also drive my mother?s Subaru Forester which drives and handles extremely better than this RAV in ?normal? mode. If you put it in ECO mode it is even worse. Mode (Sport,Eco) Buttons are not convenient and are a safety hazard to switch to Sport mode for those times I have to accelerate fast to merge onto the highway.

Features:
? Satellite is flaky. In my last RAV it worked like a charm and we really enjoyed it, now it cuts in and out. Dealership told me ?that is just the way Satellite works?. Umm, driving the same routes no I don?t think your answer is correct.
? Bluetooth constantly reboots my phone and is unusable. Again the dealership said can?t be the RAV it?s the phone; tried 3 other phones and still does the same thing. Phone company checked phones (Motorola and LG) and said no issues.
? Like the automated hatch, have not had the problems others seem to mention with piston failure.
? Rearview camera is the bomb.

Exterior Styling:
? Good copy of Mazda and Hyundai and others. No originality. Have gone from leader of the pack to follower.
? Can't believe the paint has mildewed!

Interior Styling:
? TOTALLY miss the storage compartment that was taken away to house the spare tire. Must less functional storage capability. Used this feature a lot in my old RAV to store chairs, purchases, etc.
? Miss the additional plugs behind the console for the rear seat and in the rear of the vehicle.
? Some controls are easy to reach for my short arms, others are hidden or hard to reach.
? Overall feels downgraded.

Value for the Money:
Should have gone with Subaru or Mazda. Looking to trade it in for another vehicle."
"10 23, 2013",Toyota's-all,"I have had several Toyota cars and pickup and they have all been good.

I do wish you had kept the swing door, much easier to open for a women or make all of them with power tailgate"
"10 20, 2013",I'm lovin' it,"I like the feel of the size of RAV, the finish is outstanding , the navigation and the entertainment systems CONS:difficult to read the gauges especially outside temp (passengers like to know the temp as well )Heated seats do not have variable settings."
"10 14, 2013",2014 RAV4 - The Best Car ... so far,"I purchased a Rav4 in March 2013 - I love It! I previously owned a Nissan, and 2 Honda Civics; but so far this is the best. My only concern is I am not seeing the Metallic Green on the color chart;... is it that they are not making it any longer...?"
"10  7, 2013",2013 Toyota Rav4! Fun to drive!,"Hello, having driven a 2005 Nissan Maxima for nearly 9 years and 215K+ miles, it was time to move to a something different. I knew that I was tired of driving a sedan and wanted something with solid gas mileage, stylish, fun to drive yet sat higher up than I was use to. Enter the 2013 Rav4.

What a great little SUV. It's a head turner, believe it or not. Gets great gas mileage, has a smooth ride, is very fun to drive and has lots of room for all types of things. Sorry for the short review, but i highly recommend it."
"10  5, 2013",moving from a Camry to RAV4,"I am enjoying the RAV4, Only one problem and that it is cuts out occasionally so I will have to take it back to a dealer to have that item checked. Dealer Bountiful Toyota, was excellent in every way. Friendly, efficient and wanted to meet my needs in a car."
"09 25, 2013",Broke 6 days after purchase,"This is my third Toyota vehicle.
I had been a long believer of Toyota quality until now.
I had all my maintenance and services done at Toyota on my previous vehicles and have the stamp book to prove it.

It had been less than a week since I purchased my 2013 RAV4 and took it off the lot

I was unloading the trunk when the hatch fell on me.
The right arm holding the hatch came straight off the door and took some paint with it on the way down.

I know I am not the only 2013 RAV4 owner with this issue because there are several online forums that mention this.
I also know there is an updated version of the piston for the hatch available.

I have been in contact with the dealer and Toyota to get the car fixed.The dealer took the defective piston, compressed it, and put it right back onto the hatch.They didn't put the updated pistons on or even a new one.

Toyota also stated that they will not replace the defective piston unless they issue a recall. They said I will have to wait until it breaks again.

The 2013 RAV4 is a nice looking car, but Toyota customer service and quality have fallen a long way."
"09 24, 2013",Fun to Drive,"I was worried about the 4 cylinder, but this car has some spunk. I really enjoy driving it. It has a ""Sport"" button when you want to waste gas and an ""Eco"" button for when you want to save gas. Who could ask for more? Steering feels good, too. I think I made a good decision.

I haven't had it very long, so reliability is based on Toyota's pedigree."
"09 24, 2013",Not Powerful Enough,"The 4-cylinder engine in the new Rav4 is way too small. Why did Toyota do away with the 6? Highway driving is difficult as there's not nearly enough power. The new design also gives this vehicle a very cheap feel. I used to have a 2010 Rav4 with the V6, and this new one is about five steps down! Yes, you will get Toyota reliability, but that's about it. If you liked the wood panneled station wagons in the 80s, then you will love the new Rav4."
"09 23, 2013",This 2014 RAV 4 model is a Flop for Toyota,"My Toyota Sequoia was in the body shop for a minor accident and the rental car service provided me with a 2014 RAV 4 Base Model in black color. The Exterior design is flawless but when it came to the interior design, Toyota lost it big time. I drove this suv for a total of 200+ miles in a couple of days and here is my honest review on it. The front seats are very uncomfortable, hard and short and you want to get out of it after driving 30 minutes. Forget about taking the long interstate trips in this RAV 4. It is also very jumpy and I thought may be the tires are over inflated but I was wrong. The engine noise and road noise is loud and feels like you have a window open somewhere in the suv. Everything you touch inside the cabin feels hard plastic. The middle armrest between the front seats is a joke and Toyota should have done a better job in designing this armrest and more comfortable cushioned seats considering long trips that buyers might take in this suv. The standard rear view camera is a Big Plus. The Eco drive mode did save on the gas. The sports mode is fun to drive only if you do short driving. I was considering buying this 2014 RAV 4 but after my driving experience I say No Thank you ! So if you are interested in buying this 2014 RAV 4, my advice is to go and rent it and drive it around for a couple of days. If you think you still like it then its your choice but don't go to the dealership for a short test drive and then be stuck with it."
"09 22, 2013",Interesting new technology,I recently downgraded from a VW Routan minivan to RAV4. The car is very stylish and still roomy. The Pandora Box and Traffic apps are very interesting. The car is very comfortable and has good pickup. Very easy to park compared to a large minivan. I like the push start instead of a traditional key.
"09 19, 2013",jgolfski,"This vehicle is good looking, economical, and fuel efficient. the limited has the technology that vehicles costing $10,000 more have. One great car!!!"
"09 18, 2013",Rides too harsh!,"Toyota did a very good job on most of this vehicle. I leased a 13 xle and have had the it 6 months now. At first, the ride seemed firm but it starts to wear you out after a period of time. I do a lot of city driving and this vehicle lets you feel and hear everything on the road. It really takes away from an otherwise nice vehicle. The good side is city gas mileage...23-24 good...the exterior, everyone makes nice comments. I have had the vehicle in some nasty storms and it was a trooper. The engine is noisy but plenty of power. The transmission is top notch and the pseudo manual is really good and easy . No problems and that's what i expect from
Toyota, the harsh ride is just too much to take. Thank goodness, i found an excellent seat cushion for it. At the end of the lease, it's going back...too bad, it could have been great. Also, Toyota needs to fix the touch screen. It's easy to operate but in the sun, your on your own. You can't see a thing on it...."
"09 18, 2013",Better Size Engine/MPG than the other SUV's.,"I looked for over 6 months and primarily focused my interest on the Honda CRV because of it's size and style inside. Then when I came across the 2013 new RAV4, there were only two things that caught my eye: 2.5L engine and 30mpg gas. A bigger engine with better gas mileage? Cool! Took the test drive - there are 3 models and two wheelbase sizes 17 inch in the Base and XL model and 18 inch tires for the Limited. I test drove both - the 18 inch drove much smoother (the new car is stocked with Bridgestone tires). I like the drive, the features and room (especially the backseat) of the Limited. However, the engine is an electronic 6 speed that does make a ""wining"" noise when accelerating. The radio drowns it out. The car is fast, good acceleration, good gas mileage and nice interior (it's not real leather - it's a imitation leather, according to the dealership, because it is lighter and more humane than using real leather. Everything about the car is focused on ""lightness."" of all aspects - body, engine, transmission, etc., which all leads to better gas mileage for the bigger engine. Works for me!"
"09 16, 2013",Poor interior design,"Top glove box no door?
front console area only has one side, things fall onto floor,
no auto headlights, can't see display in sunlight,
we purchased an XLE, it came with a sun roof, but you can't get a power seat or leather or interior hatch release.
Mechanically it is Toyota, but the interior design and options are from another world. We tried a limited but that Softex is a poor substitute for leather."
"09 12, 2013",Bigger engine - better gas mileage than other SUVs,"I looked for 6 months for my first SUV; looked at Honda CRV....wanted style, gas mileage, bigger engine and a reasonable price for the model. I test drove the CRV but didn't like the handling or road noise. I had a Toyota Solara for over ten years so I knew about the Toyota quality. I looked at the New RAV 4 and what caught my eye was 1) size of interior ; 2) bigger engine than the CRV (2.5L vs 2.4) but it got better gas mileage! Rides like a car. With the Limited model you get 18-inch, vs 17 -inch tires on the base or XLE model. The engine is a 6 speed electronic that whines a bit. Eco option is a gas saver. Gets approx 24 mpg city. No road noise with the 18 inch tires. A little more with 17 inch. Great back seat space and good storage space in the back...LOVE IT!!"
"09 12, 2013",Short Life!!!!,"We have a 2006 RAV 4 and yes, we have 170,000 miles on it. But it should last for a lot longer. It uses a quart of oil every 600 miles and the transmission has just gone out. We have all the maintenance records with the dealership and drive very, very mildly. We have found blogs on other web sites having the same issues we have so if you want to get a vehicle to last 200,000+ miles, it's not the RAV 4!!!!"
"09  8, 2013",Beautiful SUV,Excellent value for the money. I love the 3 different driving modes and the gas mileage.and the roomy interior. I have the CR-v no comparison .
"09  8, 2013",Crashed,"Just got the RAV4 and had a horrific crash into a semi , whole front , and rt. door torn off . Most people would be dead in this type of crash . All 8 airbags saved them from injury. The RAV 4 saved my family , they walked away from a certain death ."
"09  4, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited,"Toyota hit a homerun with the 2013 RAV4. From the minute I test drove mine I was hooked. I love the comfort of the seats and having ""all"" the controls on the steering wheel cuts down on distractions. It's just a well thought out SUV. I love the NAV system it is very easy to use even for a fifty something guy like me. I bought it and the same day I drove it 300 miles across Texas."
"08 19, 2013",happy with purchase,I'm pleasantly surprised with the mpg I'm getting. I average 32.5 mpg (75% highway). I use the ECO mode only. No problems so far and I currently have 4000 miles. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable awd that drives like a car and gets really impressive gas milage.
"08 15, 2013",Poor Gas Mileage,"We purchased the 2013 two wheel drive Rav4 in July and have put about 2500 miles on it so far. We always drive it in Eco mode and have yet to get anywhere close to the stated mileage for the vehicle. Consistently it is getting 26 mpg (not 31 mpg as stated on the sticker) on the highway (driving 75mph with a/c on). We are careful to accelerate slowly in order to get the best gas mileage we can, but to no avail. In the city, we are getting 22 mpg. There again, we are not making rapid accelerations nor quick stops. My Toyota dealer just says, ""hu"" and has no answers. The only reason we sold our 4Runner, was to get a more efficient car and by going to the Rav4, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped."
"08 11, 2013",excellent fuel economy,"GREAT M.P.G ,after topping off the tank ,took a 105 mile road trip & got a whopping 42 miles per gallon with the eco switch on ......... yes 42 mpg ,with 4 people in the vehicle ...... 105 miles used 2.5 gallons of regular fuel . after topping it off again we used it around town somewhat city driving and retopped to find that we got 34 mpg city . so I did some investgating and found that Toyota wasn't able to check the fuel economy with the eco button on and hadn't any idea what difference it would make . lol THANKS TOYOTA !!"
"08  9, 2013",Best car I've owned yet!,"This car has the best safety ratings and feul economy for small SUVs. It also has great suspension, the car will glide over train tracks. It has comfortable seats and an awesome back up camera.

I received wonderful customer service from Toyota of Murfreesboro, especially Gus who sold me the car. All of the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car. I would refer anyone there.

Toyota offers a lifetime warrenty on 2013 vehicles, with 2 yr/2400mile maintenace package for free."
"07 27, 2013",Great Car!,"Traded in my Lexus ES for the Rav Limited. Wanted better mileage and more cargo room. Have had car for about 5 months. In ECO get 30 mpg in town, 29 this summer with AC. Have not tried the Sport mode yet.

I like the interior, think the seats are easier to maintain than leather. Interior design works just fine for me, easy controls, apps are great. The Blind Side Monitoring is fantastic, especially when backing out of a parking space. The back up camera screen is great. But I will say, I like the one in my husband's Toyota truck better as the camera screen is on the mirror.

The 2 year free maintenance is a plus as is Toyota reliability. Keyless door locks are so convienient .

One thing I would have liked is an adjustable passenger seat. Small thing I guess but Toyota should have added that, especially on the Limited.

I did test drive a KIA sedan and found it noisy, and cheap feeling. Have had the Lexus RX, IS, ES so that is all I really have to compare the Rav to and I find this car just fine. I like the road feel, being able to see better on all sides, mileage, interior, nice exterior style. Apps work great too, Bluetooth wonderful."
"07 22, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited AWD is OK with some issues,"We've driven nothing but Toyotas since 1968 (a Corona). For my needs, the ""Limited"" trim package was a good value and worth the cost. The RAV4 replaced a Camry XLE V6. The styling is fine (especially the power rear hatch) and interior room is good. The solid black interior is much nicer than the odd two-tone alernatives. Seat comfort in the driver's seat with the faux-leather is OK thanks to the lumbar support, but the lack of a power passenger seat seems cheap. The NAV system is easy to operate. Overall gas mileage has been better than the EPA estimate. The interior trim (mainly the center console) has too much hard/flimsy cheap-feeling pastic. The 2.5 engine performs well whether in eco or sport mode - I keep the vehicle in eco mode all the time. Overall, I view my new RAV4 as one of the better Toyotas I've owned."
"07  1, 2013",Rav 2013 review,"Just picked up our 2013 Rav Limited last week.
In our 2011 Rav there was a space to the right of the steering wheel where I could keep change.

No outlet in back seat for kids hand held games.

Nav screen to flat should pitch to drivers side.

No power seat on passenger seat.

No real spare tire."
"06 30, 2013",good small SUV,"Good design, good mileage, good price and fun to drive. I got a very good deal from Matia Toyota dealer in Sacramento, CA.
I have been shopping for some many Toyota dealer throughout Ca."
"06 26, 2013",Great Improvement,"Was considering an SUV but never paid much attention to the RAV4. When I saw the 2013 I loved the style and especially the new rear hatch. Some reviewers were concerned about performance, I can tell you there is a distinct difference driving in Sport Mode VS ECO Mode. This one is a true winner, Great Value. The XLE upgrade over the base model is well worth the small cost increase."
"06 15, 2013",New Rav4,"I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage with a 2013 year, I had a 2003 Nissan Altima and could expect at least 30 mpg on the highway. I'm 2 or 3 miles lower with a newer car, maybe it will get better, I hope"
"06  7, 2013",good car,"Great resale value, comfortable, easy to use, good fuel economy, and great sales person (kyle). I recommend this car highly!"
"06  6, 2013",Wonderful Experience at Toyota of Greensburg,"Bought a Rav 4 at Toyota of Greensburg and was treated wonderfully. Zach Guy my sales person and Brian the sales manager gave me a great deal on my trade and a great discount on the new vehicle. If you're thinking of buying a new Toyota stop in at Toyota of Greensburg, you won't be disappointed."
"06  1, 2013",RAV4,Gas milage seems to be very good. The standart back-up camera is extremely helpful when paralel parking. Seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room in the back seats. Ample cargo area. Surprisingly good pick-up when merging onto a highway. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
"05 26, 2013",lack of highway power,"took for a long test drive. city driving was ok, had enough power but when i took it on the highway and put it to the floor it was powerless. didnt have the power to jump over in the passing lane without getting run over. i was very dissapointed since i was ready to purchase. oh well, ill keep looking"
"05  6, 2013",Nice Ride,"Bought a 2013 RAV4 XLE. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip and averaged over 35 MPG traveling 65-70 MPH. It was a quiet, smooth ride. Very Happy with it. The only thing I would like is a more versatile center console that fits a cup with a handle, and maybe a more solid hood. Over rough roads the hood flexes some. It is a minor issue, just an aesthetics type thing. No regrets buying it so far."
"05  6, 2013",First new car for me,"I was looking to replace a 13 year old Toyota Camry. I originally looked at the prius, camry, honda civic, honda insight. I saw the new Rav4 and took it for a drive.

It was comfortable and loved the XLE trim upgrade for only $700. Well worth it.

The Econ mode lets me ge 38 MPG on the highway driving 55MPH on flat roads.

The SUV is extremely comfortable and hold all my gear and can carry my two kayaks on the roof racks.

I love the electronics. Ipod connects both bluetooth and through usb cable.

I love this car. Thinking about buying another one to replace my wifes Honda element."
"05  5, 2013",Best small suv,"The changes made to the 2013 are excellent. I would have bought a Honda CRV if Toyota had not changed the lift gate and spare tire. I waited four months for the RAV4 to get manufactured and delivered to local dealerships. It was worth the wait! I bought the Limited model and love the options that come on that model. I have had the vehicle three weeks and have been getting excellent gas milage. There is nothing that I don't like about the vehicle.
Bob S"
"05  2, 2013",Best Small SUV,"Traded a 2012 GMC Terrain for the 2013 Rav 4 XLE. Love everything about this vehicle. The mpg is excellent, fun to drive, very comfortable and amble cargo area. This is a great value ... you will not be disappointed."
"04 22, 2013",So far execellent,"Confusing instruments= seems to cover all I need to know,
Not used to the system !! Used to larger autos but seems to do all that I require and fun to drive. I'm happy with the TOY!!"
"04 11, 2013",Love this car,I had a ford escape before and decided to try Toyota. This Toyota Rav4 is Great. I could not ask for a better car. I heard that Toyota was a great company but Wow am I impressed. I love everything about it
"04 11, 2013",Top Notch Small SUV,"I'm one of those people that need to research everything to the nth degree before I purchase.
I researched and test drove many small SUV's.......

For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4.

I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle.
The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's.

Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"
"04  3, 2013",the best car I ever had,"We bought our first Toyota RAV 4in 2007.....For 5 years we had no problem at all..but we lost IT.in SANDY...and we had no doubts that we should buy again RAV 4,,model of 2013....The car that we had before our first RAV 4_ was Land Rover...and it was not that reliable like TOYOTA .RAV 4...."
"03 20, 2013",First SUV,"I started my purchasing process setting up with a buying service and using an insurance company's recommendations. I had no intention of purchasing a Toyota, in fact I was opposed to the idea. I'm still surprised I purchased one.

I had test driven the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-5, Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox, Lincoln MKX, Subaru Outback, and Forester.

I needed a car like ride, and room for several suitcases or crates in the back, I wanted AWD, leather heated seats and good MPG. Didn't think I'd get all that.

There are a lot of good choices, I do believe I could have been happy with several of these.
I bought an AWD Limited with no additional options.

the pluses of the RAV4:
* bluetooth, it works flawlessly. Didn't expect to have that standard
*Nice ride, quiet cabin.
* I'm averaging 27 mpg (1500 miles) though I drive aggressively. When driving in eco mode and being mindful of mpg, I can get 31 mpg.
*AWD was perfect for our recent snows. I drove it in 6"" of fresh unplowed snow. It's surefooted.
*keyless entry. . With gloves on in winter it's just so much easier.
*the 2 tone interior looks great.
*great ride, even in the back seats.
*Plenty of leg room for my tall family.

Negs:
*so so stereo. (3 others were far better) I did not get Nav. or the stereo upgrade My previous car had a better stereo. It's 8 yrs old too. A new stereo on their top tier style should sound better.

* The dealers all advertise the seats in the Rav4 Limited as leather. They are NOT. I'd decided on the Rav4 after driving the Honda. That dealer told me the Rav4 seating was a synthetic/leather blend. After researching the Softex I called the salesman on it, he then checked on it and it's synthetic. I felt deceived. I can't believe they don't know it's not leather. I went to 3 dealers and heard the same thing.
(I asked for and received an additional price cut by the dealer, for their mistake.) . I do like the feel of the Softex, and hope it lasts like leather."
"03 18, 2013",Great Car,Keep making Great cars and trucks for generations to come!!! Will have 3 kids needing cars in the next few years
"03  8, 2013",Third Rav4,"We leased a 2006, purchased a 2010 and just got the 2013. The 2006 had a 6 which could make your nose bleed when punching it at a light...whee. All were reliable with no issues. The only complaint(s) are we miss the dual lid on the console storage box, the sliding cover on the upper dash storage shelf and the sunglasses storage in the roof. The backup camera is awesome as is the Bluetooth sync for your phone. We got a little organizer for the console storage and are looking for some kind of box for the open dash shelf. With only 500 miles we are getting better mileage than the 2010."
"03  7, 2013",Happy so far,"Have owned only 3 weeks but am happy with my choice. Was also seriously considering a Honda CRV and looked at several other crossovers (every make has one and they all look about the same). Preferred the RAV4 XLE (FWD, cloth seats) exterior and interior design and the timing chain (vs. CRV's belt which requires major $ to replace at 80,000 miles). Also dealer provided lifetime powertrain warranty at no additional cost. Toyota made some nice improvements on the 2013 model vs. prior ones. Hopefull still one of the most reliable cars made."
"03  5, 2013",First New Vehicle Purchased,"My husband and I took the plunge and bought our first New Vehicle EVER after our beloved Jeep rolled over 200k miles and ceased to be as reliable as we wished. We did a ton of lot shopping and test driving before finally making a deal with the very professional staff at Rouen Toyota in Maumee, OH. Our salesman Byron was top notch and spent a lot of time showing me all of the features of my new Rav4. He was knowledgable, patient, and kind toward our children. I would recommend this dealership, Byron, and our new SUV to everyone. The Rav4 has the fuel economy we'd been lacking and the space we've grown accustomed to with our Jeep and Tundra Pickup. A good price and a zippy vehicle for my everyday commute."
"03  4, 2013",RAV 4 Limited,This car drives and handles much better then Honda CR-V EX-L. Can't go wrong for the price and reliability rating. if your are in compact SUV market consider this car.
"02 28, 2013",Looks like the rest performs like a dog,"A long time Toyota RAV owner and fan, this car was a huge disappointment. All the hype AROUND THE LATE REVEAL...LOOKS LIKE ALL THE REST IN ITS CLASS! Performance....felt like I could run faster and the ""engine sounds and performance says cheap""...not the sticker...very disappointed...will take a look at some others..suggest you do the same and compare before you buy!"
"02 27, 2013",lovin' my new car,"When looking for a new car I knew I wanted a small SUV. I looked at a few different makes and models from other dealerships. I absolutely fell in love with the 2013 Rav4. Just this year they came out with the new Rav4 without the tire on the back of it. It is just a beautiful car inside and out. It might be a small SUV but has a ton of room inside and the back seats even recline! The only thing that they could improve on is the back speakers. They are in the door and its hard to hear anything in the back, other than that, I love everything about it."
"02  9, 2013",Best Looking little SUV.,Reliable SUV. Just right. Smooth ride. Love the new hatch back door. Blessed to own one. Was waiting for Toyota to make pop up back door without the tire on the door. Got one right away.
"01 19, 2013",RAV4 - Much improvement!,"I disagree with the reviewer that removing the 3rd Row option from the RAV4 was a mistake. It was silly to offer such an option in a small SUV - not even a child could fit. I'm sure demand was very low so Toyota made a wise business decission.

I just purchased a 2013 yesterday and I love the new design. I had a 2010 4 Cylinder RAV4 before and have always been happy with the 4 Cylinder. I have driven a V6 in the past and did not see the need for a V6 in this car. I have plenty of power and in the new RAV4, I have Eco and Sport mode.

Hurry out and test drive one. I love my Display Audio and the Bluetooth setup in about 60 seconds."
"11  4, 2023",The RAV4 is the best running car I’ve ever had.,I love my 2013 RAV4. It runs great. I haven’t had any problems with it. The key is to always keep up the maintenance  Toyota makes the best cars.
"03  5, 2023",2013 Rav4,"Car is very reliable, i have had it almost 10 years. It has 155,000 mi
Have replaced the normal things like brakes and tires. It has a stiff ride, changed shocks and struts and still stiff. which is the #1 disappointment. Between 45 and 55 it has a bad vibration.."
"11 25, 2022",Terrible handling/ride,Worst ride ever. CD player had to be repaired. Battery needed to be installed. Dealership held back on providing problems. Probably my fault for not asking. Just relied on the  Toyota name. Headlights  were foggy and should have been improved .Defect in left front fender. Needed a wheel alignment. I could go on. I was the fool.
"09  9, 2022",I had to replace bulbs several times.,"2013 RAV4 I bought this small SUV with 25,000 miles. This car is Mexico/Canada build. I am gonna keep it short when this car passed the 105,000 miles started to fall apart( literally). The car is “affordable “ because it is built with cheap parts, and replacement are very expensive. I had to replace shock absorbers, many lights, and TRANSMISSION."
"04  5, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable,"Interior and exterior appearance are just perfect. It has plenty of power and provides a smooth ride in any weather condition.
We have owned this car for 4 years and will keep it for another 4 years at least."
"12 14, 2020",Glad to be back in a Toyota.,We had an older RAV4 and when looking for another vehicle knew we wanted to check out something newer.   Toyota has door a good job in updating the look and comfort without compromising the performance.   Happy to have given another RAV4 a home.
"09  4, 2020",The nicest comfortable vehicle so far,"this car meets all I  need in a vehicle, roomy, comfortable , allot of power, and not to complicated. great handling car , smooth ride. I would buy another."
"08 16, 2020",Reliable Small SUV,"We have 50,000 miles on this car.    So far no defects.    Fabric seats hard to clean.  We get 24 city and 28 highway mpg from the base 4 cylinder engine.   A bit noisy on long trips."
"05 30, 2020",Not a car for comfort or room,"This car is extremely uncomfortable, very stiff over bumps. It doesn't have a lot of room inside and nothing makes sense to me. It's just too bad because Toyota has always been one of my favorite vehicles. But they really did a horrible job on this one. I would never get a rav 4 again after that."
"05 24, 2020","Safe, durable reliable.","The Rav-4 is a great SUV for folks who have long winter commutes. The safety features just keep getting better and that truly matters. You can expect to put 300,00 miles on the speedometer with very few repairs."
"05 19, 2020",Beautiful car,"This car exceeds my expectations so far.  Rides beautifully, quiet, and smooth.  Definitely enjoy driving this vehicle.  Good gas mileage and a good solid, reliable car that comes highly recommended by my mechanic."
"05 18, 2020",Love the car,Haven't driven it long but so far I love it. It's comfortable and drives great. I like the compact look but still is roomy inside.
"04 22, 2020",Overall Great Car,"This was the first car I have purchased. A limited edition Toyota RAV4. It has leather seats, sunroof, and is a beautiful cherry red color. I love everything about this car but I wish the screen inside the car looked a little more updated. But can't be too picky considering it is a 2013. I am love with this car. Also drives very smoothly and has good pick me up. Would recommend this car to anyone."
"03 30, 2020",It is exactly the right car for me.,"This car is easy for me to get in and out of.  It suits my needs, is easy to park, and has been so reliable.  I've received many compliments on it since it was new, even from strangers in the grocery store parking lot."
"03 23, 2020",reliable and dependable car,"the suv meet the need of my daughter day to day commute from home to work and to do some run around.i will highly recommed this suv to any one that need a reliable car, economy and fuel efficient."
"03 22, 2020",Gray Phantom,"I thoroughly enjoy this car. It's comfortable, easy to drive, dependable, sporty, carries everything I need or want, and also carries the Thule cargo carrier on top fully loaded."
"01  9, 2020",Transmission issues,"Transmission failed after 96,000 miles. New transmission installed and slipping after 16,000 miles with torque converter shuddering. Every mechanic i knew said get a Toyota, they're soooo reliable. Now idk what to get. This makes me so suspicious of every car I look at."
"11 19, 2019",More then I hoped for!,"Was looking for SUV/AWD/Navigation.  Got more then that!!!  Limited and Loaded 
Feels so awesome driving my new Toyota RAV4
Thank you Blaise Alexander Subaru of Williamsport"
"11  2, 2019",Good city car,City car for convenience. Reliable transportation. Not a highway car. Lacking the smooth ride due to light weight and under power. I should have bought the Highlander. The wife loves the ease of parking.
"10 21, 2019",I’m not sure,My car kinda shift gears or jerk can’t really explain it but it does that if I’m driving under 40mph. Not sure what’s wrong with it hope my transmission isn’t slipping. I have a friend who has the same exact one but hers 2 years newer mines a 2013 and hers does the same thing.
"09 14, 2019",First time I have ever Owned a Toyota,First time ever owning a Toyota SUV I really like the vehicle if you’re looking for an SUV Toyota RAV4 is really a nice ride
"08 19, 2019",Fun to drive!,"I wasn’t sold on this vehicle at first but after a few days I grew to love it! It’s super fun to drive & has most of the features I want in a vehicle. The front and back are super roomy...my bf who’s 6’ tall fits extremely well & comfortably in both the front & back of the vehicle. It has a great ride & gets good mpg. I would have given it 5 stars BUT this vehicle lacks a few very important features...ones I didn’t think to ask about because quite frankly I just assumed every vehicle had it these days. My bad! What it doesn’t have is air conditioning vents in the back of the suv! Say what!? I know...I was quite shocked to discover this as I was driving my kids around on a hot day...the vent in the dash...which the right half of is fake and doesn’t work...is supposed to cool off the back of the vehicle. Why oh why would anyone ever design a vehicle to not have a/c vents for the backseat passengers??? Another key feature it doesn’t have is remote start, however, some will have that...but don’t be like me & think it’s standard because it’s not & now I have to pay to have an after market remote start installed. Ugh. One last thing I don’t like & honestly thought no vehicle had anymore is a lever inside the vehicle on the floor alongside the drivers seat that you have to press to open the gas tank. Let’s just say the first time I stopped for gas was quite the experience. It took me a few to figure out how to open the door...sigh. But overall it’s a good vehicle."
"08 11, 2019",Boring but reliable,"Very very reliable, no issues at all. Engine is underpowered, but good all wheel drive system and roomy interior. Good value for the money if you don’t care about engine performance"
"07 23, 2019",Great Value RAV4,"This car was a good in all weather, reliable, and well put together.  It performed new as it did 7 years later.  Toyota quality is apparent."
"07 16, 2019",good family suv,"rides good, looks good, goes great in the snow.  small suv small but big with lots of room.   the dealship wait area is clean with lots of chairs, popcorn and ice cold bottle water.  a play area for the little ones.  all family members are welcome."
"05 20, 2019",Most reliable car I've ever owned.,Great all around vehicle. Very roomy and great gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4. They're just really well built and reliable. I love Rav 4's.
"05 13, 2019",WIFE'S NEW CAR,"WIFE LOVES THIS CAR! SHE REPLACED HER LEXUS IS250 WHICH WAS A GREAT CAR. I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD MISS HER LEXUS, BUT LIKES THIS CAR BETTER - MORE VISIBILITY, SIMILAR POWER, MORE REAR SEAT LEGROOM."
"04 29, 2019","Reliable, Economical",Good visibility for the driver.  A little noisy.   Zero problems.   I have 45000 miles on it.  It would be better with fabrics that would be easier to clean.
"04 21, 2019",I had a 2008 rav4 bought it used,"Bought a used 2008 Toyota RAV4 in 2010 with 50000 miles on it drove to 160000 miles on it. It is by far the best and trouble free suv I have ever owned. Never did It leave me stranded on the road although I got stuck in a storm in buffalo and couldn’t see a thing , this suv drove me to the hotel with inches of snow. If it was any other suv I would have probably been stranded on the highway. Overall all the years of owning just did oil changes and routine Maintainance. Sometimes did oil changes after 7000 miles and car just ran forever. In deep snow the all wheel drive system is not the best but I used snow tires and never really had a problem. Way to go rav4 it’s the best car."
"04  9, 2019",The most reliable vehicle I've ever owned! LOVE!!,"Friends & family love this car! Drives like  8 cylinder, luxurious ride,  and plenty of room for passengers, luggage, etc.  I love driving this gem!"
"03 29, 2019",Recommend or Not Recommend,"So far so Good. This car has room for my legs and plenty of power for a 4 cyl.
It drives nice and has a smooth comfort ride to it."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota Dependability 5 stars,"Purchased a used 2013 awd Rv4 limited with 43K,now has 55K,not 1 issue,AWD great for our winters in Buffalo,peppy enuf,decent gas mileage,handles well,comfortable ride for a small suv,has all the amenities,2 minor Quips,the info screen is useless in sunlight,cant see the info at all,and,for a top of the line limited the door lock switches,window switches etc are not lit at night,come on toyota talk about cheaping out,all in all a great vehicle."

Very reliable  and stable on the road

Huge amount of flexible space 

My second RAV- drove the prior one for 9 years and over 90000 miles"
"02 16, 2019",Toyota Blizxard Pearl paint chips!  Buyer BEWARE,"I love my car.  However the paint is peeling like crazy. Toyota knows of the issue and refuses to do anything about it. Research the paint before you buy. I cannot even have my car detailed without losing huge chunks of paint! Blizzard Pearl Paint cannot even stick to the primer, the entire car has to be stripped, sanded, and painted with different everything.  #Toyotapaintpeels"
"01 31, 2019",Nice car,Very nice car.  It is very comfortable.  I am impressed with the ride quality.  The heater worked wonderfully.  Visibility is fantastic.  I am happy with the safety rating of the car as well.
"01 24, 2019",Good car for the money,My only complaint is too much road noise.  Good mileage. Great handling in any weather conditions.  Wonderful dealership.  Have had no problems other than  only needed a new battery after 5 years
"12  1, 2018","I liked the RAV4 so much, I bought it.","I drove a hr to test drive a Toyota RAV4. I liked it so much, I ended up buying it. It was definitely worth it."
"11 22, 2018",very reliable,"My second Rav4. Very reliable, economical, tons of room in the back. Peppy, reasonably quiet, shifts like a dream and will tow my 15' A-liner trailer!"
"11 20, 2018",Most reliable car ever .,"This car is comfortable and friendly for owner.Is very fast , light and nice .to driver.I can recommend these car for all futures  buyers.
I love him."
"11 17, 2018",Great all around car!,"This car is great for so many different situations that you need it for. It holds 5 people, cabin is very roomy(more than my old midsize suv), gets good fuel economy, and is reliable. The base sound system is amazing considering it isn?t upgraded or anything. It could have a little more power on the highway but otherwise performance is good and ride comfort is fine. It?s just a good average all around suv."
"11 13, 2018",Finally a Toyota Owner and I could not be happier!,"I had a small SUV for a few years that turned out to be a lemon and was on the hunt for a new or used small SUV. My family has long been a fan of Toyotas but I've never owned one. After lengthy research by myself and my husband we found a great price on a used RAV4 and went for a test drive. I was skeptical about having a 4 cylinder vehicle again after years of driving an Accord but I was super impressed with the way the RAV4 drove. I love the safety features (blind spot monitor, back up camera and side curtain airbags) and since I have the Limited package the leather and upgraded stereo made the car even more appealing. I've been averaging around 27mpg which is 6 better than my old car and really enjoy driving again. I have a 35 minute commute to work one way and this small SUV has been great. I'm anxious to see how it fares with an Ohio winter. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone looking to purchase a small SUV. It has a real transmission (unlike many other in its class) and the safety features are top notch."
"11  7, 2018",Good car,Nice vehicle. 4 cyl is surprisingly sprightly for a naturally aspirated engine. AWD in a small SUV was just what I needed. Should be reliable.
"10 28, 2018",Awesome Car,"Great vehicle, service records were available. Salesman Steve Groves was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. Great sales team & showroom. Service folks were nice as well."
"10 10, 2018",Very happy with the Toyota Rav4.,"Excellant warranty.   Covered tourque converter even though the veh.
was several months past the 5 yr warranty.   That was the only problem that I ever had with the veh.  Very dependable;  comfortable, and great gas milage.   Just bought a new 2018 Toyota Rav5 to replace this one."
"10  5, 2018",Reliable & versatile,"We have owned all Toyota models (except carolla).
They, over the years have proven to be extremely reliable, long lasting & have great resale value. 
After owning a 1995 RAV, 2013 Redesign appears to be larger than older models. Ride & seats are very comfortable."
"07 25, 2018",Amazing Car for a Reasonable Price,Wanted a reliable car that was perfect for all the seasons that Colorado has to offer and my Rav4 is a perfect fit. A sleek interior and bluetooth radio lets your drive in style.

"05 25, 2018",Best investment for me!,This car has been great for me though any kind of weather. The interior is super comfy and spacious. The exterior is very sharp to the eye! Most of all it?s rated super safe!
"05 11, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"We have always had great luck with Toyota vehicles: Camry and RAV 4.
Internet Auto Brokers wrote into the contract that we could have the car checked with our choice of mechanics and our trusted garage gave its blessing."
"05  3, 2018",Love my car,The car is amazing. I love how it drives . It?s comfortable and overall better on gas . I love how it feels like a car but is and suv
"04 28, 2018",My dream Car,"The Car is in excellent shape and no matter the rudeness of dealership, I'm  still in love the car. I am coming from driving a Honda CRV and wanted to try Toyota. Love the RAV4 better"
"03 30, 2018",Love it,"I've had it for almost 5 years now, and still really enjoy it. Over-all, most reliable car I've ever owned.  Other than a cracked front window from a stone chip, the only think I've done on this car is oil changes. Built so well!"
"03 23, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"This car is perfect for me.  I'm short and not all cars fit very well for short people.. But this rav4 is great.. Wonderful gas milage,  very comfortable,  and roomie my husband is tall and it works for him too..."
"03 16, 2018",Great affordable car i purchase,I fell inlove with this car. Its very comfortable and very economic. It drives so smooth and very spacious inside. It feels like brand new car.
"02 25, 2018",Mister,Sporty and roomy and has some spunk love the blue tooth feature. I like the backup camera and all the room in the back for storage.
"02 15, 2018",I love the reliabilty of toyota,"It's good looking and also excellent on gas. I love how it zipps around town, it's so easy to drive and park and I know it will last for years to come!"
"01 29, 2018",Like driving chocolate. Smooth and silky.,"I have been driving a Subaru for the last few years I loved it, but wanted a small SUV that sat a little higher and had less miles. I found my 2013 Toyota Rav4  on car gurus. I love it!. The exterior styling is sleek and inside, luxurious. The back up camera is so helpful, as is the Bluetooth. And who doesn't love a moon roof!!. I'm looking forward to many adventures in my new Toyota."
"01 13, 2018",Love my Rav!!,This SUV is great. I love the all wheel drive and my back seat bench seating. The back seat is adjustable for you to lay back which is awesome! Lots of trunk space. I've had my 2013 RAV4 limited for 5 years
"01  8, 2018","This is my 2nd RAV4, both bought new.",My title says it all... it's one of my best investment made. Best value for the money and reliability and quality.
"12 10, 2017",My favorite Car of ALL Time,"I love my Rav4. The car far exceeds my expectations and the mileage advertised by Toyota. On my recent trip to Atlantic City, I was able to get well over 35 mpg on straight highway driving. I have plenty of room in the trunk for my folding bike plus luggage. The seating is comfortable and the way they are designed, they hold you on sharp curves."
"12  1, 2017",Good car,"The car has met my needs, but I preferred my Mitsubishi Outlander for perks. It drives well, but I had to replace tires at under 30,000 miles and warranty had just expired because it was already over 3 years old."
"11 27, 2017",Love the exterior of our Rav 4,We love our Rav 4 lots of room like all the extras included in our purchase we have always owned a Toyota  along with our grown children who also own Toyotas.
"11 21, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"This is my second RAV4, you can't go wrong with them... Toyota makes a good product and although you're going to pay more upfront, in the long run you'll have saved as maintenance is minimal cause they're built to last. I spent next to nothing in my last one compared to some and I had it a little over 10 yrs. Great Mid size SUV, sporty and fun to drive, absolutely love mine."
"11 15, 2017",Crashed,"I was T boned directly into the drivers door/front tire from a CRV traveling over 55mph.  Every airbag deployed as I spun multiple times, ending up off the road down in a field.  I climbed out of the passengers side with only a limp.  I am thankful every safety feature of this Toyota protected me."
"11  4, 2017",$2 BILL,Fun driving spacious vehicle where I can carry bowling xxxxx and golf clubs without having to take one or the out of the car...
"10 22, 2017",The best car I have owned,"Toyota's are my favorite male of cars. My first was a Camry that went far beyond 200k miles. My favorite model years ago was my Avalon, again going over 200 k miles. My next car was Camry which at 200k mi was given to a young couple needing a car 2 years ago and it is still a smooth ride. I now own the BEST car I have ever owned, a Rav4. I bought a 2013 fully loaded car 1 1/2 yrs ago.  It is great on gas. It drives smoothly and the all wheel drive was exceptional last winter."
"10 22, 2017",Most comfortable and reliable car I've owned.,"This car makes hauling anything very easy. Very spacious, and comfortable to ride in. This car has been extremely reliable since the day I got it. I have a 45 minute commute to work every day and this car makes the time fly by with its AUX chord plug in option, and smooth riding experience."
"10 18, 2017",Most super performance car I owned,"This is my first car ever and never regretted my decision of buying it. Its very comfortable, good mileage, less maintenance issues and great for long drives. Never got a back pain even with ling drives and hill drives."
"09 26, 2017",RAV4 is an awesome ride!,All around great SUV. Superbly spacious & ride is smooth. Great on gas mileage as well. Love my RAV4.
"09 12, 2017",Best All Around Car!,"This vehicle is stylish, fun to drive, great gas mileage.  I've owned all kinds of cars, I never thought a Toyota would meet all my needs and then some.   I liked it so much I got one for our Daughter.  I absolutely love this car!"
"08 23, 2017",This is my first Toyota and I love it!!,I love the RAV4 and how it handles! There's nothing I don't like about it! I will always and forever buy Toyotas from now on!
"08 17, 2017",Is the best and most reliable vehicle ever,"These has met all my needs, its easy to transport my family,entertainment is enhanced,it is cormfotable in terms of seats,wheels are okay and more other features."
"08  7, 2017",Beautiful on the outside; could use more on the in,Looks great; drives well. Can't get past the fact the fact that this car does not have a bin for my sunglasses inside. Bought this after owning a 2006 Sienna XLE Limited and am disappointed that the 2013 RAV4 is not even half as luxurious as concerns inside storage space and smooth ride
"08  2, 2017","dependable, great for an SUV, just not what I want","I purchased this SUV w the thoughts of needing cargo space .... practicality, but my heart is in need of a convertible w some punch..... prev owned toyota convertible, the back up camera in my Rav & bluetooth are both great extras, sharp but seems this model is similar to several other SUVs produced @ this time, would like better if had unique look separating from others designs overall though drives well & is dependable.... Toyota does seem to offer more ""extras"" for the $ also"
"07 16, 2017",Extremely Reliable Care!,"The Toyota Rav4 is an exceptional car for my money. The 2.5L DOHC 4 Cyl Engine puts out a healthy 275hp and 172lb-ft of torque. Plenty of pep as well as great gas mileage. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! If you're looking a great crossover SUV, put this one on your list to test drive."
"07 10, 2017",Great Mid-Size Car,"Bought this car just before starting our family.  We really wanted something safe, reliable, and had a good amount of space without being too big.  This fit the bill, we love this Rav4!  It also does great in snow and off road which is a good plus for us."
"07  9, 2017",RAV4 super car,"WOW.... This is one gorgeous RAV.... Loaded with features and options, backed by Toyota, this is a must have. Not only is the color amazing, the ride is awesome, and the comfort is top notch"
"07  6, 2017",Reliable and Efficient Car,"I used to drive Sedan, and getting into SUV has given me a what I was looking for, specifically more space for my children which served as family car for short and long trips."
"06 29, 2017",Very good on gas and very comfortable.,Love the color of interior. Best comfort on our trips we have taken. 28-30 miles to gallon on trips. I would buy another one when needed.
"06 28, 2017",Great pickup for a 4 cylinder,"I bought this 2013 vehicle new, currently have 64k miles on it, and have enjoyed driving it. It has great pickup, which helps in quick passing in tight spots. It is comfy (of course I'm not a tall/big person). I've had to date no major service issues."
"06 11, 2017",Comfortable ride!,"I really liked my Toyota Rav4. It was a great size for someone who doesn't love large SUV's but wants some cargo space, or has a family. The car was very reliable, and drove awesome. I did feel like it had some slight issues in snow (after further research realized it was probably just my model) driving, and heavy rain. The weight distribution was slightly off, and the back end would slide slightly. Still loved the car, and would totally recommend!"
"06  5, 2017",Is my 2nd Toyota.  They do it right.,"When I test drove this previously owned SUV, I realized there have been many advances in features I have missed.  My Rav 4 is such a pleasure to drive."
"06  1, 2017",Cant recommend it,"I bought this RAV4 to replace my F150. I had F150s for over 20 yrs and they just got too big for my needs, enter the RAV. The car did everything I wanted except for the comfort of the seats, after 20 mins I would get pain in the back of my legs regardless of how I positioned the seat, I could vary it a bit but never eliminate the pain and discomfort. I put 25,000 miles a year on this car so I can speak with good authority on these below average seats. It doesn't present in the test drive but on longer drives its torture. The F-150s are all day long comfortable as is the Subaru Outback that replaced this RAV4. Toyota made a nice vehicle with the RAV that suits the needs of many consumers but failed in the driver/car interface in epic fashion. The Nissan Murano outclasses the RAV by light years in seat comfort.  BEWARE if you are shopping a RAV4 try a Nissan, Subaru... see how the seat feels and think long and hard before getting that RAV. Other than that it was very good in all other areas but lets face it, if you dread even short trips in your car it doesn't matter what else it does, it has to meet a minimum comfort level and the RAV 4 does not, not even close."
"05 16, 2017",Best vehicle purchase ever!,"I only wished I'd gotten remote open/close on the door of the storage area. Seats let down for more storage space and when I open my sunroof, I'm in a sports vehicle. The sound system is awesome. I'm not a soccer mom, just like the room and the idea of having space for everything when needed. This is such a cool vehicle to drive, some knee discomfort; and as we all know, Toyota is a mainstay of reliability! One thing, the driver's seat leg room, distance between the seat and the accelerator/brake is a little uncomfortable for me, I try adjusting the seat to different positions but to no avail, smh.  This is causing my right knee to ache, be uncomfortable."
"05  5, 2017",Just what I needed!,"The model I got is not as ""glitzy"" as some SUVs, however, that's really not what I was looking for in a vehicle. I need decent leg room for a tall husband, and the RAV4 provides plenty. Gas mileage is definitely a selling point, as is the reliability typically associated with Toyota. The outside looks impressive and sleek, but I do think that the inside could use a bit more refinement. Turning and overall ride were tight and smooth. It's perfect for carting the family!"
"03 30, 2017",You want one,"The newer rav4 is a great small SUV for everyday use with lots of space for the random times you need it. I love the laws.  I say best small suv, out there and plus it doesn't look like a bubble!"
"03 28, 2017",Toyota Rav 4,"I really really love this vehicle. I went from driving a Nissan Sentra 2003 to a 2013 Rav 4  so this is quite  the upgrade. So far I have no complaints with the car besides a leaking sunroof. I'm not really sure why that is (I haven't looked into yet) but I went for a touchless car wash and the entire front interior of my car got wet. In terms of driving performance, it's a very smooth and comfortable ride. You won't even know when you hit 120 km/h but it does get slightly noisy when you do. In terms of gas, it's not as great as I thought it would be even on eco mode, but it's still quite good. For an SUV it definitely drives like a regular Sports car and doesn't take up space when parking. Overall, I'd say it's one of those vehicles that make you find reasons to drive. :)"
"03 27, 2017",Bought a Rav4,"Great deal, good service from BigM Chevrolet in Radcliff, Ky. 
 Ask for sales rep Tiffany Frizzell."
"03 25, 2017",Great SUV!,"I just bought a 2013 Rav4 Limited a week ago, and I am LOVING it! It is so comfortable and surprisingly roomy. All the safety features are fantastic, I feel like my family is much more protected. It has so many options that make it fun to drive."
"03 22, 2017",I just bought it,"I just bought the car about a week ago. The rear window wiper needed to be replaced (20k miles). Other than that...everything great so far. Very good gas mileage, comfortable ride, lots of space, and drives well in snow"
"03 22, 2017",The newest car i ever owned,i LUV THIS CAR IT DRIVES SO NICE AND IS COMFY. Has alot of gadgets i never knew came on a car. It quite and drives like a dream
"03 21, 2017",Overall very reliable car,Great vehicle Great gas mileage and comfortable interior. It is very good in the winter weather. Dealership always excellent with service.
"03 17, 2017",The car I needed most,I never expect that this car is so big inside. Its a suv that i never expect im gonna get but its good on gas
"03 16, 2017",Dima was Amazing,"I had an amazing experience with Dima. He provided amazing customer service, i loved the service he provided !"
"03 11, 2017",best car ever!,"I love my Rav4, second one I have purchased! Always reliable, they are comfortable, economical and you can use it for almost anything! They are the best!"
"02 18, 2017",Rav Too...,Purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Rav4 Limited and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love this vehicle. Truth be told I sure see a huge difference between this and the 2003 Rav4 L that I previously had. Way bigger way more powerful way more room and tons quieter. Not sure why people complain about noise because mine is ultra quiet. For starters tires are very important. Mine came with noncheap Cooper CS3  all Season Touring tires that are so smooth and quiet and handle great. The design is sexy and upscale. I do agree with those that mention the door extensions and yes they do tend to collect dirt and snow. I really don't let that dampen my spirits. Overall I Really Love my Rav4 Limited. In Silver metallic it's really HOT....
"01 27, 2017",Not what I expected from Toyota,"2013 rav 4 Limited needed a tourque converter with 40,000 miles then a new transmission at 49,000 and still has no pick up. Overall worse purchase of my life! So disappointed and will no longer purchase any type of a Toyota"
"03 26, 2016",Great Reliable Car for the Money!,"We purchased a used 2013 Toyota Rav4 XLE roughly a month ago with about 40,000 miles, and while this vehicle has it's drawbacks in areas, most of them I can live with. My previous vehicle was a 99 Toyota Tacoma with manual transmission. In comparison the Rav4 drives and rides like a dream. I will say that it does have a stiff ride to it, which seems to be a common complaint, but I still find it to be a fairly comfortable overall. I'm mostly a city driver and don't think I would be doing much off-roading with this vehicle. Mostly just wanted something that would handle well in the winter. I love that the rear seats recline, which is a nice feature for passengers in the vehicle. The cars computer system is a little clunky, and the interface could be a little more user friendly. I had a few issues with keeping my phone connected via bluetooth, but a quick internet search and updating the cars firmware quickly resolved those issues. The usb plug and play feature for music is nice. Put your music on a jump drive and play it directly through the audio system. We actually put all our music on an old hard drive we had laying around and plugged it in through a usb cable, so I have my whole library in the car wherever we go. The voice command does not work terribly well and often misinterprets or cannot understand what you are saying to it. Not a huge deal as I find this to be a useless feature on most devices, such as my cell phone. It works well for dialing numbers and answering phone calls, which is all I really need it to do anyway. Navigation voice command is touch and go. Beware that this vehicle takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.The trade off is you only have to change it every 10,000 miles, so that will likely save you money overall as it's basically three oil changes in one. There is a noticeable difference between the Eco, Standard, and Sport mode (although very slight). I found that I actually get the same mileage in Standard mode that I do in Eco mode, but Eco has less power when you're driving and accelerating. I'm not terribly aggressive on the peddle though. Sport mode does eat up a little bit of the MPG, but the vehicle seems to be more responsive. 95% of the time I just leave it in standard mode. Gets about 29 MPG with mixed highway and city driving, which is the sticker MPG. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but I'm fairly certain I could get between 30-32 MPG. The gas tank is listed at almost 16 gal, but I've yet to get more than 13 into the tank when the vehicle gas warning light first comes on. It's possible that there are another 3 gallons of fuel in there, I guess you wouldn't know until you actually ran the vehicle out of fuel. I love the back up cam, which is a nice standard feature to have for those city parking situations. Overall I'm am happy with the Rav4 thus far. We bought it for more passenger room and Toyota's reliability. Time will tell. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy one."
"03 23, 2016",Great Compact Crossver,"We have owned four Jeeps and got tired of the high cost of maintenance. We bought it as a Toyota Certified vehicle, it is extraordinarily good. We've owned it for three months and taken it into the mountains in snow, across the desert, and on 2-4 day cross country interstate trips from the Mojave to the Rockies and back. It's a keeper. It has three modes eco, regular and sport, and a very intelligent AWD system. Handles well, very comfortable, and while it does not have the ground clearance of a Jeep, we are extremely pleased with our purchase."
"03 22, 2016",Not at all impressed,"We bought our 2013 Rav4 new 3 years ago. We currently have 58,000 miles on it. There are 5 parking lot dings on the doors due to extremely thin metal. The ride is very rough, even with new tires, it is noisy on the highway. The canister oil filter is a real pain to replace....had to buy a special wrench from Toyota(expensive) and is almost worn out after 6 oil changes. The backup lights are very weak and hardly provide enough light when backing up. I really dislike the touch screen to change radio stations or other activities. In daylight you cannot see the screen. The Rav is missing numerous convenience storage spaces. Poor design overall, a elementary student could have given Toyota engineers better advise. Will be buying a CRV in near future...Very disappointed."
"06 29, 2015",Road noise and Yokahama tires,"I ha d 31 X 10.50 tires on my 94 pick-up that were quieter than the Yokohamas that came on my 2013 RAV4 XLE. These tires are the noisiest I ever owned with the exception of a set of Generals. When I hit even slightly rough road these tire are so loud I can't even hear the radio. Get a set a set of Michelin's as fast as you can.
The only other problem is that the large side panels are easily marred in parking lots. The vehicle needs side bumpers so that it doesn't look beat up in a very few years.
I fixed the glare on the interior backup screen by cutting a stiff piece of thin foam board around the top and sides. It isn't pretty but serves it's purpose.
All else considered I get great mileage 32.3 and putting it in sport mode to merge on the interstate is a thrill for the day. A very good vehicle that I would recommend, I'm still a Toyota fan just wish it came with quieter tires."
"05  6, 2015",Love. This. Vehicle!,"I just purchased my new (used) Rav 4 and I love it! It corners like it's glued to the road. The drive is so comfortable and even my 6' 2"" husband can sit very comfortably in the back seat! It's a dream."
"02 11, 2015",Enjoying the RAV4 Limited,"I've been very impressed with the vehicle so far. I came from an Acura RDX, which cost considerably more, but didn't offer any more features than the RAV4 Limited - and guzzled premium gas at 20 mpg. Although the Acura was more powerful, the RAV has plenty of pickup for all daily and highway driving. Pop it into Sport mode, and you get even quicker acceleration; or maximize your mileage in Eco mode - I average 25 mpg (about 60% city). I tested this SUV against the Mazda CX-5: although the Mazda may have been slightly sportier to drive (but not much), it fell way short of the RAV4 inside. The RAV is much more comfortable, roomy, and has all the luxury features (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) that the RDX had. I love the two-tone Terra Cotta interior. On the road, the ride is a nice balance between firm and shock-absorbing; it's not a Lexus, but it's quiet enough to make hands-free calls or listen to music (without blasting), and it handles all bumps smoothly. The sound system is quite good, and the navigation is adequate, though it has trouble finding points of interest. At 23,000 miles, I've had only two very minor issues: the rear hatch auto-opening mechanism (which I LOVE) had to be replaced (under warranty) when it failed, and the dashboard has started to rattle/squeak just a little, but only when the weather is below freezing. Unless the car falls apart, I expect to be happy with the RAV for years to come."
"01  9, 2015",Not much to brag about here,"There's not much I can say about the Toyota Rav4 LE except that it's a Toyota... which might mean a lot down the road. But for now, I'm not impressed. In fact, the 2013 Rav4 LE is really more irritating to me than anything else. There are features (or a lack of features) that are downright mystifying. When in park, the car rolls forwards or backwards for a greater distance than any other car I've owned. I haven't a clue why, except be careful that there's nobody behind you or in front of you when you put it in park. Otherwise, their toes might get squished. The plastic panels along the bottom of the front doors allow for all kinds of debris, dirt, snow and grime to enter the car's lower door interior. Again, why? What on earth were the engineers thinking when they added this lower door extension with a plastic shroud? The ""spoiler"" in the back just prevents your car from getting cleaned when in a car wash. Speaking of car washes, if you don't have a roof rack, watch out; the roof rack channel trim has a tendency to ""pop"" lose when going through the car wash's blow dryer. It happened to me twice.Toyota has no recommended solution for this.
I have a black interior. Which makes it extremely difficult to see the door handles and window and door lock buttons in the dark. Buttons are not backlit for the most part when the headlights are on. The auto window feature for the driver's side works when putting the window down -- but why not a one-touch feature for putting the window back up? What's the point of that? Very deceiving are the windshield wipers. On the turn signal, Toyota shows ""INT"" for intermittent wipers. In reality, there's nothing intermittent about the wipers at all. They turn on for slow speed or fast speed. Or not at all. That's it. They are not variable timing wiper blades. What car made today does not have this as a standard feature? This is 20 year old technology. I guess the answer is Toyota. Unbelievable. How cheap can you be? Although the interior looks refined, it's cheap and is prone to scratches and I suspect poor longevity. I had a stain on the silver rim of the air vent. When I went to wip the stain off with my licked finger... the silver paint came off!! Either I have the most caustic saliva known to man or Toyota is using the cheapest silver spray paint in the world. I'm going with the latter. The muffler or tailpipe rattles in idle making it sound like you have an exhaust leak. The brakes squeak when going in reverse. Cheap rotors? The engine is noisy. The undercarriage sound proofing is deafening... deafeningly loud. The heater / AC fan barely blows out anything in positions one and two. The doors feel lightweight and cheap. The salesman said ""Hey, you gotta shave back on something in order to get better mileage."" The transmission is an oxymoron. Why would you need a six speed auto transmission for a 4 cylinder car? How much gas savings can that really bring? As a six speed transmission, it always feels like the car doesn't know what gear to be in. As a driver, I feel like the transmission might go at any minute becauseof the way the transmission behaves. Very perplexing -- and as I said previously, irritating. I could go on and on about the irritating features this car has but I'm winded from complaining. If ten years from now I enjoy a trouble-free experience with this car, I'll overlook its idiosyncrasies, but until then I'm forced to live with these ""irritating"" features."
"10 29, 2014",Lacks basic features,"Toyota has gone cheap on this SUV.
We have the SLE with Nav package. It is very hard to see on a bright day and very limited in information provided.
Back-up camera is next to useless and gets blurred if it is raining.
We spend 5 months a year in the US and our Canadian model has no way to switch from Kilometres to miles also the GPS does not give a speed read out.
There is no DC power outlet for a cooler in the back seat.
We went from a 10 year old SUV to this and don't find it has as many features."
"10 23, 2014",2013 Rav4,"I'm enjoying this car. I've had RAV 4 in the past and I'm having a great time in this one. Added features off the power moonroof, fog lights,led screen miles analysis, control heating and the added 4 wheel drive feature is great. Now I have all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive in the same vehicle. The backup camera is great. The Sport mode and Eco mode also gives 2 options of control. I'm happy finally to get back into a SUV."
"10  3, 2014",Went from a Mustang to the Rav4 and LOVING it!!,"I bought my Rav4 brand new in the end of year sales December 27th and got a great deal on the price. I get 27.3 miles per gallon and I am at times very heavy on the gas. I have put just over 16,000 miles as this is a work vehicle for me and it still runs like the first day!! When I am on the road whether its highway or city the noise is very quiet compared to having a mustang before this!! The inside plastic is a little easy to scratch and I don't like having cloth on the door where you will be touching a lot but its a car not a house. I love the back up camera, cruise control and bluetooth! Three things that don't come standard on all vehicles in its category. This car also does great in very heavy rain where roads are flooded! I wouldn't have even know I was driving on a flooded road if the water wasn't spraying everywhere!! It did GREAT!! I do wish that the windshield wipers had more than slow, fast and faster but its just a pet peeve of mine and I can get over it. Tons of legroom in the back! Love that the back seats recline too! All around this vehicle is great!!"
"09  7, 2014",Wish I had not bought it...,"I waited 7 years for a new vehicle and had my heart set on the Rav-4 or the Honda CRV. We went with the 2013 Rav-4, I loved the look of it. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought it. At the test drive, I noticed all of the hard plastic inside, but did not realize how cheap it made the interior. Within 4 weeks we had an issue with the driver's door. We were told the ""welds"" had all come loose and a new door was ordered from Canada. Then parts of the roof rack came off, we went back to the dealer and had that replaced. A month or so later, the same parts came off the roof rack again! We never used the roof rack. My vehicle was white, my 4th white vehicle, under every door handle, under the gas tank door and under the two mirrors, each time it rained, black drip marks went down the entire vehicle at each of these places. Needless to say, at 4200 miles, I was done. I traded the vehicle in. We have a 2000 Toyota Sienna and the quality of that vehicle is so much better than the 2013 Rav-4. The vehicle I had seemed to be cheaply made, and it was not a cheap vehicle. This was our 4th Toyota, it will probably be our last."
"07 20, 2014",2013 Toyota RAV4 XLE,"Might be a little soon for this, but since the car is a 2013 model and it's July 2014 it's probably a good time since I'm now the second owner of this car. I purchased the TRav over the 4th of July just before my vacation to the ocean. After a 3 hour drive there, local Ocean City driving, and 3 hours back, I'm puzzled as to why the previous owner didn't keep the vehicle. Fun to drive; carried hubby and three teens around for a week or so and no complaints. Hubby has mostly all positive things to say also. Plenty of rear seat leg room and storage in the rear, and boy did we have it loaded down. Tks Toyota for the large side mirrors. Whoever thought of their size considered people like us that have the rear stuffed to the roof and no rear view mirror visibility. I was able to compensate just fine, and plan to purchase a roof rack. Believe me this isn't a knock to the TRav, but just an idea of what we packed. ENGINE: Performance for a 4-banger is excellent. There's enough engine and transmission options (ECO boost, Sport, and the neat Standard/Auto shifting) to make me feel that I've got enough options for all driving situations, and believe me I've used them so far. It's got some serious pep and delivers quickly. Gas mileage appears to be as advertised, but I'll probably be able to extend that carpooling back and forth from work since it's mostly highway. Soooo much better than my previous vehicle. TECHNOLOGY: Ok, this will be short from me since that wasn't much of a concern during purchase (Yeah, I'm in my early 50s - it shows). Love the back up camera, awesome bluetooth, excellent audio system, and hookups for iPODs, teenager gizmos, etc. Did I mention I love the bluetooth. Never thought I'd hear myself say that. ISSUES: Lack of lumbar support for cloth seats - Hubby has back issues so he's sensitive about this. See light color under scratches in red paint, but I plan to touch up and I'm very good at that sort of thing, so don't expect it to be a big problem. 4 stars for value for the money and reliability since that would depend on how trouble free the Rav will be in the future. Given the history of the Rav I'm hoping it will warrant 5 stars in a couple of years :) Additional PLUSES: Love how Toyota has the bottom of the body covered with the plastic and integrated into the bumpers. Figure I'll need that additional protection if we have another winter full of Polar Vortexes. Thought the dash design (bump out area to the glove box) was a bit odd at first, but after traveling around I've warmed up to it because it makes fiddling with the buttons easier. Lot's of additional hidden storage for tools and space around the spare tire for additional things. I'm a chick that likes her tools. All in all, I'm very happy with this vehicle and would recommend to a friend. Almost seems as though it was made just for me :)"
"06 24, 2014",Average vehicle,"We had a 2007 highlander, great car was a hybrid and got 28mpg consistently. The 2013 Rav 4 has great looks but it stops there. It's noisy, clunky ride and worst of all overstated mileage by toyota. We have coasted, drove flat roads, been very light on the gas and the best we get is 24.1 on highway and 22.4 in town in easy suburban driving. Had 4 toyotas, 2 highlanders, camray and this is the most disappointing mileage. Would not recommend."
"05  9, 2014",Average at best,"I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is ""average"". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average. Not a bad car, but easily outclassed by several competitors in its class."
"05  3, 2014",2013 Rav4,"Had an awesome experience purchasing my very first brand new car. I worked with Umesh, who helped me find the car I wanted withing my budget."
"05  1, 2014",I love it more every day!,"I've owned by RAV4 LE for 6 months. We had lots of snow this winter. The RAV always made me feel comfortable that I had good control of the vehicle. The windshield wipers and defrost work well. The gas mileage as calculated by the onboard computer says I've averaged 27.2 miles per gallon over the first 5400 miles. My manual calculation has it at 25.1mpg. I drive around with it in eco mode most of the time. When I'm in a passing or merging situation I reach over and press the sport mode button. The transmission will immediately drop 1 to 2 gears depending on my timing with the gas pedal. I love that button. The paddle shifting option doesn't work as fast. I'm 54, my 22 year old son agrees that the sport button works best when you are mostly operating in eco mode. The low load floor with no lip and lift gate rear make loading and unloading super easy. I'm not a super tech geek, so not having the GPS or blind spot sensors, found on the more expensive models, doesn't cause me any regret. I do like the back up camera. The side mirrors are large and well placed for backing up. My first car was a 1967 Dodge Coronet with shoulders that the RAV4 also tastefully incorporates. Great visibility, very strong cornering ability (this is not a sports car), good options for controlling the acceleration vs mpg, plenty of useful space, all come together to keep me smiling. The one area that I wish it were just a bit better is the left foot rest for the driver. That is a bit small and angled wrong for me."
"04 30, 2014",2013 Rav 4 Ltd.,"Outstanding vehicle in every respect. We would highly recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, economical and fun car."
"04 19, 2014",What a neat car,"WE bought our 2013 Rav4 Limited in November 2013. We were originally there to replace our tires on our 2010 Corolla and something catches our eye in the dealership. The Rav4 had the most compelling exterior design from the chrome in the headlamps to the ""rest-your arm"" on the rear-tail light. It was quite a change from the previous generation and it has grown on us. We decided to test drive a gray colored one. The ride wasn't too bad (but we own a rough-riding sports car so we are used to some bumps) but Toyota probably made it a little firm for handling purposes. The road noise was pretty minimal and when you opened the sunroof at 50+ mph, it was a little noisy. What REALLY made up our minds to buy the car were the immense amounts of technological features that it came with. Push button start with easy door-unlocking/locking, auto-dimming rearview mirror (this is great for that annoying headlight glare during the night), the great navigation unit, the blind spot monitor system with back up assist (although we wished the blind spot monitor made a noise when you tried to change lanes into another car), the vast amount of rear cargo space, the heated seats, the high driving position, and the bluetooth connectivity. I know that was a long list, but it was totally worth mentioning because it makes this car 100 times better than base models. The only problem we had since we bought the car was the power lift gate. Here in Florida we have lots of rainstorms. Water managed to get into the power lift mechanism in the gate and caused it to have a terrible squeak aw it went up. Fortunately toyota replaced it for free and it hasn't squeaked since. I use the car daily and gas mileage could be a little better. I know its rated around 26/31 but i feel like I've been getting a little worse, maybe 22/27. The transmission can be pretty smooth but if you been in a rodeo, the chassy seems to heave and ho upon acceleration. Its not the smoothest but its do-able. Rear leg room and head roof is plenty (I'm 6'0 and i fit perfectly fine behind my driving position. The two-toned leatherette seats are comfy but seem to wrinkle a little because the seat bolsters are in the way when getting in the car, so you are rubbing against it all the time. The eco mode has terrible acceleration but that's to save gas; the sport mode is peppy and good for fast-er accelerations and overtaking on highways, however, this accounts for poor gas mileage. I use normal mode for city driving. Overall, the Rav4 is a great deal with all the features it has. A bang for your buck. I would recommend it for families that want to take a nice cross-country road trip or those who use it to commute to work. Toyota truly lives up to their slogan with this car ""Let's go places""."
"04  1, 2014",Thankfully I don't do a lot of driving...,"I drove a 2009 Rav4 LE for almost 5 years and absolutely loved it. Now that I have the new 2013 Rav4 LE, I find myself wishing at times that I still had my old one...

I was given a brand new, 15 miles on the odometer, 2013 Rav4 from the dealership just over 2 months ago. I definitely like the interior more than the 2009 version with the back up camera, touch screen display, bluetooth, etc., but I also miss a couple of the old features too. I feel like there's less storageup front and the extrerior tends to scratch very easily. A lot of plastic additions and kind of silly to see fake plastic parts where lights would go on a higher edition. I don't have a far commute to work, so my gas mileage has been pretty decent, but I've never felt 100% comfortable in the car. I didn't even get off the lot yet, before turning the car around to ask why the brakes were making noise -- I was told they had to be ""broken in"" because it was sitting on the lot for so long. Brought the car back 4 days later because the bluetooth wasn't working correctly. I was told by 2 different people (including a specialist) that they didn't know how to fix it and I needed to bring it in for service.

Fast forward 2 months and the car has less than 2,000 miles on it. Not only does the transmission and acceleration make me nervous -- down shifts very quickly and has ""jumped"" forward on a couple occassions when putting the car into reverse. The engine has also been making a ""squealing/whining"" noise since I first got it when driving below 45mph and has a difficult time driving up hill. I've had to put my foot almost to the floor for it to accelerate. I plan on bringing the car in for service in the next couple of weeks and make note of these problems.

My 2009 Rav NEVER had a problem in the 4+ years that I had it. No engine noise, comfortable, no leaks, etc. I loved that car...this new one, is not so impressive. I think Toyota is a great car, but I'll think twice about getting another Rav4 once my lease is up in 3 years."
"02 14, 2014","Oh Hello, Space Ship.","First of all, I traded in my base-model chevy coupe for my next car, so anything I purchased would far surpass it. However, the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited was the best vehicle I test drove.

Having automatic-everything for the first time worried me a bit. The more electronics in the car, the more expensive it is to fix. Since it's a lease, I'm not too concerned with this issue. I especially like that I get the opportunity to replace my key fabs twice a year if anything happens to them.

I love everything about this car, especially the Blind Spot Monitor. I didn't think I would notice the light signals in the mirrors, but the sales guy, Brian Dobbs, convinced me to get it. It proved its worth within the first week of purchasing the Rav4.

PROS: Two Power Seat Setting buttons for the driver side so both me and a second person can switch back and forth in the driver side seat with ease. Seat Warmers, All-Wheel Drive. I love how the inside lights turn on when I walk up to the car. I flipped out the first night I witnessed it. I can connect my phone via bluetooth and use the car speakers to make phone calls (super plus!). The sound quality of the phone conversation isn't bad either. It gets good mileage, almost the same as my old coupe.

CONS: I thought it was strange that there aren't rear vents for the back passengers. Since I don't drive people around on a frequent basis, I'm not sure how this affects their experience. I also think it's odd that the middle cup holders for the back passengers are inside the center arm rest. If three people sit in the back, the middle person has to hold their drink. Again, this doesn't affect my experience with the car."
"02 13, 2014",2013 rav4 diesel,"We are the proud owners of a new rav diesel and I am pleased to say that that it is a delight to drive our trip from the dealers to home on the freeway averaged 5.5L/100 km and is whisper quite .Cannot fault the fit and finish however some brands like Hyundai put more effort into upholstery detail .We are stepping out of a 2002 s60 volvo and we find the seats to almost as good as the volvo .
It represented a more practical car than a hybrid vehicle .
With the vehicle set on cruise control 100 km/ hour on country roads it was un stoppable having mountains of toque to negotiate steep inclines.."
"02 10, 2014",Enjoying my Rav4 xle,"I have had my Rav4 XLE almost 3 weeks. LOVE IT, fun to drive. I had a Ford Edge and the gas milage was killing me. So happy Toyota changed the style of the exterior."
"02  1, 2014",one of the best car's I have ever owned,"This car is just the right size. Performs very well. I get great gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25 miles per gallon. It handles great in the snow. That is the number one reason I bought the Rav 4. I wanted all wheel drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. from the great sounding radio to the blind spot monitor, the backup screen, and the nav system and of course the Bluetooth for my phone and music. I really like the apps, such as Pandora.

Overall, this is one of the best cars I have ever owned and would recommend it. Toyota's service is second to none and that is extremely important in owning this vehicle."
"01 28, 2014",Hold On,"I have owned my Rav4 for six months and have owned many different cars and trucks in almost
50 years of driving . This is by far the vehicle with
the worst ride I have ever owned."
"01 21, 2014",Great Car,"I love my 2013 rav4 xle. Bought for my wife and wished it was for me. Great mileage and great exterior body. The only negatives is no leather or heated seats. camera works good when it doesn't snow or rain. Love the touchscreen on the dash. very impressed, i'm a honda person and glad i didn't buy crv. I live in Virginia and drive to Kansas and myrtle beach once a year. Drive for fun to D.C., Richmond alot. Love the white paint."
"01  1, 2014",Good car but Toyota cutting corners from earlier m,"I traded in my 2010 Rav4 for the 2013 model so I feel I can make a valid comparison. My 2010 LTD was a V6 so I knew going in that I was giving up excellent acceleration for a s0-so 4 cyl. But when considered against the new features of the 2013 I decided to trade it in. I got tired of the large swing door and lack of technology as found in the newer models. But here's where they cut some corners:
1. The spare tire is now inside (nice) but is no longer a full size tire and wheel but a temp.
2. The 2010 had real leather seats, now they employ something called ""soft-tek"" leather substitute.
3. The center console no longer two levels, just one large box.
4. On the 2010 there was a secondary glove box that had a push button release. Replaced by an open bin.
5. The interior and dashboard use more cheap looking plastic and no one will be fooled into thinking the carbon fiber surface is real.
6. One less 12V outlet and no 110V a/c outlet.

Even with all of the above, I don't regret buying this car. It's a good reliable vehicle with some nice technology. The price is lowest in it's class and the mileage is great. I get 28 mpg overall and it uses regular gas. However, if they brought back the V6 I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"12 22, 2013",You can't Make This Up,"Stranded at the dealership with a Uhaul in tow I asked the Sales guy to take me on a test drive with something comparable to my luxury vehicle which just decided to ""break up with me"". He suggested a Toyota Rav 4 Limited and I laughed saying I don't think so. I wanted comfort, a smooth ride, leather heated seats, auto seat adjustment with memory, navigation, performance with some get up and go. And decent gas mileage. No way was I expecting this in the Rav4 but I was wrong. Words that do not normally come out of my mouth. The Rav4 Limited is Awesome! Great ride, super cool looking, the performance is far beyond what I expected. Hugs the corners, has some power for a 4 Cylinder when in the Sport Mode. Surprising sound system, navigation and voice commend system is very nice and easy to use. Got a lot in this vehicle without the high ticket price of it's well known luxury model that I use to drive. Surprise, surprise. I love my Toyota Rav4 Limited."
"12 18, 2013",Honest Review 2013 RAV4 XLE AWD,"Let me start by saying that this may in fact be the right car for some but I will tell you about my experience with my current RAV4.
We found the Rav4 attractive for numerous reasons. We liked the overall styling of the exterior, though more black plastic than I liked but this seems to be a way for car manufactures to make some extra savings. I worried about it fading over time, which it will. I wasn't a fan of the rear end and I still do not care for it. this wasn't a deal breaker for me because what the exterior lacked the interior made up for it.
You get a lot of standard features on the XLE and that is why we chose it. Automatic Dual climate controls, roof rails, touch scree, back up cam, neat two tone color fabric, and so on.
We compared this to the escape (to small) and the CRV (noisy over the road).
PROs: smooth power train and enough power for the whole family. Me +3. roomy seating for all unless you squeeze 3 in the back. It's REALLY tight with three! Great cargo room even with the stroller. Road noise is minimal for this class compared to the competition. Nice interior and decent exterior.
This is why I'm rating this car so low and I have lost a lot of respect for Toyota quality.
CONS: The fake carbon fiber scratches extremely easy but the Toyota dealership replaced the scratched piece. Pretty nice of them. The ride is absolutely terrible! We did our initial test drive over some pretty smooth roads but once we got to driving it (after purchase) on other less improved surfaces, the ride was very noticeable. I'm pretty sure it's the rear suspension as it crashes over the smallest imperfections. The hood shakes and rattles all the time no matter the speed. There is a ""whine"" noise coming from the transmission when slowing down from 45+ mph. I also have some oil residue developing around the valve cover gasket. Toyota cannot find a leak. The transmission has a hard time on hills. Cruising at 70 mpg and climbing up a grade will case the transmission to downshift very hard once it finally engages. So hard that it woke my sleeping passengers and them asking if we hit something. All of these issues were brought to the dealerships attention and Toyota corporate. After several weeks and the car staying at the dealer for over two weeks, Toyota was unable to identify any problems. They took note of it and agreed with my complaints but say that these are characteristics of this vehicle. TOn top of all this, the bolts to the back hinge struts for the gate are developing rust and it is creating a rust streak down the column. Got to take it back to the dealer for this... yay, yet again.
After all of this I am pursuing the arbitration process and will try to get my money back. I cannot recommend this vehicle to anyone until they address these common issues with this model. Do a quick search or look on the forums and you will find I'm not the only with theses exact same problems.
I hate to say this, because I'm a Toyota fan, but do not buy this vehicle. If you choose to take anyways, PLEASE look for the problems I'm having as many others are experiencing the same. It's not worth it.... even for a Toyota."
"12  7, 2013",Car buying experience on a reliable car,The Toyota scion dealership in Apex NC made my car buying experience really smooth and fast. There was no pressure nor any hidden fees. I am very satisfied with overall experience. I will definitely recommend this place for new car buyers to try it out.
"11 28, 2013",Disappointed new RAV 4 owner,"I purchased a 2013 RAV 4 XLE with great expectations. What attracted me to this car was the exterior styling, well laid out and functional interior, back up camera, six speed automatic transmission, fairly peppy speed especially from the starting position, and good value for the price.

My disappointment has been the rear suspension ""slamming"" when driving over even modest speed bumps and breaks in the road, choppy transmission shifts especially in stop and go driving, loud muffler, and that incessant high pitched winding sound when accelerating that is so common to all Toyotas.

Of course when I asked the dealer to check out these aggravations, they predictably said it was ""normal"".

I previously owned a 2008 Honda CR-V and now wish I went with my gut and purchased a 2013 Honda CR-V.

I hope someone in authority from Toyota reads this review, takes it seriously, and start to make corrections to an otherwise very fine car."
"11 22, 2013","Nicest, and maybe last, car I've owned","RAV4 is roomy, with lots of extras standard; wouldn't have asked for Bluetooth or sun roof, but nice to have. Gas mileage is what Toyota posted, Solid feel, handles fine, peppy enough especially with EcoMode turned off (which we only do to get on the freeway). We drive cars for 10 years & 200,000 miles; hope this car will go at least that long."
"11  9, 2013",great deal,yours to discover this professionals and unbelievable sales representatives and great deal. and great car.
"11  8, 2013",Everything I needed and more,"Rides like a dream, turns on a dime... OK maybe a sliver dollar but tight. Gas mileage was excellent and it handles well in city and Long road trips. Entune is easy to set up and the auto seat settings for each driver is sure handy.

There is one minor disappointment, a nit ... that I've experienced in this superb vehicle - no built in garage door opener/Home Link capability.. Yep!!! Limited package I bought had all upgrades plus the dealer is so confident I received an extra year of No Cost Maintenance. And have we got room to spare. Moved 2 cats and a parrot 1200 miles easily. Get one of your own."
"11  6, 2013",5th Toyota,"I believe that Toyota missed the boat when they designed the interior. I have a 2013 RAV 4 LE with cloth seats. Seats are uncomfortable. The front seat head rests are as hard as a 2X4. They light grey put cloth on the inside of the door panels where ones hand touches every time the door is opened. I can just imagine what it will look like the first time a greasy auto mechanic opens or closes the door. Every time I make a right turn, I change the radio station or go to Bluetooth. The buttons to control the radio are too close to the outside of the steering wheel."
"10 25, 2013",Toyota - What a Joke,"I purchased my 3rd RAV4 this year in June 2013. Driven over 5,000 miles and Toyota you've totally let me down.
Primary uses: Commuting to work, shuttling kids to activities, going on trips to camp, bike, hike and kayak.

Performance:
The ECO mode is a joke - for my driving (mix of country roads, city and hwy) I get better gas mileage in normal mode. One would think going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would get better gas mileage. NOT! Worse gas mileage than my 2010. You would think they would work to improve it not go the other way.
Responsiveness and performance is sluggish at best. When accelerating to get on the highway, constantly have the RPMs at 4 or 5 ? Never had this issue in my old RAV?s. I also drive my mother?s Subaru Forester which drives and handles extremely better than this RAV in ?normal? mode. If you put it in ECO mode it is even worse. Mode (Sport,Eco) Buttons are not convenient and are a safety hazard to switch to Sport mode for those times I have to accelerate fast to merge onto the highway.

Features:
? Satellite is flaky. In my last RAV it worked like a charm and we really enjoyed it, now it cuts in and out. Dealership told me ?that is just the way Satellite works?. Umm, driving the same routes no I don?t think your answer is correct.
? Bluetooth constantly reboots my phone and is unusable. Again the dealership said can?t be the RAV it?s the phone; tried 3 other phones and still does the same thing. Phone company checked phones (Motorola and LG) and said no issues.
? Like the automated hatch, have not had the problems others seem to mention with piston failure.
? Rearview camera is the bomb.

Exterior Styling:
? Good copy of Mazda and Hyundai and others. No originality. Have gone from leader of the pack to follower.
? Can't believe the paint has mildewed!

Interior Styling:
? TOTALLY miss the storage compartment that was taken away to house the spare tire. Must less functional storage capability. Used this feature a lot in my old RAV to store chairs, purchases, etc.
? Miss the additional plugs behind the console for the rear seat and in the rear of the vehicle.
? Some controls are easy to reach for my short arms, others are hidden or hard to reach.
? Overall feels downgraded.

Value for the Money:
Should have gone with Subaru or Mazda. Looking to trade it in for another vehicle."
"10 23, 2013",Toyota's-all,"I have had several Toyota cars and pickup and they have all been good.

I do wish you had kept the swing door, much easier to open for a women or make all of them with power tailgate"
"10 20, 2013",I'm lovin' it,"I like the feel of the size of RAV, the finish is outstanding , the navigation and the entertainment systems CONS:difficult to read the gauges especially outside temp (passengers like to know the temp as well )Heated seats do not have variable settings."
"10 14, 2013",2014 RAV4 - The Best Car ... so far,"I purchased a Rav4 in March 2013 - I love It! I previously owned a Nissan, and 2 Honda Civics; but so far this is the best. My only concern is I am not seeing the Metallic Green on the color chart;... is it that they are not making it any longer...?"
"10  7, 2013",2013 Toyota Rav4! Fun to drive!,"Hello, having driven a 2005 Nissan Maxima for nearly 9 years and 215K+ miles, it was time to move to a something different. I knew that I was tired of driving a sedan and wanted something with solid gas mileage, stylish, fun to drive yet sat higher up than I was use to. Enter the 2013 Rav4.

What a great little SUV. It's a head turner, believe it or not. Gets great gas mileage, has a smooth ride, is very fun to drive and has lots of room for all types of things. Sorry for the short review, but i highly recommend it."
"10  5, 2013",moving from a Camry to RAV4,"I am enjoying the RAV4, Only one problem and that it is cuts out occasionally so I will have to take it back to a dealer to have that item checked. Dealer Bountiful Toyota, was excellent in every way. Friendly, efficient and wanted to meet my needs in a car."
"09 25, 2013",Broke 6 days after purchase,"This is my third Toyota vehicle.
I had been a long believer of Toyota quality until now.
I had all my maintenance and services done at Toyota on my previous vehicles and have the stamp book to prove it.

It had been less than a week since I purchased my 2013 RAV4 and took it off the lot

I was unloading the trunk when the hatch fell on me.
The right arm holding the hatch came straight off the door and took some paint with it on the way down.

I know I am not the only 2013 RAV4 owner with this issue because there are several online forums that mention this.
I also know there is an updated version of the piston for the hatch available.

I have been in contact with the dealer and Toyota to get the car fixed.The dealer took the defective piston, compressed it, and put it right back onto the hatch.They didn't put the updated pistons on or even a new one.

Toyota also stated that they will not replace the defective piston unless they issue a recall. They said I will have to wait until it breaks again.

The 2013 RAV4 is a nice looking car, but Toyota customer service and quality have fallen a long way."
"09 24, 2013",Fun to Drive,"I was worried about the 4 cylinder, but this car has some spunk. I really enjoy driving it. It has a ""Sport"" button when you want to waste gas and an ""Eco"" button for when you want to save gas. Who could ask for more? Steering feels good, too. I think I made a good decision.

I haven't had it very long, so reliability is based on Toyota's pedigree."
"09 24, 2013",Not Powerful Enough,"The 4-cylinder engine in the new Rav4 is way too small. Why did Toyota do away with the 6? Highway driving is difficult as there's not nearly enough power. The new design also gives this vehicle a very cheap feel. I used to have a 2010 Rav4 with the V6, and this new one is about five steps down! Yes, you will get Toyota reliability, but that's about it. If you liked the wood panneled station wagons in the 80s, then you will love the new Rav4."
"09 23, 2013",This 2014 RAV 4 model is a Flop for Toyota,"My Toyota Sequoia was in the body shop for a minor accident and the rental car service provided me with a 2014 RAV 4 Base Model in black color. The Exterior design is flawless but when it came to the interior design, Toyota lost it big time. I drove this suv for a total of 200+ miles in a couple of days and here is my honest review on it. The front seats are very uncomfortable, hard and short and you want to get out of it after driving 30 minutes. Forget about taking the long interstate trips in this RAV 4. It is also very jumpy and I thought may be the tires are over inflated but I was wrong. The engine noise and road noise is loud and feels like you have a window open somewhere in the suv. Everything you touch inside the cabin feels hard plastic. The middle armrest between the front seats is a joke and Toyota should have done a better job in designing this armrest and more comfortable cushioned seats considering long trips that buyers might take in this suv. The standard rear view camera is a Big Plus. The Eco drive mode did save on the gas. The sports mode is fun to drive only if you do short driving. I was considering buying this 2014 RAV 4 but after my driving experience I say No Thank you ! So if you are interested in buying this 2014 RAV 4, my advice is to go and rent it and drive it around for a couple of days. If you think you still like it then its your choice but don't go to the dealership for a short test drive and then be stuck with it."
"09 22, 2013",Interesting new technology,I recently downgraded from a VW Routan minivan to RAV4. The car is very stylish and still roomy. The Pandora Box and Traffic apps are very interesting. The car is very comfortable and has good pickup. Very easy to park compared to a large minivan. I like the push start instead of a traditional key.
"09 19, 2013",jgolfski,"This vehicle is good looking, economical, and fuel efficient. the limited has the technology that vehicles costing $10,000 more have. One great car!!!"
"09 18, 2013",Rides too harsh!,"Toyota did a very good job on most of this vehicle. I leased a 13 xle and have had the it 6 months now. At first, the ride seemed firm but it starts to wear you out after a period of time. I do a lot of city driving and this vehicle lets you feel and hear everything on the road. It really takes away from an otherwise nice vehicle. The good side is city gas mileage...23-24 good...the exterior, everyone makes nice comments. I have had the vehicle in some nasty storms and it was a trooper. The engine is noisy but plenty of power. The transmission is top notch and the pseudo manual is really good and easy . No problems and that's what i expect from
Toyota, the harsh ride is just too much to take. Thank goodness, i found an excellent seat cushion for it. At the end of the lease, it's going back...too bad, it could have been great. Also, Toyota needs to fix the touch screen. It's easy to operate but in the sun, your on your own. You can't see a thing on it...."
"09 18, 2013",Better Size Engine/MPG than the other SUV's.,"I looked for over 6 months and primarily focused my interest on the Honda CRV because of it's size and style inside. Then when I came across the 2013 new RAV4, there were only two things that caught my eye: 2.5L engine and 30mpg gas. A bigger engine with better gas mileage? Cool! Took the test drive - there are 3 models and two wheelbase sizes 17 inch in the Base and XL model and 18 inch tires for the Limited. I test drove both - the 18 inch drove much smoother (the new car is stocked with Bridgestone tires). I like the drive, the features and room (especially the backseat) of the Limited. However, the engine is an electronic 6 speed that does make a ""wining"" noise when accelerating. The radio drowns it out. The car is fast, good acceleration, good gas mileage and nice interior (it's not real leather - it's a imitation leather, according to the dealership, because it is lighter and more humane than using real leather. Everything about the car is focused on ""lightness."" of all aspects - body, engine, transmission, etc., which all leads to better gas mileage for the bigger engine. Works for me!"
"09 16, 2013",Poor interior design,"Top glove box no door?
front console area only has one side, things fall onto floor,
no auto headlights, can't see display in sunlight,
we purchased an XLE, it came with a sun roof, but you can't get a power seat or leather or interior hatch release.
Mechanically it is Toyota, but the interior design and options are from another world. We tried a limited but that Softex is a poor substitute for leather."
"09 12, 2013",Bigger engine - better gas mileage than other SUVs,"I looked for 6 months for my first SUV; looked at Honda CRV....wanted style, gas mileage, bigger engine and a reasonable price for the model. I test drove the CRV but didn't like the handling or road noise. I had a Toyota Solara for over ten years so I knew about the Toyota quality. I looked at the New RAV 4 and what caught my eye was 1) size of interior ; 2) bigger engine than the CRV (2.5L vs 2.4) but it got better gas mileage! Rides like a car. With the Limited model you get 18-inch, vs 17 -inch tires on the base or XLE model. The engine is a 6 speed electronic that whines a bit. Eco option is a gas saver. Gets approx 24 mpg city. No road noise with the 18 inch tires. A little more with 17 inch. Great back seat space and good storage space in the back...LOVE IT!!"
"09 12, 2013",Short Life!!!!,"We have a 2006 RAV 4 and yes, we have 170,000 miles on it. But it should last for a lot longer. It uses a quart of oil every 600 miles and the transmission has just gone out. We have all the maintenance records with the dealership and drive very, very mildly. We have found blogs on other web sites having the same issues we have so if you want to get a vehicle to last 200,000+ miles, it's not the RAV 4!!!!"
"09  8, 2013",Beautiful SUV,Excellent value for the money. I love the 3 different driving modes and the gas mileage.and the roomy interior. I have the CR-v no comparison .
"09  8, 2013",Crashed,"Just got the RAV4 and had a horrific crash into a semi , whole front , and rt. door torn off . Most people would be dead in this type of crash . All 8 airbags saved them from injury. The RAV 4 saved my family , they walked away from a certain death ."
"09  4, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited,"Toyota hit a homerun with the 2013 RAV4. From the minute I test drove mine I was hooked. I love the comfort of the seats and having ""all"" the controls on the steering wheel cuts down on distractions. It's just a well thought out SUV. I love the NAV system it is very easy to use even for a fifty something guy like me. I bought it and the same day I drove it 300 miles across Texas."
"08 19, 2013",happy with purchase,I'm pleasantly surprised with the mpg I'm getting. I average 32.5 mpg (75% highway). I use the ECO mode only. No problems so far and I currently have 4000 miles. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable awd that drives like a car and gets really impressive gas milage.
"08 15, 2013",Poor Gas Mileage,"We purchased the 2013 two wheel drive Rav4 in July and have put about 2500 miles on it so far. We always drive it in Eco mode and have yet to get anywhere close to the stated mileage for the vehicle. Consistently it is getting 26 mpg (not 31 mpg as stated on the sticker) on the highway (driving 75mph with a/c on). We are careful to accelerate slowly in order to get the best gas mileage we can, but to no avail. In the city, we are getting 22 mpg. There again, we are not making rapid accelerations nor quick stops. My Toyota dealer just says, ""hu"" and has no answers. The only reason we sold our 4Runner, was to get a more efficient car and by going to the Rav4, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped."
"08 11, 2013",excellent fuel economy,"GREAT M.P.G ,after topping off the tank ,took a 105 mile road trip & got a whopping 42 miles per gallon with the eco switch on ......... yes 42 mpg ,with 4 people in the vehicle ...... 105 miles used 2.5 gallons of regular fuel . after topping it off again we used it around town somewhat city driving and retopped to find that we got 34 mpg city . so I did some investgating and found that Toyota wasn't able to check the fuel economy with the eco button on and hadn't any idea what difference it would make . lol THANKS TOYOTA !!"
"08  9, 2013",Best car I've owned yet!,"This car has the best safety ratings and feul economy for small SUVs. It also has great suspension, the car will glide over train tracks. It has comfortable seats and an awesome back up camera.

I received wonderful customer service from Toyota of Murfreesboro, especially Gus who sold me the car. All of the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car. I would refer anyone there.

Toyota offers a lifetime warrenty on 2013 vehicles, with 2 yr/2400mile maintenace package for free."
"07 27, 2013",Great Car!,"Traded in my Lexus ES for the Rav Limited. Wanted better mileage and more cargo room. Have had car for about 5 months. In ECO get 30 mpg in town, 29 this summer with AC. Have not tried the Sport mode yet.

I like the interior, think the seats are easier to maintain than leather. Interior design works just fine for me, easy controls, apps are great. The Blind Side Monitoring is fantastic, especially when backing out of a parking space. The back up camera screen is great. But I will say, I like the one in my husband's Toyota truck better as the camera screen is on the mirror.

The 2 year free maintenance is a plus as is Toyota reliability. Keyless door locks are so convienient .

One thing I would have liked is an adjustable passenger seat. Small thing I guess but Toyota should have added that, especially on the Limited.

I did test drive a KIA sedan and found it noisy, and cheap feeling. Have had the Lexus RX, IS, ES so that is all I really have to compare the Rav to and I find this car just fine. I like the road feel, being able to see better on all sides, mileage, interior, nice exterior style. Apps work great too, Bluetooth wonderful."
"07 22, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited AWD is OK with some issues,"We've driven nothing but Toyotas since 1968 (a Corona). For my needs, the ""Limited"" trim package was a good value and worth the cost. The RAV4 replaced a Camry XLE V6. The styling is fine (especially the power rear hatch) and interior room is good. The solid black interior is much nicer than the odd two-tone alernatives. Seat comfort in the driver's seat with the faux-leather is OK thanks to the lumbar support, but the lack of a power passenger seat seems cheap. The NAV system is easy to operate. Overall gas mileage has been better than the EPA estimate. The interior trim (mainly the center console) has too much hard/flimsy cheap-feeling pastic. The 2.5 engine performs well whether in eco or sport mode - I keep the vehicle in eco mode all the time. Overall, I view my new RAV4 as one of the better Toyotas I've owned."
"07  1, 2013",Rav 2013 review,"Just picked up our 2013 Rav Limited last week.
In our 2011 Rav there was a space to the right of the steering wheel where I could keep change.

No outlet in back seat for kids hand held games.

Nav screen to flat should pitch to drivers side.

No power seat on passenger seat.

No real spare tire."
"06 30, 2013",good small SUV,"Good design, good mileage, good price and fun to drive. I got a very good deal from Matia Toyota dealer in Sacramento, CA.
I have been shopping for some many Toyota dealer throughout Ca."
"06 26, 2013",Great Improvement,"Was considering an SUV but never paid much attention to the RAV4. When I saw the 2013 I loved the style and especially the new rear hatch. Some reviewers were concerned about performance, I can tell you there is a distinct difference driving in Sport Mode VS ECO Mode. This one is a true winner, Great Value. The XLE upgrade over the base model is well worth the small cost increase."
"06 15, 2013",New Rav4,"I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage with a 2013 year, I had a 2003 Nissan Altima and could expect at least 30 mpg on the highway. I'm 2 or 3 miles lower with a newer car, maybe it will get better, I hope"
"06  7, 2013",good car,"Great resale value, comfortable, easy to use, good fuel economy, and great sales person (kyle). I recommend this car highly!"
"06  6, 2013",Wonderful Experience at Toyota of Greensburg,"Bought a Rav 4 at Toyota of Greensburg and was treated wonderfully. Zach Guy my sales person and Brian the sales manager gave me a great deal on my trade and a great discount on the new vehicle. If you're thinking of buying a new Toyota stop in at Toyota of Greensburg, you won't be disappointed."
"06  1, 2013",RAV4,Gas milage seems to be very good. The standart back-up camera is extremely helpful when paralel parking. Seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room in the back seats. Ample cargo area. Surprisingly good pick-up when merging onto a highway. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
"05 26, 2013",lack of highway power,"took for a long test drive. city driving was ok, had enough power but when i took it on the highway and put it to the floor it was powerless. didnt have the power to jump over in the passing lane without getting run over. i was very dissapointed since i was ready to purchase. oh well, ill keep looking"
"05  6, 2013",Nice Ride,"Bought a 2013 RAV4 XLE. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip and averaged over 35 MPG traveling 65-70 MPH. It was a quiet, smooth ride. Very Happy with it. The only thing I would like is a more versatile center console that fits a cup with a handle, and maybe a more solid hood. Over rough roads the hood flexes some. It is a minor issue, just an aesthetics type thing. No regrets buying it so far."
"05  6, 2013",First new car for me,"I was looking to replace a 13 year old Toyota Camry. I originally looked at the prius, camry, honda civic, honda insight. I saw the new Rav4 and took it for a drive.

It was comfortable and loved the XLE trim upgrade for only $700. Well worth it.

The Econ mode lets me ge 38 MPG on the highway driving 55MPH on flat roads.

The SUV is extremely comfortable and hold all my gear and can carry my two kayaks on the roof racks.

I love the electronics. Ipod connects both bluetooth and through usb cable.

I love this car. Thinking about buying another one to replace my wifes Honda element."
"05  5, 2013",Best small suv,"The changes made to the 2013 are excellent. I would have bought a Honda CRV if Toyota had not changed the lift gate and spare tire. I waited four months for the RAV4 to get manufactured and delivered to local dealerships. It was worth the wait! I bought the Limited model and love the options that come on that model. I have had the vehicle three weeks and have been getting excellent gas milage. There is nothing that I don't like about the vehicle.

"05  2, 2013",Best Small SUV,"Traded a 2012 GMC Terrain for the 2013 Rav 4 XLE. Love everything about this vehicle. The mpg is excellent, fun to drive, very comfortable and amble cargo area. This is a great value ... you will not be disappointed."
"04 22, 2013",So far execellent,"Confusing instruments= seems to cover all I need to know,
Not used to the system !! Used to larger autos but seems to do all that I require and fun to drive. I'm happy with the TOY!!"
"04 11, 2013",Love this car,I had a ford escape before and decided to try Toyota. This Toyota Rav4 is Great. I could not ask for a better car. I heard that Toyota was a great company but Wow am I impressed. I love everything about it
"04 11, 2013",Top Notch Small SUV,"I'm one of those people that need to research everything to the nth degree before I purchase.
I researched and test drove many small SUV's.......

For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4.

I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle.
The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's.

Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"
"04  3, 2013",the best car I ever had,"We bought our first Toyota RAV 4in 2007.....For 5 years we had no problem at all..but we lost IT.in SANDY...and we had no doubts that we should buy again RAV 4,,model of 2013....The car that we had before our first RAV 4_ was Land Rover...and it was not that reliable like TOYOTA .RAV 4...."
"03 20, 2013",First SUV,"I started my purchasing process setting up with a buying service and using an insurance company's recommendations. I had no intention of purchasing a Toyota, in fact I was opposed to the idea. I'm still surprised I purchased one.

I had test driven the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-5, Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox, Lincoln MKX, Subaru Outback, and Forester.

I needed a car like ride, and room for several suitcases or crates in the back, I wanted AWD, leather heated seats and good MPG. Didn't think I'd get all that.

There are a lot of good choices, I do believe I could have been happy with several of these.
I bought an AWD Limited with no additional options.

the pluses of the RAV4:
* bluetooth, it works flawlessly. Didn't expect to have that standard
*Nice ride, quiet cabin.
* I'm averaging 27 mpg (1500 miles) though I drive aggressively. When driving in eco mode and being mindful of mpg, I can get 31 mpg.
*AWD was perfect for our recent snows. I drove it in 6"" of fresh unplowed snow. It's surefooted.
*keyless entry. . With gloves on in winter it's just so much easier.
*the 2 tone interior looks great.
*great ride, even in the back seats.
*Plenty of leg room for my tall family.

Negs:
*so so stereo. (3 others were far better) I did not get Nav. or the stereo upgrade My previous car had a better stereo. It's 8 yrs old too. A new stereo on their top tier style should sound better.

* The dealers all advertise the seats in the Rav4 Limited as leather. They are NOT. I'd decided on the Rav4 after driving the Honda. That dealer told me the Rav4 seating was a synthetic/leather blend. After researching the Softex I called the salesman on it, he then checked on it and it's synthetic. I felt deceived. I can't believe they don't know it's not leather. I went to 3 dealers and heard the same thing.
(I asked for and received an additional price cut by the dealer, for their mistake.) . I do like the feel of the Softex, and hope it lasts like leather."
"03 18, 2013",Great Car,Keep making Great cars and trucks for generations to come!!! Will have 3 kids needing cars in the next few years
"03  8, 2013",Third Rav4,"We leased a 2006, purchased a 2010 and just got the 2013. The 2006 had a 6 which could make your nose bleed when punching it at a light...whee. All were reliable with no issues. The only complaint(s) are we miss the dual lid on the console storage box, the sliding cover on the upper dash storage shelf and the sunglasses storage in the roof. The backup camera is awesome as is the Bluetooth sync for your phone. We got a little organizer for the console storage and are looking for some kind of box for the open dash shelf. With only 500 miles we are getting better mileage than the 2010."
"03  7, 2013",Happy so far,"Have owned only 3 weeks but am happy with my choice. Was also seriously considering a Honda CRV and looked at several other crossovers (every make has one and they all look about the same). Preferred the RAV4 XLE (FWD, cloth seats) exterior and interior design and the timing chain (vs. CRV's belt which requires major $ to replace at 80,000 miles). Also dealer provided lifetime powertrain warranty at no additional cost. Toyota made some nice improvements on the 2013 model vs. prior ones. Hopefull still one of the most reliable cars made."
"03  5, 2013",First New Vehicle Purchased,"My husband and I took the plunge and bought our first New Vehicle EVER after our beloved Jeep rolled over 200k miles and ceased to be as reliable as we wished. We did a ton of lot shopping and test driving before finally making a deal with the very professional staff at Rouen Toyota in Maumee, OH. Our salesman Byron was top notch and spent a lot of time showing me all of the features of my new Rav4. He was knowledgable, patient, and kind toward our children. I would recommend this dealership, Byron, and our new SUV to everyone. The Rav4 has the fuel economy we'd been lacking and the space we've grown accustomed to with our Jeep and Tundra Pickup. A good price and a zippy vehicle for my everyday commute."
"03  4, 2013",RAV 4 Limited,This car drives and handles much better then Honda CR-V EX-L. Can't go wrong for the price and reliability rating. if your are in compact SUV market consider this car.
"02 28, 2013",Looks like the rest performs like a dog,"A long time Toyota RAV owner and fan, this car was a huge disappointment. All the hype AROUND THE LATE REVEAL...LOOKS LIKE ALL THE REST IN ITS CLASS! Performance....felt like I could run faster and the ""engine sounds and performance says cheap""...not the sticker...very disappointed...will take a look at some others..suggest you do the same and compare before you buy!"
"02 27, 2013",lovin' my new car,"When looking for a new car I knew I wanted a small SUV. I looked at a few different makes and models from other dealerships. I absolutely fell in love with the 2013 Rav4. Just this year they came out with the new Rav4 without the tire on the back of it. It is just a beautiful car inside and out. It might be a small SUV but has a ton of room inside and the back seats even recline! The only thing that they could improve on is the back speakers. They are in the door and its hard to hear anything in the back, other than that, I love everything about it."
"02  9, 2013",Best Looking little SUV.,Reliable SUV. Just right. Smooth ride. Love the new hatch back door. Blessed to own one. Was waiting for Toyota to make pop up back door without the tire on the door. Got one right away.
"01 19, 2013",RAV4 - Much improvement!,"I disagree with the reviewer that removing the 3rd Row option from the RAV4 was a mistake. It was silly to offer such an option in a small SUV - not even a child could fit. I'm sure demand was very low so Toyota made a wise business decission.

I just purchased a 2013 yesterday and I love the new design. I had a 2010 4 Cylinder RAV4 before and have always been happy with the 4 Cylinder. I have driven a V6 in the past and did not see the need for a V6 in this car. I have plenty of power and in the new RAV4, I have Eco and Sport mode.

Hurry out and test drive one. I love my Display Audio and the Bluetooth setup in about 60 seconds."
"11  4, 2023",The RAV4 is the best running car I’ve ever had.,I love my 2013 RAV4. It runs great. I haven’t had any problems with it. The key is to always keep up the maintenance  Toyota makes the best cars.
"03  5, 2023",2013 Rav4,"Car is very reliable, i have had it almost 10 years. It has 155,000 mi
Have replaced the normal things like brakes and tires. It has a stiff ride, changed shocks and struts and still stiff. which is the #1 disappointment. Between 45 and 55 it has a bad vibration.."
"11 25, 2022",Terrible handling/ride,Worst ride ever. CD player had to be repaired. Battery needed to be installed. Dealership held back on providing problems. Probably my fault for not asking. Just relied on the  Toyota name. Headlights  were foggy and should have been improved .Defect in left front fender. Needed a wheel alignment. I could go on. I was the fool.
"09  9, 2022",I had to replace bulbs several times.,"2013 RAV4 I bought this small SUV with 25,000 miles. This car is Mexico/Canada build. I am gonna keep it short when this car passed the 105,000 miles started to fall apart( literally). The car is “affordable “ because it is built with cheap parts, and replacement are very expensive. I had to replace shock absorbers, many lights, and TRANSMISSION."
"04  5, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable,"Interior and exterior appearance are just perfect. It has plenty of power and provides a smooth ride in any weather condition.
We have owned this car for 4 years and will keep it for another 4 years at least."
"12 14, 2020",Glad to be back in a Toyota.,We had an older RAV4 and when looking for another vehicle knew we wanted to check out something newer.   Toyota has door a good job in updating the look and comfort without compromising the performance.   Happy to have given another RAV4 a home.
"09  4, 2020",The nicest comfortable vehicle so far,"this car meets all I  need in a vehicle, roomy, comfortable , allot of power, and not to complicated. great handling car , smooth ride. I would buy another."
"08 16, 2020",Reliable Small SUV,"We have 50,000 miles on this car.    So far no defects.    Fabric seats hard to clean.  We get 24 city and 28 highway mpg from the base 4 cylinder engine.   A bit noisy on long trips."
"05 30, 2020",Not a car for comfort or room,"This car is extremely uncomfortable, very stiff over bumps. It doesn't have a lot of room inside and nothing makes sense to me. It's just too bad because Toyota has always been one of my favorite vehicles. But they really did a horrible job on this one. I would never get a rav 4 again after that."
"05 24, 2020","Safe, durable reliable.","The Rav-4 is a great SUV for folks who have long winter commutes. The safety features just keep getting better and that truly matters. You can expect to put 300,00 miles on the speedometer with very few repairs."
"05 19, 2020",Beautiful car,"This car exceeds my expectations so far.  Rides beautifully, quiet, and smooth.  Definitely enjoy driving this vehicle.  Good gas mileage and a good solid, reliable car that comes highly recommended by my mechanic."
"05 18, 2020",Love the car,Haven't driven it long but so far I love it. It's comfortable and drives great. I like the compact look but still is roomy inside.
"04 22, 2020",Overall Great Car,"This was the first car I have purchased. A limited edition Toyota RAV4. It has leather seats, sunroof, and is a beautiful cherry red color. I love everything about this car but I wish the screen inside the car looked a little more updated. But can't be too picky considering it is a 2013. I am love with this car. Also drives very smoothly and has good pick me up. Would recommend this car to anyone."
"03 30, 2020",It is exactly the right car for me.,"This car is easy for me to get in and out of.  It suits my needs, is easy to park, and has been so reliable.  I've received many compliments on it since it was new, even from strangers in the grocery store parking lot."
"03 23, 2020",reliable and dependable car,"the suv meet the need of my daughter day to day commute from home to work and to do some run around.i will highly recommed this suv to any one that need a reliable car, economy and fuel efficient."
"03 22, 2020",Gray Phantom,"I thoroughly enjoy this car. It's comfortable, easy to drive, dependable, sporty, carries everything I need or want, and also carries the Thule cargo carrier on top fully loaded."
"01  9, 2020",Transmission issues,"Transmission failed after 96,000 miles. New transmission installed and slipping after 16,000 miles with torque converter shuddering. Every mechanic i knew said get a Toyota, they're soooo reliable. Now idk what to get. This makes me so suspicious of every car I look at."
"11 19, 2019",More then I hoped for!,"Was looking for SUV/AWD/Navigation.  Got more then that!!!  Limited and Loaded 
Feels so awesome driving my new Toyota RAV4
Thank you Blaise Alexander Subaru of Williamsport"
"11  2, 2019",Good city car,City car for convenience. Reliable transportation. Not a highway car. Lacking the smooth ride due to light weight and under power. I should have bought the Highlander. The wife loves the ease of parking.
"10 21, 2019",I’m not sure,My car kinda shift gears or jerk can’t really explain it but it does that if I’m driving under 40mph. Not sure what’s wrong with it hope my transmission isn’t slipping. I have a friend who has the same exact one but hers 2 years newer mines a 2013 and hers does the same thing.
"09 14, 2019",First time I have ever Owned a Toyota,First time ever owning a Toyota SUV I really like the vehicle if you’re looking for an SUV Toyota RAV4 is really a nice ride
"08 19, 2019",Fun to drive!,"I wasn’t sold on this vehicle at first but after a few days I grew to love it! It’s super fun to drive & has most of the features I want in a vehicle. The front and back are super roomy...my bf who’s 6’ tall fits extremely well & comfortably in both the front & back of the vehicle. It has a great ride & gets good mpg. I would have given it 5 stars BUT this vehicle lacks a few very important features...ones I didn’t think to ask about because quite frankly I just assumed every vehicle had it these days. My bad! What it doesn’t have is air conditioning vents in the back of the suv! Say what!? I know...I was quite shocked to discover this as I was driving my kids around on a hot day...the vent in the dash...which the right half of is fake and doesn’t work...is supposed to cool off the back of the vehicle. Why oh why would anyone ever design a vehicle to not have a/c vents for the backseat passengers??? Another key feature it doesn’t have is remote start, however, some will have that...but don’t be like me & think it’s standard because it’s not & now I have to pay to have an after market remote start installed. Ugh. One last thing I don’t like & honestly thought no vehicle had anymore is a lever inside the vehicle on the floor alongside the drivers seat that you have to press to open the gas tank. Let’s just say the first time I stopped for gas was quite the experience. It took me a few to figure out how to open the door...sigh. But overall it’s a good vehicle."
"08 11, 2019",Boring but reliable,"Very very reliable, no issues at all. Engine is underpowered, but good all wheel drive system and roomy interior. Good value for the money if you don’t care about engine performance"
"07 23, 2019",Great Value RAV4,"This car was a good in all weather, reliable, and well put together.  It performed new as it did 7 years later.  Toyota quality is apparent."
"07 16, 2019",good family suv,"rides good, looks good, goes great in the snow.  small suv small but big with lots of room.   the dealship wait area is clean with lots of chairs, popcorn and ice cold bottle water.  a play area for the little ones.  all family members are welcome."
"05 20, 2019",Most reliable car I've ever owned.,Great all around vehicle. Very roomy and great gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4. They're just really well built and reliable. I love Rav 4's.
"05 13, 2019",WIFE'S NEW CAR,"WIFE LOVES THIS CAR! SHE REPLACED HER LEXUS IS250 WHICH WAS A GREAT CAR. I WAS WORRIED THAT SHE WOULD MISS HER LEXUS, BUT LIKES THIS CAR BETTER - MORE VISIBILITY, SIMILAR POWER, MORE REAR SEAT LEGROOM."
"04 29, 2019","Reliable, Economical",Good visibility for the driver.  A little noisy.   Zero problems.   I have 45000 miles on it.  It would be better with fabrics that would be easier to clean.
"04 21, 2019",I had a 2008 rav4 bought it used,"Bought a used 2008 Toyota RAV4 in 2010 with 50000 miles on it drove to 160000 miles on it. It is by far the best and trouble free suv I have ever owned. Never did It leave me stranded on the road although I got stuck in a storm in buffalo and couldn’t see a thing , this suv drove me to the hotel with inches of snow. If it was any other suv I would have probably been stranded on the highway. Overall all the years of owning just did oil changes and routine Maintainance. Sometimes did oil changes after 7000 miles and car just ran forever. In deep snow the all wheel drive system is not the best but I used snow tires and never really had a problem. Way to go rav4 it’s the best car."
"04  9, 2019",The most reliable vehicle I've ever owned! LOVE!!,"Friends & family love this car! Drives like  8 cylinder, luxurious ride,  and plenty of room for passengers, luggage, etc.  I love driving this gem!"
"03 29, 2019",Recommend or Not Recommend,"So far so Good. This car has room for my legs and plenty of power for a 4 cyl.
It drives nice and has a smooth comfort ride to it."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota Dependability 5 stars,"Purchased a used 2013 awd Rv4 limited with 43K,now has 55K,not 1 issue,AWD great for our winters in Buffalo,peppy enuf,decent gas mileage,handles well,comfortable ride for a small suv,has all the amenities,2 minor Quips,the info screen is useless in sunlight,cant see the info at all,and,for a top of the line limited the door lock switches,window switches etc are not lit at night,come on toyota talk about cheaping out,all in all a great vehicle."
"02 17, 2019",Another great example of a high quality Toyota,"Excellent value and utility in a variety of uses

Very reliable  and stable on the road

Huge amount of flexible space 

My second RAV- drove the prior one for 9 years and over 90000 miles"
"02 16, 2019",Toyota Blizxard Pearl paint chips!  Buyer BEWARE,"I love my car.  However the paint is peeling like crazy. Toyota knows of the issue and refuses to do anything about it. Research the paint before you buy. I cannot even have my car detailed without losing huge chunks of paint! Blizzard Pearl Paint cannot even stick to the primer, the entire car has to be stripped, sanded, and painted with different everything.  #Toyotapaintpeels"
"01 31, 2019",Nice car,Very nice car.  It is very comfortable.  I am impressed with the ride quality.  The heater worked wonderfully.  Visibility is fantastic.  I am happy with the safety rating of the car as well.
"01 24, 2019",Good car for the money,My only complaint is too much road noise.  Good mileage. Great handling in any weather conditions.  Wonderful dealership.  Have had no problems other than  only needed a new battery after 5 years
"12  1, 2018","I liked the RAV4 so much, I bought it.","I drove a hr to test drive a Toyota RAV4. I liked it so much, I ended up buying it. It was definitely worth it."
"11 22, 2018",very reliable,"My second Rav4. Very reliable, economical, tons of room in the back. Peppy, reasonably quiet, shifts like a dream and will tow my 15' A-liner trailer!"
"11 20, 2018",Most reliable car ever .,"This car is comfortable and friendly for owner.Is very fast , light and nice .to driver.I can recommend these car for all futures  buyers.
I love him."
"11 17, 2018",Great all around car!,"This car is great for so many different situations that you need it for. It holds 5 people, cabin is very roomy(more than my old midsize suv), gets good fuel economy, and is reliable. The base sound system is amazing considering it isn?t upgraded or anything. It could have a little more power on the highway but otherwise performance is good and ride comfort is fine. It?s just a good average all around suv."
"11 13, 2018",Finally a Toyota Owner and I could not be happier!,"I had a small SUV for a few years that turned out to be a lemon and was on the hunt for a new or used small SUV. My family has long been a fan of Toyotas but I've never owned one. After lengthy research by myself and my husband we found a great price on a used RAV4 and went for a test drive. I was skeptical about having a 4 cylinder vehicle again after years of driving an Accord but I was super impressed with the way the RAV4 drove. I love the safety features (blind spot monitor, back up camera and side curtain airbags) and since I have the Limited package the leather and upgraded stereo made the car even more appealing. I've been averaging around 27mpg which is 6 better than my old car and really enjoy driving again. I have a 35 minute commute to work one way and this small SUV has been great. I'm anxious to see how it fares with an Ohio winter. I would suggest this vehicle to anyone looking to purchase a small SUV. It has a real transmission (unlike many other in its class) and the safety features are top notch."
"11  7, 2018",Good car,Nice vehicle. 4 cyl is surprisingly sprightly for a naturally aspirated engine. AWD in a small SUV was just what I needed. Should be reliable.
"10 28, 2018",Awesome Car,"Great vehicle, service records were available. Salesman Steve Groves was awesome! Would recommend to anyone. Great sales team & showroom. Service folks were nice as well."
"10 10, 2018",Very happy with the Toyota Rav4.,"Excellant warranty.   Covered tourque converter even though the veh.
was several months past the 5 yr warranty.   That was the only problem that I ever had with the veh.  Very dependable;  comfortable, and great gas milage.   Just bought a new 2018 Toyota Rav5 to replace this one."
"10  5, 2018",Reliable & versatile,"We have owned all Toyota models (except carolla).
They, over the years have proven to be extremely reliable, long lasting & have great resale value. 
After owning a 1995 RAV, 2013 Redesign appears to be larger than older models. Ride & seats are very comfortable."
"07 25, 2018",Amazing Car for a Reasonable Price,Wanted a reliable car that was perfect for all the seasons that Colorado has to offer and my Rav4 is a perfect fit. A sleek interior and bluetooth radio lets your drive in style.
"07 10, 2018","Comfortable, Economical and Reliable!","Happy first time Toyota RAV4 owner. Reliable in any weather. Reasonably comfortable, economical on gas. Spacious, easy for passengers + cargo. Disappointed 2013 NO COMPASS!!!"
"07  2, 2018",Rav 4,"The car met all my needs for safety, economical, good value and good price. I would highly recommend this model to my friends and family."
"06 30, 2018",Most reliable car I own I give my RAV4,"This car has great leg room in the back seat and the front too the parking is better, runn perfect , love the stereo system"
"06 30, 2018",I love this suv is  great to drive and parking ?,"This car has camera for parking , blue tooth, great stereo system economy and gas right great ? I love my RAV4 I am happy ?"
"05 25, 2018",Best investment for me!,This car has been great for me though any kind of weather. The interior is super comfy and spacious. The exterior is very sharp to the eye! Most of all it?s rated super safe!
"05 11, 2018",Reliable vehicle,"We have always had great luck with Toyota vehicles: Camry and RAV 4.
Internet Auto Brokers wrote into the contract that we could have the car checked with our choice of mechanics and our trusted garage gave its blessing."
"05  3, 2018",Love my car,The car is amazing. I love how it drives . It?s comfortable and overall better on gas . I love how it feels like a car but is and suv
"04 28, 2018",My dream Car,"The Car is in excellent shape and no matter the rudeness of dealership, I'm  still in love the car. I am coming from driving a Honda CRV and wanted to try Toyota. Love the RAV4 better"
"03 30, 2018",Love it,"I've had it for almost 5 years now, and still really enjoy it. Over-all, most reliable car I've ever owned.  Other than a cracked front window from a stone chip, the only think I've done on this car is oil changes. Built so well!"
"03 23, 2018",Toyota Rav4,"This car is perfect for me.  I'm short and not all cars fit very well for short people.. But this rav4 is great.. Wonderful gas milage,  very comfortable,  and roomie my husband is tall and it works for him too..."
"03 16, 2018",Great affordable car i purchase,I fell inlove with this car. Its very comfortable and very economic. It drives so smooth and very spacious inside. It feels like brand new car.
"02 25, 2018",Mister,Sporty and roomy and has some spunk love the blue tooth feature. I like the backup camera and all the room in the back for storage.
"02 15, 2018",I love the reliabilty of toyota,"It's good looking and also excellent on gas. I love how it zipps around town, it's so easy to drive and park and I know it will last for years to come!"
"01 29, 2018",Like driving chocolate. Smooth and silky.,"I have been driving a Subaru for the last few years I loved it, but wanted a small SUV that sat a little higher and had less miles. I found my 2013 Toyota Rav4  on car gurus. I love it!. The exterior styling is sleek and inside, luxurious. The back up camera is so helpful, as is the Bluetooth. And who doesn't love a moon roof!!. I'm looking forward to many adventures in my new Toyota."
"01 13, 2018",Love my Rav!!,This SUV is great. I love the all wheel drive and my back seat bench seating. The back seat is adjustable for you to lay back which is awesome! Lots of trunk space. I've had my 2013 RAV4 limited for 5 years
"01  8, 2018","This is my 2nd RAV4, both bought new.",My title says it all... it's one of my best investment made. Best value for the money and reliability and quality.
"12 10, 2017",My favorite Car of ALL Time,"I love my Rav4. The car far exceeds my expectations and the mileage advertised by Toyota. On my recent trip to Atlantic City, I was able to get well over 35 mpg on straight highway driving. I have plenty of room in the trunk for my folding bike plus luggage. The seating is comfortable and the way they are designed, they hold you on sharp curves."
"12  1, 2017",Good car,"The car has met my needs, but I preferred my Mitsubishi Outlander for perks. It drives well, but I had to replace tires at under 30,000 miles and warranty had just expired because it was already over 3 years old."
"11 27, 2017",Love the exterior of our Rav 4,We love our Rav 4 lots of room like all the extras included in our purchase we have always owned a Toyota  along with our grown children who also own Toyotas.
"11 21, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"This is my second RAV4, you can't go wrong with them... Toyota makes a good product and although you're going to pay more upfront, in the long run you'll have saved as maintenance is minimal cause they're built to last. I spent next to nothing in my last one compared to some and I had it a little over 10 yrs. Great Mid size SUV, sporty and fun to drive, absolutely love mine."
"11 15, 2017",Crashed,"I was T boned directly into the drivers door/front tire from a CRV traveling over 55mph.  Every airbag deployed as I spun multiple times, ending up off the road down in a field.  I climbed out of the passengers side with only a limp.  I am thankful every safety feature of this Toyota protected me."
"11  4, 2017",$2 BILL,Fun driving spacious vehicle where I can carry bowling xxxxx and golf clubs without having to take one or the out of the car...
"10 22, 2017",The best car I have owned,"Toyota's are my favorite male of cars. My first was a Camry that went far beyond 200k miles. My favorite model years ago was my Avalon, again going over 200 k miles. My next car was Camry which at 200k mi was given to a young couple needing a car 2 years ago and it is still a smooth ride. I now own the BEST car I have ever owned, a Rav4. I bought a 2013 fully loaded car 1 1/2 yrs ago.  It is great on gas. It drives smoothly and the all wheel drive was exceptional last winter."
"10 22, 2017",Most comfortable and reliable car I've owned.,"This car makes hauling anything very easy. Very spacious, and comfortable to ride in. This car has been extremely reliable since the day I got it. I have a 45 minute commute to work every day and this car makes the time fly by with its AUX chord plug in option, and smooth riding experience."
"10 18, 2017",Most super performance car I owned,"This is my first car ever and never regretted my decision of buying it. Its very comfortable, good mileage, less maintenance issues and great for long drives. Never got a back pain even with ling drives and hill drives."
"09 26, 2017",RAV4 is an awesome ride!,All around great SUV. Superbly spacious & ride is smooth. Great on gas mileage as well. Love my RAV4.
"09 12, 2017",Best All Around Car!,"This vehicle is stylish, fun to drive, great gas mileage.  I've owned all kinds of cars, I never thought a Toyota would meet all my needs and then some.   I liked it so much I got one for our Daughter.  I absolutely love this car!"
"08 23, 2017",This is my first Toyota and I love it!!,I love the RAV4 and how it handles! There's nothing I don't like about it! I will always and forever buy Toyotas from now on!
"08 17, 2017",Is the best and most reliable vehicle ever,"These has met all my needs, its easy to transport my family,entertainment is enhanced,it is cormfotable in terms of seats,wheels are okay and more other features."
"08  7, 2017",Beautiful on the outside; could use more on the in,Looks great; drives well. Can't get past the fact the fact that this car does not have a bin for my sunglasses inside. Bought this after owning a 2006 Sienna XLE Limited and am disappointed that the 2013 RAV4 is not even half as luxurious as concerns inside storage space and smooth ride
"08  2, 2017","dependable, great for an SUV, just not what I want","I purchased this SUV w the thoughts of needing cargo space .... practicality, but my heart is in need of a convertible w some punch..... prev owned toyota convertible, the back up camera in my Rav & bluetooth are both great extras, sharp but seems this model is similar to several other SUVs produced @ this time, would like better if had unique look separating from others designs overall though drives well & is dependable.... Toyota does seem to offer more ""extras"" for the $ also"
"07 16, 2017",Extremely Reliable Care!,"The Toyota Rav4 is an exceptional car for my money. The 2.5L DOHC 4 Cyl Engine puts out a healthy 275hp and 172lb-ft of torque. Plenty of pep as well as great gas mileage. It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology! If you're looking a great crossover SUV, put this one on your list to test drive."
"07 10, 2017",Great Mid-Size Car,"Bought this car just before starting our family.  We really wanted something safe, reliable, and had a good amount of space without being too big.  This fit the bill, we love this Rav4!  It also does great in snow and off road which is a good plus for us."
"07  9, 2017",RAV4 super car,"WOW.... This is one gorgeous RAV.... Loaded with features and options, backed by Toyota, this is a must have. Not only is the color amazing, the ride is awesome, and the comfort is top notch"
"07  6, 2017",Reliable and Efficient Car,"I used to drive Sedan, and getting into SUV has given me a what I was looking for, specifically more space for my children which served as family car for short and long trips."
"06 29, 2017",Very good on gas and very comfortable.,Love the color of interior. Best comfort on our trips we have taken. 28-30 miles to gallon on trips. I would buy another one when needed.
"06 28, 2017",Great pickup for a 4 cylinder,"I bought this 2013 vehicle new, currently have 64k miles on it, and have enjoyed driving it. It has great pickup, which helps in quick passing in tight spots. It is comfy (of course I'm not a tall/big person). I've had to date no major service issues."
"06 11, 2017",Comfortable ride!,"I really liked my Toyota Rav4. It was a great size for someone who doesn't love large SUV's but wants some cargo space, or has a family. The car was very reliable, and drove awesome. I did feel like it had some slight issues in snow (after further research realized it was probably just my model) driving, and heavy rain. The weight distribution was slightly off, and the back end would slide slightly. Still loved the car, and would totally recommend!"
"06  5, 2017",Is my 2nd Toyota.  They do it right.,"When I test drove this previously owned SUV, I realized there have been many advances in features I have missed.  My Rav 4 is such a pleasure to drive."
"06  1, 2017",Cant recommend it,"I bought this RAV4 to replace my F150. I had F150s for over 20 yrs and they just got too big for my needs, enter the RAV. The car did everything I wanted except for the comfort of the seats, after 20 mins I would get pain in the back of my legs regardless of how I positioned the seat, I could vary it a bit but never eliminate the pain and discomfort. I put 25,000 miles a year on this car so I can speak with good authority on these below average seats. It doesn't present in the test drive but on longer drives its torture. The F-150s are all day long comfortable as is the Subaru Outback that replaced this RAV4. Toyota made a nice vehicle with the RAV that suits the needs of many consumers but failed in the driver/car interface in epic fashion. The Nissan Murano outclasses the RAV by light years in seat comfort.  BEWARE if you are shopping a RAV4 try a Nissan, Subaru... see how the seat feels and think long and hard before getting that RAV. Other than that it was very good in all other areas but lets face it, if you dread even short trips in your car it doesn't matter what else it does, it has to meet a minimum comfort level and the RAV 4 does not, not even close."
"05 16, 2017",Best vehicle purchase ever!,"I only wished I'd gotten remote open/close on the door of the storage area. Seats let down for more storage space and when I open my sunroof, I'm in a sports vehicle. The sound system is awesome. I'm not a soccer mom, just like the room and the idea of having space for everything when needed. This is such a cool vehicle to drive, some knee discomfort; and as we all know, Toyota is a mainstay of reliability! One thing, the driver's seat leg room, distance between the seat and the accelerator/brake is a little uncomfortable for me, I try adjusting the seat to different positions but to no avail, smh.  This is causing my right knee to ache, be uncomfortable."
"05  5, 2017",Just what I needed!,"The model I got is not as ""glitzy"" as some SUVs, however, that's really not what I was looking for in a vehicle. I need decent leg room for a tall husband, and the RAV4 provides plenty. Gas mileage is definitely a selling point, as is the reliability typically associated with Toyota. The outside looks impressive and sleek, but I do think that the inside could use a bit more refinement. Turning and overall ride were tight and smooth. It's perfect for carting the family!"
"03 30, 2017",You want one,"The newer rav4 is a great small SUV for everyday use with lots of space for the random times you need it. I love the laws.  I say best small suv, out there and plus it doesn't look like a bubble!"
"03 28, 2017",Toyota Rav 4,"I really really love this vehicle. I went from driving a Nissan Sentra 2003 to a 2013 Rav 4  so this is quite  the upgrade. So far I have no complaints with the car besides a leaking sunroof. I'm not really sure why that is (I haven't looked into yet) but I went for a touchless car wash and the entire front interior of my car got wet. In terms of driving performance, it's a very smooth and comfortable ride. You won't even know when you hit 120 km/h but it does get slightly noisy when you do. In terms of gas, it's not as great as I thought it would be even on eco mode, but it's still quite good. For an SUV it definitely drives like a regular Sports car and doesn't take up space when parking. Overall, I'd say it's one of those vehicles that make you find reasons to drive. :)"
"03 27, 2017",Bought a Rav4,"Great deal, good service from BigM Chevrolet in Radcliff, Ky. 
 Ask for sales rep Tiffany Frizzell."
"03 25, 2017",Great SUV!,"I just bought a 2013 Rav4 Limited a week ago, and I am LOVING it! It is so comfortable and surprisingly roomy. All the safety features are fantastic, I feel like my family is much more protected. It has so many options that make it fun to drive."
"03 22, 2017",I just bought it,"I just bought the car about a week ago. The rear window wiper needed to be replaced (20k miles). Other than that...everything great so far. Very good gas mileage, comfortable ride, lots of space, and drives well in snow"
"03 22, 2017",The newest car i ever owned,i LUV THIS CAR IT DRIVES SO NICE AND IS COMFY. Has alot of gadgets i never knew came on a car. It quite and drives like a dream
"03 21, 2017",Overall very reliable car,Great vehicle Great gas mileage and comfortable interior. It is very good in the winter weather. Dealership always excellent with service.
"03 17, 2017",The car I needed most,I never expect that this car is so big inside. Its a suv that i never expect im gonna get but its good on gas
"03 16, 2017",Dima was Amazing,"I had an amazing experience with Dima. He provided amazing customer service, i loved the service he provided !"
"03 11, 2017",best car ever!,"I love my Rav4, second one I have purchased! Always reliable, they are comfortable, economical and you can use it for almost anything! They are the best!"
"02 18, 2017",Rav Too...,Purchased a certified pre-owned 2013 Rav4 Limited and all I can say is Wow!! I absolutely love this vehicle. Truth be told I sure see a huge difference between this and the 2003 Rav4 L that I previously had. Way bigger way more powerful way more room and tons quieter. Not sure why people complain about noise because mine is ultra quiet. For starters tires are very important. Mine came with noncheap Cooper CS3  all Season Touring tires that are so smooth and quiet and handle great. The design is sexy and upscale. I do agree with those that mention the door extensions and yes they do tend to collect dirt and snow. I really don't let that dampen my spirits. Overall I Really Love my Rav4 Limited. In Silver metallic it's really HOT....
"01 27, 2017",Not what I expected from Toyota,"2013 rav 4 Limited needed a tourque converter with 40,000 miles then a new transmission at 49,000 and still has no pick up. Overall worse purchase of my life! So disappointed and will no longer purchase any type of a Toyota"
"03 26, 2016",Great Reliable Car for the Money!,"We purchased a used 2013 Toyota Rav4 XLE roughly a month ago with about 40,000 miles, and while this vehicle has it's drawbacks in areas, most of them I can live with. My previous vehicle was a 99 Toyota Tacoma with manual transmission. In comparison the Rav4 drives and rides like a dream. I will say that it does have a stiff ride to it, which seems to be a common complaint, but I still find it to be a fairly comfortable overall. I'm mostly a city driver and don't think I would be doing much off-roading with this vehicle. Mostly just wanted something that would handle well in the winter. I love that the rear seats recline, which is a nice feature for passengers in the vehicle. The cars computer system is a little clunky, and the interface could be a little more user friendly. I had a few issues with keeping my phone connected via bluetooth, but a quick internet search and updating the cars firmware quickly resolved those issues. The usb plug and play feature for music is nice. Put your music on a jump drive and play it directly through the audio system. We actually put all our music on an old hard drive we had laying around and plugged it in through a usb cable, so I have my whole library in the car wherever we go. The voice command does not work terribly well and often misinterprets or cannot understand what you are saying to it. Not a huge deal as I find this to be a useless feature on most devices, such as my cell phone. It works well for dialing numbers and answering phone calls, which is all I really need it to do anyway. Navigation voice command is touch and go. Beware that this vehicle takes synthetic oil, which is more expensive.The trade off is you only have to change it every 10,000 miles, so that will likely save you money overall as it's basically three oil changes in one. There is a noticeable difference between the Eco, Standard, and Sport mode (although very slight). I found that I actually get the same mileage in Standard mode that I do in Eco mode, but Eco has less power when you're driving and accelerating. I'm not terribly aggressive on the peddle though. Sport mode does eat up a little bit of the MPG, but the vehicle seems to be more responsive. 95% of the time I just leave it in standard mode. Gets about 29 MPG with mixed highway and city driving, which is the sticker MPG. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but I'm fairly certain I could get between 30-32 MPG. The gas tank is listed at almost 16 gal, but I've yet to get more than 13 into the tank when the vehicle gas warning light first comes on. It's possible that there are another 3 gallons of fuel in there, I guess you wouldn't know until you actually ran the vehicle out of fuel. I love the back up cam, which is a nice standard feature to have for those city parking situations. Overall I'm am happy with the Rav4 thus far. We bought it for more passenger room and Toyota's reliability. Time will tell. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking to buy one."
"03 23, 2016",Great Compact Crossver,"We have owned four Jeeps and got tired of the high cost of maintenance. We bought it as a Toyota Certified vehicle, it is extraordinarily good. We've owned it for three months and taken it into the mountains in snow, across the desert, and on 2-4 day cross country interstate trips from the Mojave to the Rockies and back. It's a keeper. It has three modes eco, regular and sport, and a very intelligent AWD system. Handles well, very comfortable, and while it does not have the ground clearance of a Jeep, we are extremely pleased with our purchase."
"03 22, 2016",Not at all impressed,"We bought our 2013 Rav4 new 3 years ago. We currently have 58,000 miles on it. There are 5 parking lot dings on the doors due to extremely thin metal. The ride is very rough, even with new tires, it is noisy on the highway. The canister oil filter is a real pain to replace....had to buy a special wrench from Toyota(expensive) and is almost worn out after 6 oil changes. The backup lights are very weak and hardly provide enough light when backing up. I really dislike the touch screen to change radio stations or other activities. In daylight you cannot see the screen. The Rav is missing numerous convenience storage spaces. Poor design overall, a elementary student could have given Toyota engineers better advise. Will be buying a CRV in near future...Very disappointed."
"06 29, 2015",Road noise and Yokahama tires,"I ha d 31 X 10.50 tires on my 94 pick-up that were quieter than the Yokohamas that came on my 2013 RAV4 XLE. These tires are the noisiest I ever owned with the exception of a set of Generals. When I hit even slightly rough road these tire are so loud I can't even hear the radio. Get a set a set of Michelin's as fast as you can.
The only other problem is that the large side panels are easily marred in parking lots. The vehicle needs side bumpers so that it doesn't look beat up in a very few years.
I fixed the glare on the interior backup screen by cutting a stiff piece of thin foam board around the top and sides. It isn't pretty but serves it's purpose.
All else considered I get great mileage 32.3 and putting it in sport mode to merge on the interstate is a thrill for the day. A very good vehicle that I would recommend, I'm still a Toyota fan just wish it came with quieter tires."
"05  6, 2015",Love. This. Vehicle!,"I just purchased my new (used) Rav 4 and I love it! It corners like it's glued to the road. The drive is so comfortable and even my 6' 2"" husband can sit very comfortably in the back seat! It's a dream."
"02 11, 2015",Enjoying the RAV4 Limited,"I've been very impressed with the vehicle so far. I came from an Acura RDX, which cost considerably more, but didn't offer any more features than the RAV4 Limited - and guzzled premium gas at 20 mpg. Although the Acura was more powerful, the RAV has plenty of pickup for all daily and highway driving. Pop it into Sport mode, and you get even quicker acceleration; or maximize your mileage in Eco mode - I average 25 mpg (about 60% city). I tested this SUV against the Mazda CX-5: although the Mazda may have been slightly sportier to drive (but not much), it fell way short of the RAV4 inside. The RAV is much more comfortable, roomy, and has all the luxury features (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) that the RDX had. I love the two-tone Terra Cotta interior. On the road, the ride is a nice balance between firm and shock-absorbing; it's not a Lexus, but it's quiet enough to make hands-free calls or listen to music (without blasting), and it handles all bumps smoothly. The sound system is quite good, and the navigation is adequate, though it has trouble finding points of interest. At 23,000 miles, I've had only two very minor issues: the rear hatch auto-opening mechanism (which I LOVE) had to be replaced (under warranty) when it failed, and the dashboard has started to rattle/squeak just a little, but only when the weather is below freezing. Unless the car falls apart, I expect to be happy with the RAV for years to come."
"01  9, 2015",Not much to brag about here,"There's not much I can say about the Toyota Rav4 LE except that it's a Toyota... which might mean a lot down the road. But for now, I'm not impressed. In fact, the 2013 Rav4 LE is really more irritating to me than anything else. There are features (or a lack of features) that are downright mystifying. When in park, the car rolls forwards or backwards for a greater distance than any other car I've owned. I haven't a clue why, except be careful that there's nobody behind you or in front of you when you put it in park. Otherwise, their toes might get squished. The plastic panels along the bottom of the front doors allow for all kinds of debris, dirt, snow and grime to enter the car's lower door interior. Again, why? What on earth were the engineers thinking when they added this lower door extension with a plastic shroud? The ""spoiler"" in the back just prevents your car from getting cleaned when in a car wash. Speaking of car washes, if you don't have a roof rack, watch out; the roof rack channel trim has a tendency to ""pop"" lose when going through the car wash's blow dryer. It happened to me twice.Toyota has no recommended solution for this.
I have a black interior. Which makes it extremely difficult to see the door handles and window and door lock buttons in the dark. Buttons are not backlit for the most part when the headlights are on. The auto window feature for the driver's side works when putting the window down -- but why not a one-touch feature for putting the window back up? What's the point of that? Very deceiving are the windshield wipers. On the turn signal, Toyota shows ""INT"" for intermittent wipers. In reality, there's nothing intermittent about the wipers at all. They turn on for slow speed or fast speed. Or not at all. That's it. They are not variable timing wiper blades. What car made today does not have this as a standard feature? This is 20 year old technology. I guess the answer is Toyota. Unbelievable. How cheap can you be? Although the interior looks refined, it's cheap and is prone to scratches and I suspect poor longevity. I had a stain on the silver rim of the air vent. When I went to wip the stain off with my licked finger... the silver paint came off!! Either I have the most caustic saliva known to man or Toyota is using the cheapest silver spray paint in the world. I'm going with the latter. The muffler or tailpipe rattles in idle making it sound like you have an exhaust leak. The brakes squeak when going in reverse. Cheap rotors? The engine is noisy. The undercarriage sound proofing is deafening... deafeningly loud. The heater / AC fan barely blows out anything in positions one and two. The doors feel lightweight and cheap. The salesman said ""Hey, you gotta shave back on something in order to get better mileage."" The transmission is an oxymoron. Why would you need a six speed auto transmission for a 4 cylinder car? How much gas savings can that really bring? As a six speed transmission, it always feels like the car doesn't know what gear to be in. As a driver, I feel like the transmission might go at any minute becauseof the way the transmission behaves. Very perplexing -- and as I said previously, irritating. I could go on and on about the irritating features this car has but I'm winded from complaining. If ten years from now I enjoy a trouble-free experience with this car, I'll overlook its idiosyncrasies, but until then I'm forced to live with these ""irritating"" features."
"10 29, 2014",Lacks basic features,"Toyota has gone cheap on this SUV.
We have the SLE with Nav package. It is very hard to see on a bright day and very limited in information provided.
Back-up camera is next to useless and gets blurred if it is raining.
We spend 5 months a year in the US and our Canadian model has no way to switch from Kilometres to miles also the GPS does not give a speed read out.
There is no DC power outlet for a cooler in the back seat.
We went from a 10 year old SUV to this and don't find it has as many features."
"10 23, 2014",2013 Rav4,"I'm enjoying this car. I've had RAV 4 in the past and I'm having a great time in this one. Added features off the power moonroof, fog lights,led screen miles analysis, control heating and the added 4 wheel drive feature is great. Now I have all wheel drive and 4 wheel drive in the same vehicle. The backup camera is great. The Sport mode and Eco mode also gives 2 options of control. I'm happy finally to get back into a SUV."
"10  3, 2014",Went from a Mustang to the Rav4 and LOVING it!!,"I bought my Rav4 brand new in the end of year sales December 27th and got a great deal on the price. I get 27.3 miles per gallon and I am at times very heavy on the gas. I have put just over 16,000 miles as this is a work vehicle for me and it still runs like the first day!! When I am on the road whether its highway or city the noise is very quiet compared to having a mustang before this!! The inside plastic is a little easy to scratch and I don't like having cloth on the door where you will be touching a lot but its a car not a house. I love the back up camera, cruise control and bluetooth! Three things that don't come standard on all vehicles in its category. This car also does great in very heavy rain where roads are flooded! I wouldn't have even know I was driving on a flooded road if the water wasn't spraying everywhere!! It did GREAT!! I do wish that the windshield wipers had more than slow, fast and faster but its just a pet peeve of mine and I can get over it. Tons of legroom in the back! Love that the back seats recline too! All around this vehicle is great!!"
"09  7, 2014",Wish I had not bought it...,"I waited 7 years for a new vehicle and had my heart set on the Rav-4 or the Honda CRV. We went with the 2013 Rav-4, I loved the look of it. Had I known then what I know now, I would have never bought it. At the test drive, I noticed all of the hard plastic inside, but did not realize how cheap it made the interior. Within 4 weeks we had an issue with the driver's door. We were told the ""welds"" had all come loose and a new door was ordered from Canada. Then parts of the roof rack came off, we went back to the dealer and had that replaced. A month or so later, the same parts came off the roof rack again! We never used the roof rack. My vehicle was white, my 4th white vehicle, under every door handle, under the gas tank door and under the two mirrors, each time it rained, black drip marks went down the entire vehicle at each of these places. Needless to say, at 4200 miles, I was done. I traded the vehicle in. We have a 2000 Toyota Sienna and the quality of that vehicle is so much better than the 2013 Rav-4. The vehicle I had seemed to be cheaply made, and it was not a cheap vehicle. This was our 4th Toyota, it will probably be our last."
"07 20, 2014",2013 Toyota RAV4 XLE,"Might be a little soon for this, but since the car is a 2013 model and it's July 2014 it's probably a good time since I'm now the second owner of this car. I purchased the TRav over the 4th of July just before my vacation to the ocean. After a 3 hour drive there, local Ocean City driving, and 3 hours back, I'm puzzled as to why the previous owner didn't keep the vehicle. Fun to drive; carried hubby and three teens around for a week or so and no complaints. Hubby has mostly all positive things to say also. Plenty of rear seat leg room and storage in the rear, and boy did we have it loaded down. Tks Toyota for the large side mirrors. Whoever thought of their size considered people like us that have the rear stuffed to the roof and no rear view mirror visibility. I was able to compensate just fine, and plan to purchase a roof rack. Believe me this isn't a knock to the TRav, but just an idea of what we packed. ENGINE: Performance for a 4-banger is excellent. There's enough engine and transmission options (ECO boost, Sport, and the neat Standard/Auto shifting) to make me feel that I've got enough options for all driving situations, and believe me I've used them so far. It's got some serious pep and delivers quickly. Gas mileage appears to be as advertised, but I'll probably be able to extend that carpooling back and forth from work since it's mostly highway. Soooo much better than my previous vehicle. TECHNOLOGY: Ok, this will be short from me since that wasn't much of a concern during purchase (Yeah, I'm in my early 50s - it shows). Love the back up camera, awesome bluetooth, excellent audio system, and hookups for iPODs, teenager gizmos, etc. Did I mention I love the bluetooth. Never thought I'd hear myself say that. ISSUES: Lack of lumbar support for cloth seats - Hubby has back issues so he's sensitive about this. See light color under scratches in red paint, but I plan to touch up and I'm very good at that sort of thing, so don't expect it to be a big problem. 4 stars for value for the money and reliability since that would depend on how trouble free the Rav will be in the future. Given the history of the Rav I'm hoping it will warrant 5 stars in a couple of years :) Additional PLUSES: Love how Toyota has the bottom of the body covered with the plastic and integrated into the bumpers. Figure I'll need that additional protection if we have another winter full of Polar Vortexes. Thought the dash design (bump out area to the glove box) was a bit odd at first, but after traveling around I've warmed up to it because it makes fiddling with the buttons easier. Lot's of additional hidden storage for tools and space around the spare tire for additional things. I'm a chick that likes her tools. All in all, I'm very happy with this vehicle and would recommend to a friend. Almost seems as though it was made just for me :)"
"06 24, 2014",Average vehicle,"We had a 2007 highlander, great car was a hybrid and got 28mpg consistently. The 2013 Rav 4 has great looks but it stops there. It's noisy, clunky ride and worst of all overstated mileage by toyota. We have coasted, drove flat roads, been very light on the gas and the best we get is 24.1 on highway and 22.4 in town in easy suburban driving. Had 4 toyotas, 2 highlanders, camray and this is the most disappointing mileage. Would not recommend."
"05  9, 2014",Average at best,"I have owned the RAV for about one year. I bought it based on previous experience with Toyota vehicles and a good trade-in offer I got from my dealer for my previous car - my net-out-of-pocket on the RAV was ~$2-3k less than other comparable CUVs.

After one year of ownership the best I can rate this car is ""average"". The only real positive is the amount of cargo and passenger space. In every other area the car falls short, especially comparing to competition. It's noisy, has a very stiff and uncomfortable suspension, safety ratings are mediocre (below key competitors), transmission behavior is strange and disconcerting, mileage is OK but not outstanding. Bottom line - just average. Not a bad car, but easily outclassed by several competitors in its class."
"05  3, 2014",2013 Rav4,"Had an awesome experience purchasing my very first brand new car. I worked with Umesh, who helped me find the car I wanted withing my budget."
"05  1, 2014",I love it more every day!,"I've owned by RAV4 LE for 6 months. We had lots of snow this winter. The RAV always made me feel comfortable that I had good control of the vehicle. The windshield wipers and defrost work well. The gas mileage as calculated by the onboard computer says I've averaged 27.2 miles per gallon over the first 5400 miles. My manual calculation has it at 25.1mpg. I drive around with it in eco mode most of the time. When I'm in a passing or merging situation I reach over and press the sport mode button. The transmission will immediately drop 1 to 2 gears depending on my timing with the gas pedal. I love that button. The paddle shifting option doesn't work as fast. I'm 54, my 22 year old son agrees that the sport button works best when you are mostly operating in eco mode. The low load floor with no lip and lift gate rear make loading and unloading super easy. I'm not a super tech geek, so not having the GPS or blind spot sensors, found on the more expensive models, doesn't cause me any regret. I do like the back up camera. The side mirrors are large and well placed for backing up. My first car was a 1967 Dodge Coronet with shoulders that the RAV4 also tastefully incorporates. Great visibility, very strong cornering ability (this is not a sports car), good options for controlling the acceleration vs mpg, plenty of useful space, all come together to keep me smiling. The one area that I wish it were just a bit better is the left foot rest for the driver. That is a bit small and angled wrong for me."
"04 30, 2014",2013 Rav 4 Ltd.,"Outstanding vehicle in every respect. We would highly recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a reliable, comfortable, economical and fun car."
"04 19, 2014",What a neat car,"WE bought our 2013 Rav4 Limited in November 2013. We were originally there to replace our tires on our 2010 Corolla and something catches our eye in the dealership. The Rav4 had the most compelling exterior design from the chrome in the headlamps to the ""rest-your arm"" on the rear-tail light. It was quite a change from the previous generation and it has grown on us. We decided to test drive a gray colored one. The ride wasn't too bad (but we own a rough-riding sports car so we are used to some bumps) but Toyota probably made it a little firm for handling purposes. The road noise was pretty minimal and when you opened the sunroof at 50+ mph, it was a little noisy. What REALLY made up our minds to buy the car were the immense amounts of technological features that it came with. Push button start with easy door-unlocking/locking, auto-dimming rearview mirror (this is great for that annoying headlight glare during the night), the great navigation unit, the blind spot monitor system with back up assist (although we wished the blind spot monitor made a noise when you tried to change lanes into another car), the vast amount of rear cargo space, the heated seats, the high driving position, and the bluetooth connectivity. I know that was a long list, but it was totally worth mentioning because it makes this car 100 times better than base models. The only problem we had since we bought the car was the power lift gate. Here in Florida we have lots of rainstorms. Water managed to get into the power lift mechanism in the gate and caused it to have a terrible squeak aw it went up. Fortunately toyota replaced it for free and it hasn't squeaked since. I use the car daily and gas mileage could be a little better. I know its rated around 26/31 but i feel like I've been getting a little worse, maybe 22/27. The transmission can be pretty smooth but if you been in a rodeo, the chassy seems to heave and ho upon acceleration. Its not the smoothest but its do-able. Rear leg room and head roof is plenty (I'm 6'0 and i fit perfectly fine behind my driving position. The two-toned leatherette seats are comfy but seem to wrinkle a little because the seat bolsters are in the way when getting in the car, so you are rubbing against it all the time. The eco mode has terrible acceleration but that's to save gas; the sport mode is peppy and good for fast-er accelerations and overtaking on highways, however, this accounts for poor gas mileage. I use normal mode for city driving. Overall, the Rav4 is a great deal with all the features it has. A bang for your buck. I would recommend it for families that want to take a nice cross-country road trip or those who use it to commute to work. Toyota truly lives up to their slogan with this car ""Let's go places""."
"04  1, 2014",Thankfully I don't do a lot of driving...,"I drove a 2009 Rav4 LE for almost 5 years and absolutely loved it. Now that I have the new 2013 Rav4 LE, I find myself wishing at times that I still had my old one...

I was given a brand new, 15 miles on the odometer, 2013 Rav4 from the dealership just over 2 months ago. I definitely like the interior more than the 2009 version with the back up camera, touch screen display, bluetooth, etc., but I also miss a couple of the old features too. I feel like there's less storageup front and the extrerior tends to scratch very easily. A lot of plastic additions and kind of silly to see fake plastic parts where lights would go on a higher edition. I don't have a far commute to work, so my gas mileage has been pretty decent, but I've never felt 100% comfortable in the car. I didn't even get off the lot yet, before turning the car around to ask why the brakes were making noise -- I was told they had to be ""broken in"" because it was sitting on the lot for so long. Brought the car back 4 days later because the bluetooth wasn't working correctly. I was told by 2 different people (including a specialist) that they didn't know how to fix it and I needed to bring it in for service.

Fast forward 2 months and the car has less than 2,000 miles on it. Not only does the transmission and acceleration make me nervous -- down shifts very quickly and has ""jumped"" forward on a couple occassions when putting the car into reverse. The engine has also been making a ""squealing/whining"" noise since I first got it when driving below 45mph and has a difficult time driving up hill. I've had to put my foot almost to the floor for it to accelerate. I plan on bringing the car in for service in the next couple of weeks and make note of these problems.

My 2009 Rav NEVER had a problem in the 4+ years that I had it. No engine noise, comfortable, no leaks, etc. I loved that car...this new one, is not so impressive. I think Toyota is a great car, but I'll think twice about getting another Rav4 once my lease is up in 3 years."
"02 14, 2014","Oh Hello, Space Ship.","First of all, I traded in my base-model chevy coupe for my next car, so anything I purchased would far surpass it. However, the 2013 Toyota Rav4 Limited was the best vehicle I test drove.

Having automatic-everything for the first time worried me a bit. The more electronics in the car, the more expensive it is to fix. Since it's a lease, I'm not too concerned with this issue. I especially like that I get the opportunity to replace my key fabs twice a year if anything happens to them.

I love everything about this car, especially the Blind Spot Monitor. I didn't think I would notice the light signals in the mirrors, but the sales guy, Brian Dobbs, convinced me to get it. It proved its worth within the first week of purchasing the Rav4.

PROS: Two Power Seat Setting buttons for the driver side so both me and a second person can switch back and forth in the driver side seat with ease. Seat Warmers, All-Wheel Drive. I love how the inside lights turn on when I walk up to the car. I flipped out the first night I witnessed it. I can connect my phone via bluetooth and use the car speakers to make phone calls (super plus!). The sound quality of the phone conversation isn't bad either. It gets good mileage, almost the same as my old coupe.

CONS: I thought it was strange that there aren't rear vents for the back passengers. Since I don't drive people around on a frequent basis, I'm not sure how this affects their experience. I also think it's odd that the middle cup holders for the back passengers are inside the center arm rest. If three people sit in the back, the middle person has to hold their drink. Again, this doesn't affect my experience with the car."
"02 13, 2014",2013 rav4 diesel,"We are the proud owners of a new rav diesel and I am pleased to say that that it is a delight to drive our trip from the dealers to home on the freeway averaged 5.5L/100 km and is whisper quite .Cannot fault the fit and finish however some brands like Hyundai put more effort into upholstery detail .We are stepping out of a 2002 s60 volvo and we find the seats to almost as good as the volvo .
It represented a more practical car than a hybrid vehicle .
With the vehicle set on cruise control 100 km/ hour on country roads it was un stoppable having mountains of toque to negotiate steep inclines.."
"02 10, 2014",Enjoying my Rav4 xle,"I have had my Rav4 XLE almost 3 weeks. LOVE IT, fun to drive. I had a Ford Edge and the gas milage was killing me. So happy Toyota changed the style of the exterior."
"02  1, 2014",one of the best car's I have ever owned,"This car is just the right size. Performs very well. I get great gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25 miles per gallon. It handles great in the snow. That is the number one reason I bought the Rav 4. I wanted all wheel drive. The technology in this car is fantastic. from the great sounding radio to the blind spot monitor, the backup screen, and the nav system and of course the Bluetooth for my phone and music. I really like the apps, such as Pandora.

Overall, this is one of the best cars I have ever owned and would recommend it. Toyota's service is second to none and that is extremely important in owning this vehicle."
"01 28, 2014",Hold On,"I have owned my Rav4 for six months and have owned many different cars and trucks in almost
50 years of driving . This is by far the vehicle with
the worst ride I have ever owned."
"01 21, 2014",Great Car,"I love my 2013 rav4 xle. Bought for my wife and wished it was for me. Great mileage and great exterior body. The only negatives is no leather or heated seats. camera works good when it doesn't snow or rain. Love the touchscreen on the dash. very impressed, i'm a honda person and glad i didn't buy crv. I live in Virginia and drive to Kansas and myrtle beach once a year. Drive for fun to D.C., Richmond alot. Love the white paint."
"01  1, 2014",Good car but Toyota cutting corners from earlier m,"I traded in my 2010 Rav4 for the 2013 model so I feel I can make a valid comparison. My 2010 LTD was a V6 so I knew going in that I was giving up excellent acceleration for a s0-so 4 cyl. But when considered against the new features of the 2013 I decided to trade it in. I got tired of the large swing door and lack of technology as found in the newer models. But here's where they cut some corners:
1. The spare tire is now inside (nice) but is no longer a full size tire and wheel but a temp.
2. The 2010 had real leather seats, now they employ something called ""soft-tek"" leather substitute.
3. The center console no longer two levels, just one large box.
4. On the 2010 there was a secondary glove box that had a push button release. Replaced by an open bin.
5. The interior and dashboard use more cheap looking plastic and no one will be fooled into thinking the carbon fiber surface is real.
6. One less 12V outlet and no 110V a/c outlet.

Even with all of the above, I don't regret buying this car. It's a good reliable vehicle with some nice technology. The price is lowest in it's class and the mileage is great. I get 28 mpg overall and it uses regular gas. However, if they brought back the V6 I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"12 22, 2013",You can't Make This Up,"Stranded at the dealership with a Uhaul in tow I asked the Sales guy to take me on a test drive with something comparable to my luxury vehicle which just decided to ""break up with me"". He suggested a Toyota Rav 4 Limited and I laughed saying I don't think so. I wanted comfort, a smooth ride, leather heated seats, auto seat adjustment with memory, navigation, performance with some get up and go. And decent gas mileage. No way was I expecting this in the Rav4 but I was wrong. Words that do not normally come out of my mouth. The Rav4 Limited is Awesome! Great ride, super cool looking, the performance is far beyond what I expected. Hugs the corners, has some power for a 4 Cylinder when in the Sport Mode. Surprising sound system, navigation and voice commend system is very nice and easy to use. Got a lot in this vehicle without the high ticket price of it's well known luxury model that I use to drive. Surprise, surprise. I love my Toyota Rav4 Limited."
"12 18, 2013",Honest Review 2013 RAV4 XLE AWD,"Let me start by saying that this may in fact be the right car for some but I will tell you about my experience with my current RAV4.
We found the Rav4 attractive for numerous reasons. We liked the overall styling of the exterior, though more black plastic than I liked but this seems to be a way for car manufactures to make some extra savings. I worried about it fading over time, which it will. I wasn't a fan of the rear end and I still do not care for it. this wasn't a deal breaker for me because what the exterior lacked the interior made up for it.
You get a lot of standard features on the XLE and that is why we chose it. Automatic Dual climate controls, roof rails, touch scree, back up cam, neat two tone color fabric, and so on.
We compared this to the escape (to small) and the CRV (noisy over the road).
PROs: smooth power train and enough power for the whole family. Me +3. roomy seating for all unless you squeeze 3 in the back. It's REALLY tight with three! Great cargo room even with the stroller. Road noise is minimal for this class compared to the competition. Nice interior and decent exterior.
This is why I'm rating this car so low and I have lost a lot of respect for Toyota quality.
CONS: The fake carbon fiber scratches extremely easy but the Toyota dealership replaced the scratched piece. Pretty nice of them. The ride is absolutely terrible! We did our initial test drive over some pretty smooth roads but once we got to driving it (after purchase) on other less improved surfaces, the ride was very noticeable. I'm pretty sure it's the rear suspension as it crashes over the smallest imperfections. The hood shakes and rattles all the time no matter the speed. There is a ""whine"" noise coming from the transmission when slowing down from 45+ mph. I also have some oil residue developing around the valve cover gasket. Toyota cannot find a leak. The transmission has a hard time on hills. Cruising at 70 mpg and climbing up a grade will case the transmission to downshift very hard once it finally engages. So hard that it woke my sleeping passengers and them asking if we hit something. All of these issues were brought to the dealerships attention and Toyota corporate. After several weeks and the car staying at the dealer for over two weeks, Toyota was unable to identify any problems. They took note of it and agreed with my complaints but say that these are characteristics of this vehicle. TOn top of all this, the bolts to the back hinge struts for the gate are developing rust and it is creating a rust streak down the column. Got to take it back to the dealer for this... yay, yet again.
After all of this I am pursuing the arbitration process and will try to get my money back. I cannot recommend this vehicle to anyone until they address these common issues with this model. Do a quick search or look on the forums and you will find I'm not the only with theses exact same problems.
I hate to say this, because I'm a Toyota fan, but do not buy this vehicle. If you choose to take anyways, PLEASE look for the problems I'm having as many others are experiencing the same. It's not worth it.... even for a Toyota."
"12  7, 2013",Car buying experience on a reliable car,The Toyota scion dealership in Apex NC made my car buying experience really smooth and fast. There was no pressure nor any hidden fees. I am very satisfied with overall experience. I will definitely recommend this place for new car buyers to try it out.
"11 28, 2013",Disappointed new RAV 4 owner,"I purchased a 2013 RAV 4 XLE with great expectations. What attracted me to this car was the exterior styling, well laid out and functional interior, back up camera, six speed automatic transmission, fairly peppy speed especially from the starting position, and good value for the price.

My disappointment has been the rear suspension ""slamming"" when driving over even modest speed bumps and breaks in the road, choppy transmission shifts especially in stop and go driving, loud muffler, and that incessant high pitched winding sound when accelerating that is so common to all Toyotas.

Of course when I asked the dealer to check out these aggravations, they predictably said it was ""normal"".

I previously owned a 2008 Honda CR-V and now wish I went with my gut and purchased a 2013 Honda CR-V.

I hope someone in authority from Toyota reads this review, takes it seriously, and start to make corrections to an otherwise very fine car."
"11 22, 2013","Nicest, and maybe last, car I've owned","RAV4 is roomy, with lots of extras standard; wouldn't have asked for Bluetooth or sun roof, but nice to have. Gas mileage is what Toyota posted, Solid feel, handles fine, peppy enough especially with EcoMode turned off (which we only do to get on the freeway). We drive cars for 10 years & 200,000 miles; hope this car will go at least that long."
"11  9, 2013",great deal,yours to discover this professionals and unbelievable sales representatives and great deal. and great car.
"11  8, 2013",Everything I needed and more,"Rides like a dream, turns on a dime... OK maybe a sliver dollar but tight. Gas mileage was excellent and it handles well in city and Long road trips. Entune is easy to set up and the auto seat settings for each driver is sure handy.

There is one minor disappointment, a nit ... that I've experienced in this superb vehicle - no built in garage door opener/Home Link capability.. Yep!!! Limited package I bought had all upgrades plus the dealer is so confident I received an extra year of No Cost Maintenance. And have we got room to spare. Moved 2 cats and a parrot 1200 miles easily. Get one of your own."
"11  6, 2013",5th Toyota,"I believe that Toyota missed the boat when they designed the interior. I have a 2013 RAV 4 LE with cloth seats. Seats are uncomfortable. The front seat head rests are as hard as a 2X4. They light grey put cloth on the inside of the door panels where ones hand touches every time the door is opened. I can just imagine what it will look like the first time a greasy auto mechanic opens or closes the door. Every time I make a right turn, I change the radio station or go to Bluetooth. The buttons to control the radio are too close to the outside of the steering wheel."
"10 25, 2013",Toyota - What a Joke,"I purchased my 3rd RAV4 this year in June 2013. Driven over 5,000 miles and Toyota you've totally let me down.
Primary uses: Commuting to work, shuttling kids to activities, going on trips to camp, bike, hike and kayak.

Performance:
The ECO mode is a joke - for my driving (mix of country roads, city and hwy) I get better gas mileage in normal mode. One would think going from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder you would get better gas mileage. NOT! Worse gas mileage than my 2010. You would think they would work to improve it not go the other way.
Responsiveness and performance is sluggish at best. When accelerating to get on the highway, constantly have the RPMs at 4 or 5 ? Never had this issue in my old RAV?s. I also drive my mother?s Subaru Forester which drives and handles extremely better than this RAV in ?normal? mode. If you put it in ECO mode it is even worse. Mode (Sport,Eco) Buttons are not convenient and are a safety hazard to switch to Sport mode for those times I have to accelerate fast to merge onto the highway.

Features:
? Satellite is flaky. In my last RAV it worked like a charm and we really enjoyed it, now it cuts in and out. Dealership told me ?that is just the way Satellite works?. Umm, driving the same routes no I don?t think your answer is correct.
? Bluetooth constantly reboots my phone and is unusable. Again the dealership said can?t be the RAV it?s the phone; tried 3 other phones and still does the same thing. Phone company checked phones (Motorola and LG) and said no issues.
? Like the automated hatch, have not had the problems others seem to mention with piston failure.
? Rearview camera is the bomb.

Exterior Styling:
? Good copy of Mazda and Hyundai and others. No originality. Have gone from leader of the pack to follower.
? Can't believe the paint has mildewed!

Interior Styling:
? TOTALLY miss the storage compartment that was taken away to house the spare tire. Must less functional storage capability. Used this feature a lot in my old RAV to store chairs, purchases, etc.
? Miss the additional plugs behind the console for the rear seat and in the rear of the vehicle.
? Some controls are easy to reach for my short arms, others are hidden or hard to reach.
? Overall feels downgraded.

Value for the Money:
Should have gone with Subaru or Mazda. Looking to trade it in for another vehicle."
"10 23, 2013",Toyota's-all,"I have had several Toyota cars and pickup and they have all been good.

I do wish you had kept the swing door, much easier to open for a women or make all of them with power tailgate"
"10 20, 2013",I'm lovin' it,"I like the feel of the size of RAV, the finish is outstanding , the navigation and the entertainment systems CONS:difficult to read the gauges especially outside temp (passengers like to know the temp as well )Heated seats do not have variable settings."
"10 14, 2013",2014 RAV4 - The Best Car ... so far,"I purchased a Rav4 in March 2013 - I love It! I previously owned a Nissan, and 2 Honda Civics; but so far this is the best. My only concern is I am not seeing the Metallic Green on the color chart;... is it that they are not making it any longer...?"
"10  7, 2013",2013 Toyota Rav4! Fun to drive!,"Hello, having driven a 2005 Nissan Maxima for nearly 9 years and 215K+ miles, it was time to move to a something different. I knew that I was tired of driving a sedan and wanted something with solid gas mileage, stylish, fun to drive yet sat higher up than I was use to. Enter the 2013 Rav4.

What a great little SUV. It's a head turner, believe it or not. Gets great gas mileage, has a smooth ride, is very fun to drive and has lots of room for all types of things. Sorry for the short review, but i highly recommend it."
"10  5, 2013",moving from a Camry to RAV4,"I am enjoying the RAV4, Only one problem and that it is cuts out occasionally so I will have to take it back to a dealer to have that item checked. Dealer Bountiful Toyota, was excellent in every way. Friendly, efficient and wanted to meet my needs in a car."
"09 25, 2013",Broke 6 days after purchase,"This is my third Toyota vehicle.
I had been a long believer of Toyota quality until now.
I had all my maintenance and services done at Toyota on my previous vehicles and have the stamp book to prove it.

It had been less than a week since I purchased my 2013 RAV4 and took it off the lot

I was unloading the trunk when the hatch fell on me.
The right arm holding the hatch came straight off the door and took some paint with it on the way down.

I know I am not the only 2013 RAV4 owner with this issue because there are several online forums that mention this.
I also know there is an updated version of the piston for the hatch available.

I have been in contact with the dealer and Toyota to get the car fixed.The dealer took the defective piston, compressed it, and put it right back onto the hatch.They didn't put the updated pistons on or even a new one.

Toyota also stated that they will not replace the defective piston unless they issue a recall. They said I will have to wait until it breaks again.

The 2013 RAV4 is a nice looking car, but Toyota customer service and quality have fallen a long way."
"09 24, 2013",Fun to Drive,"I was worried about the 4 cylinder, but this car has some spunk. I really enjoy driving it. It has a ""Sport"" button when you want to waste gas and an ""Eco"" button for when you want to save gas. Who could ask for more? Steering feels good, too. I think I made a good decision.

I haven't had it very long, so reliability is based on Toyota's pedigree."
"09 24, 2013",Not Powerful Enough,"The 4-cylinder engine in the new Rav4 is way too small. Why did Toyota do away with the 6? Highway driving is difficult as there's not nearly enough power. The new design also gives this vehicle a very cheap feel. I used to have a 2010 Rav4 with the V6, and this new one is about five steps down! Yes, you will get Toyota reliability, but that's about it. If you liked the wood panneled station wagons in the 80s, then you will love the new Rav4."
"09 23, 2013",This 2014 RAV 4 model is a Flop for Toyota,"My Toyota Sequoia was in the body shop for a minor accident and the rental car service provided me with a 2014 RAV 4 Base Model in black color. The Exterior design is flawless but when it came to the interior design, Toyota lost it big time. I drove this suv for a total of 200+ miles in a couple of days and here is my honest review on it. The front seats are very uncomfortable, hard and short and you want to get out of it after driving 30 minutes. Forget about taking the long interstate trips in this RAV 4. It is also very jumpy and I thought may be the tires are over inflated but I was wrong. The engine noise and road noise is loud and feels like you have a window open somewhere in the suv. Everything you touch inside the cabin feels hard plastic. The middle armrest between the front seats is a joke and Toyota should have done a better job in designing this armrest and more comfortable cushioned seats considering long trips that buyers might take in this suv. The standard rear view camera is a Big Plus. The Eco drive mode did save on the gas. The sports mode is fun to drive only if you do short driving. I was considering buying this 2014 RAV 4 but after my driving experience I say No Thank you ! So if you are interested in buying this 2014 RAV 4, my advice is to go and rent it and drive it around for a couple of days. If you think you still like it then its your choice but don't go to the dealership for a short test drive and then be stuck with it."
"09 22, 2013",Interesting new technology,I recently downgraded from a VW Routan minivan to RAV4. The car is very stylish and still roomy. The Pandora Box and Traffic apps are very interesting. The car is very comfortable and has good pickup. Very easy to park compared to a large minivan. I like the push start instead of a traditional key.
"09 19, 2013",jgolfski,"This vehicle is good looking, economical, and fuel efficient. the limited has the technology that vehicles costing $10,000 more have. One great car!!!"
"09 18, 2013",Rides too harsh!,"Toyota did a very good job on most of this vehicle. I leased a 13 xle and have had the it 6 months now. At first, the ride seemed firm but it starts to wear you out after a period of time. I do a lot of city driving and this vehicle lets you feel and hear everything on the road. It really takes away from an otherwise nice vehicle. The good side is city gas mileage...23-24 good...the exterior, everyone makes nice comments. I have had the vehicle in some nasty storms and it was a trooper. The engine is noisy but plenty of power. The transmission is top notch and the pseudo manual is really good and easy . No problems and that's what i expect from
Toyota, the harsh ride is just too much to take. Thank goodness, i found an excellent seat cushion for it. At the end of the lease, it's going back...too bad, it could have been great. Also, Toyota needs to fix the touch screen. It's easy to operate but in the sun, your on your own. You can't see a thing on it...."
"09 18, 2013",Better Size Engine/MPG than the other SUV's.,"I looked for over 6 months and primarily focused my interest on the Honda CRV because of it's size and style inside. Then when I came across the 2013 new RAV4, there were only two things that caught my eye: 2.5L engine and 30mpg gas. A bigger engine with better gas mileage? Cool! Took the test drive - there are 3 models and two wheelbase sizes 17 inch in the Base and XL model and 18 inch tires for the Limited. I test drove both - the 18 inch drove much smoother (the new car is stocked with Bridgestone tires). I like the drive, the features and room (especially the backseat) of the Limited. However, the engine is an electronic 6 speed that does make a ""wining"" noise when accelerating. The radio drowns it out. The car is fast, good acceleration, good gas mileage and nice interior (it's not real leather - it's a imitation leather, according to the dealership, because it is lighter and more humane than using real leather. Everything about the car is focused on ""lightness."" of all aspects - body, engine, transmission, etc., which all leads to better gas mileage for the bigger engine. Works for me!"
"09 16, 2013",Poor interior design,"Top glove box no door?
front console area only has one side, things fall onto floor,
no auto headlights, can't see display in sunlight,
we purchased an XLE, it came with a sun roof, but you can't get a power seat or leather or interior hatch release.
Mechanically it is Toyota, but the interior design and options are from another world. We tried a limited but that Softex is a poor substitute for leather."
"09 12, 2013",Bigger engine - better gas mileage than other SUVs,"I looked for 6 months for my first SUV; looked at Honda CRV....wanted style, gas mileage, bigger engine and a reasonable price for the model. I test drove the CRV but didn't like the handling or road noise. I had a Toyota Solara for over ten years so I knew about the Toyota quality. I looked at the New RAV 4 and what caught my eye was 1) size of interior ; 2) bigger engine than the CRV (2.5L vs 2.4) but it got better gas mileage! Rides like a car. With the Limited model you get 18-inch, vs 17 -inch tires on the base or XLE model. The engine is a 6 speed electronic that whines a bit. Eco option is a gas saver. Gets approx 24 mpg city. No road noise with the 18 inch tires. A little more with 17 inch. Great back seat space and good storage space in the back...LOVE IT!!"
"09 12, 2013",Short Life!!!!,"We have a 2006 RAV 4 and yes, we have 170,000 miles on it. But it should last for a lot longer. It uses a quart of oil every 600 miles and the transmission has just gone out. We have all the maintenance records with the dealership and drive very, very mildly. We have found blogs on other web sites having the same issues we have so if you want to get a vehicle to last 200,000+ miles, it's not the RAV 4!!!!"
"09  8, 2013",Beautiful SUV,Excellent value for the money. I love the 3 different driving modes and the gas mileage.and the roomy interior. I have the CR-v no comparison .
"09  8, 2013",Crashed,"Just got the RAV4 and had a horrific crash into a semi , whole front , and rt. door torn off . Most people would be dead in this type of crash . All 8 airbags saved them from injury. The RAV 4 saved my family , they walked away from a certain death ."
"09  4, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited,"Toyota hit a homerun with the 2013 RAV4. From the minute I test drove mine I was hooked. I love the comfort of the seats and having ""all"" the controls on the steering wheel cuts down on distractions. It's just a well thought out SUV. I love the NAV system it is very easy to use even for a fifty something guy like me. I bought it and the same day I drove it 300 miles across Texas."
"08 19, 2013",happy with purchase,I'm pleasantly surprised with the mpg I'm getting. I average 32.5 mpg (75% highway). I use the ECO mode only. No problems so far and I currently have 4000 miles. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a reliable awd that drives like a car and gets really impressive gas milage.
"08 15, 2013",Poor Gas Mileage,"We purchased the 2013 two wheel drive Rav4 in July and have put about 2500 miles on it so far. We always drive it in Eco mode and have yet to get anywhere close to the stated mileage for the vehicle. Consistently it is getting 26 mpg (not 31 mpg as stated on the sticker) on the highway (driving 75mph with a/c on). We are careful to accelerate slowly in order to get the best gas mileage we can, but to no avail. In the city, we are getting 22 mpg. There again, we are not making rapid accelerations nor quick stops. My Toyota dealer just says, ""hu"" and has no answers. The only reason we sold our 4Runner, was to get a more efficient car and by going to the Rav4, we have not achieved as much as we had hoped."
"08 11, 2013",excellent fuel economy,"GREAT M.P.G ,after topping off the tank ,took a 105 mile road trip & got a whopping 42 miles per gallon with the eco switch on ......... yes 42 mpg ,with 4 people in the vehicle ...... 105 miles used 2.5 gallons of regular fuel . after topping it off again we used it around town somewhat city driving and retopped to find that we got 34 mpg city . so I did some investgating and found that Toyota wasn't able to check the fuel economy with the eco button on and hadn't any idea what difference it would make . lol THANKS TOYOTA !!"
"08  9, 2013",Best car I've owned yet!,"This car has the best safety ratings and feul economy for small SUVs. It also has great suspension, the car will glide over train tracks. It has comfortable seats and an awesome back up camera.

I received wonderful customer service from Toyota of Murfreesboro, especially Gus who sold me the car. All of the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the car. I would refer anyone there.

Toyota offers a lifetime warrenty on 2013 vehicles, with 2 yr/2400mile maintenace package for free."
"07 27, 2013",Great Car!,"Traded in my Lexus ES for the Rav Limited. Wanted better mileage and more cargo room. Have had car for about 5 months. In ECO get 30 mpg in town, 29 this summer with AC. Have not tried the Sport mode yet.

I like the interior, think the seats are easier to maintain than leather. Interior design works just fine for me, easy controls, apps are great. The Blind Side Monitoring is fantastic, especially when backing out of a parking space. The back up camera screen is great. But I will say, I like the one in my husband's Toyota truck better as the camera screen is on the mirror.

The 2 year free maintenance is a plus as is Toyota reliability. Keyless door locks are so convienient .

One thing I would have liked is an adjustable passenger seat. Small thing I guess but Toyota should have added that, especially on the Limited.

I did test drive a KIA sedan and found it noisy, and cheap feeling. Have had the Lexus RX, IS, ES so that is all I really have to compare the Rav to and I find this car just fine. I like the road feel, being able to see better on all sides, mileage, interior, nice exterior style. Apps work great too, Bluetooth wonderful."
"07 22, 2013",2013 RAV4 Limited AWD is OK with some issues,"We've driven nothing but Toyotas since 1968 (a Corona). For my needs, the ""Limited"" trim package was a good value and worth the cost. The RAV4 replaced a Camry XLE V6. The styling is fine (especially the power rear hatch) and interior room is good. The solid black interior is much nicer than the odd two-tone alernatives. Seat comfort in the driver's seat with the faux-leather is OK thanks to the lumbar support, but the lack of a power passenger seat seems cheap. The NAV system is easy to operate. Overall gas mileage has been better than the EPA estimate. The interior trim (mainly the center console) has too much hard/flimsy cheap-feeling pastic. The 2.5 engine performs well whether in eco or sport mode - I keep the vehicle in eco mode all the time. Overall, I view my new RAV4 as one of the better Toyotas I've owned."
"07  1, 2013",Rav 2013 review,"Just picked up our 2013 Rav Limited last week.
In our 2011 Rav there was a space to the right of the steering wheel where I could keep change.

No outlet in back seat for kids hand held games.

Nav screen to flat should pitch to drivers side.

No power seat on passenger seat.

No real spare tire."
"06 30, 2013",good small SUV,"Good design, good mileage, good price and fun to drive. I got a very good deal from Matia Toyota dealer in Sacramento, CA.
I have been shopping for some many Toyota dealer throughout Ca."
"06 26, 2013",Great Improvement,"Was considering an SUV but never paid much attention to the RAV4. When I saw the 2013 I loved the style and especially the new rear hatch. Some reviewers were concerned about performance, I can tell you there is a distinct difference driving in Sport Mode VS ECO Mode. This one is a true winner, Great Value. The XLE upgrade over the base model is well worth the small cost increase."
"06 15, 2013",New Rav4,"I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage with a 2013 year, I had a 2003 Nissan Altima and could expect at least 30 mpg on the highway. I'm 2 or 3 miles lower with a newer car, maybe it will get better, I hope"
"06  7, 2013",good car,"Great resale value, comfortable, easy to use, good fuel economy, and great sales person (kyle). I recommend this car highly!"
"06  6, 2013",Wonderful Experience at Toyota of Greensburg,"Bought a Rav 4 at Toyota of Greensburg and was treated wonderfully. Zach Guy my sales person and Brian the sales manager gave me a great deal on my trade and a great discount on the new vehicle. If you're thinking of buying a new Toyota stop in at Toyota of Greensburg, you won't be disappointed."
"06  1, 2013",RAV4,Gas milage seems to be very good. The standart back-up camera is extremely helpful when paralel parking. Seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room in the back seats. Ample cargo area. Surprisingly good pick-up when merging onto a highway. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
"05 26, 2013",lack of highway power,"took for a long test drive. city driving was ok, had enough power but when i took it on the highway and put it to the floor it was powerless. didnt have the power to jump over in the passing lane without getting run over. i was very dissapointed since i was ready to purchase. oh well, ill keep looking"
"05  6, 2013",Nice Ride,"Bought a 2013 RAV4 XLE. Just returned from a 600 mile round trip and averaged over 35 MPG traveling 65-70 MPH. It was a quiet, smooth ride. Very Happy with it. The only thing I would like is a more versatile center console that fits a cup with a handle, and maybe a more solid hood. Over rough roads the hood flexes some. It is a minor issue, just an aesthetics type thing. No regrets buying it so far."
"05  6, 2013",First new car for me,"I was looking to replace a 13 year old Toyota Camry. I originally looked at the prius, camry, honda civic, honda insight. I saw the new Rav4 and took it for a drive.

It was comfortable and loved the XLE trim upgrade for only $700. Well worth it.

The Econ mode lets me ge 38 MPG on the highway driving 55MPH on flat roads.

The SUV is extremely comfortable and hold all my gear and can carry my two kayaks on the roof racks.

I love the electronics. Ipod connects both bluetooth and through usb cable.

I love this car. Thinking about buying another one to replace my wifes Honda element."
"05  5, 2013",Best small suv,"The changes made to the 2013 are excellent. I would have bought a Honda CRV if Toyota had not changed the lift gate and spare tire. I waited four months for the RAV4 to get manufactured and delivered to local dealerships. It was worth the wait! I bought the Limited model and love the options that come on that model. I have had the vehicle three weeks and have been getting excellent gas milage. There is nothing that I don't like about the vehicle.

"04 11, 2013",Top Notch Small SUV,"I'm one of those people that need to research everything to the nth degree before I purchase.
I researched and test drove many small SUV's.......

For the price, features, ride quality, performance, and overall bang for the buck you can't beat the newly designed 2013 RAV4.

I honestly could not be happier with my purchase and absolutely enjoy driving this vehicle.
The XLE trim level has the most bang for the buck with many standard features you'd have to either pay more for or purchase the top trim level to get it in other SUV's.

Completely happy with purchase.....you can't go wrong with the 2013 RAV4!"
"04  3, 2013",the best car I ever had,"We bought our first Toyota RAV 4in 2007.....For 5 years we had no problem at all..but we lost IT.in SANDY...and we had no doubts that we should buy again RAV 4,,model of 2013....The car that we had before our first RAV 4_ was Land Rover...and it was not that reliable like TOYOTA .RAV 4...."
"03 20, 2013",First SUV,"I started my purchasing process setting up with a buying service and using an insurance company's recommendations. I had no intention of purchasing a Toyota, in fact I was opposed to the idea. I'm still surprised I purchased one.

I had test driven the Honda CRV, the Mazda CX-5, Ford Edge, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox, Lincoln MKX, Subaru Outback, and Forester.

I needed a car like ride, and room for several suitcases or crates in the back, I wanted AWD, leather heated seats and good MPG. Didn't think I'd get all that.

There are a lot of good choices, I do believe I could have been happy with several of these.
I bought an AWD Limited with no additional options.

the pluses of the RAV4:
* bluetooth, it works flawlessly. Didn't expect to have that standard
*Nice ride, quiet cabin.
* I'm averaging 27 mpg (1500 miles) though I drive aggressively. When driving in eco mode and being mindful of mpg, I can get 31 mpg.
*AWD was perfect for our recent snows. I drove it in 6"" of fresh unplowed snow. It's surefooted.
*keyless entry. . With gloves on in winter it's just so much easier.
*the 2 tone interior looks great.
*great ride, even in the back seats.
*Plenty of leg room for my tall family.

Negs:
*so so stereo. (3 others were far better) I did not get Nav. or the stereo upgrade My previous car had a better stereo. It's 8 yrs old too. A new stereo on their top tier style should sound better.

* The dealers all advertise the seats in the Rav4 Limited as leather. They are NOT. I'd decided on the Rav4 after driving the Honda. That dealer told me the Rav4 seating was a synthetic/leather blend. After researching the Softex I called the salesman on it, he then checked on it and it's synthetic. I felt deceived. I can't believe they don't know it's not leather. I went to 3 dealers and heard the same thing.
(I asked for and received an additional price cut by the dealer, for their mistake.) . I do like the feel of the Softex, and hope it lasts like leather."
"03 18, 2013",Great Car,Keep making Great cars and trucks for generations to come!!! Will have 3 kids needing cars in the next few years
"03  8, 2013",Third Rav4,"We leased a 2006, purchased a 2010 and just got the 2013. The 2006 had a 6 which could make your nose bleed when punching it at a light...whee. All were reliable with no issues. The only complaint(s) are we miss the dual lid on the console storage box, the sliding cover on the upper dash storage shelf and the sunglasses storage in the roof. The backup camera is awesome as is the Bluetooth sync for your phone. We got a little organizer for the console storage and are looking for some kind of box for the open dash shelf. With only 500 miles we are getting better mileage than the 2010."
"03  7, 2013",Happy so far,"Have owned only 3 weeks but am happy with my choice. Was also seriously considering a Honda CRV and looked at several other crossovers (every make has one and they all look about the same). Preferred the RAV4 XLE (FWD, cloth seats) exterior and interior design and the timing chain (vs. CRV's belt which requires major $ to replace at 80,000 miles). Also dealer provided lifetime powertrain warranty at no additional cost. Toyota made some nice improvements on the 2013 model vs. prior ones. Hopefull still one of the most reliable cars made."
"03  5, 2013",First New Vehicle Purchased,"My husband and I took the plunge and bought our first New Vehicle EVER after our beloved Jeep rolled over 200k miles and ceased to be as reliable as we wished. We did a ton of lot shopping and test driving before finally making a deal with the very professional staff at Rouen Toyota in Maumee, OH. Our salesman Byron was top notch and spent a lot of time showing me all of the features of my new Rav4. He was knowledgable, patient, and kind toward our children. I would recommend this dealership, Byron, and our new SUV to everyone. The Rav4 has the fuel economy we'd been lacking and the space we've grown accustomed to with our Jeep and Tundra Pickup. A good price and a zippy vehicle for my everyday commute."
"03  4, 2013",RAV 4 Limited,This car drives and handles much better then Honda CR-V EX-L. Can't go wrong for the price and reliability rating. if your are in compact SUV market consider this car.
"02 28, 2013",Looks like the rest performs like a dog,"A long time Toyota RAV owner and fan, this car was a huge disappointment. All the hype AROUND THE LATE REVEAL...LOOKS LIKE ALL THE REST IN ITS CLASS! Performance....felt like I could run faster and the ""engine sounds and performance says cheap""...not the sticker...very disappointed...will take a look at some others..suggest you do the same and compare before you buy!"
"02 27, 2013",lovin' my new car,"When looking for a new car I knew I wanted a small SUV. I looked at a few different makes and models from other dealerships. I absolutely fell in love with the 2013 Rav4. Just this year they came out with the new Rav4 without the tire on the back of it. It is just a beautiful car inside and out. It might be a small SUV but has a ton of room inside and the back seats even recline! The only thing that they could improve on is the back speakers. They are in the door and its hard to hear anything in the back, other than that, I love everything about it."
"02  9, 2013",Best Looking little SUV.,Reliable SUV. Just right. Smooth ride. Love the new hatch back door. Blessed to own one. Was waiting for Toyota to make pop up back door without the tire on the door. Got one right away.
"01 19, 2013",RAV4 - Much improvement!,"I disagree with the reviewer that removing the 3rd Row option from the RAV4 was a mistake. It was silly to offer such an option in a small SUV - not even a child could fit. I'm sure demand was very low so Toyota made a wise business decission.

I just purchased a 2013 yesterday and I love the new design. I had a 2010 4 Cylinder RAV4 before and have always been happy with the 4 Cylinder. I have driven a V6 in the past and did not see the need for a V6 in this car. I have plenty of power and in the new RAV4, I have Eco and Sport mode.

Hurry out and test drive one. I love my Display Audio and the Bluetooth setup in about 60 seconds."
"12  5, 2023",rav4 very gud,"Overall, the RAV4 is a great car for commuting, families of four, and space. The RAV4 is the best when it comes to reliability. The RAV4 is very spacious in the second row and the trunk and the car offers comfortable seats. The RAV4 gets okay fuel economy but it does do decent in the snow. However there are some things that it lacks. The RAV4's navigation system is very frustrating to use, just use google maps instead. The RAV4's interior quality is not that great either, there are tons of fake buttons and plastic throughout the interior, but no one who buys a RAV4 cares about the interior. The RAV4 has decent styling, but it is not as stylish as the Mazda CX-5. The RAV4 only has 1 engine option, but does not feel underpowered. The RAV4 also doesn't have a very quiet or comfortable ride. Even though the seats are comfortable, the ride is loud and the inside rattles frequently. If you don't care about luxury and want a practical, reliable car, the RAV4 is perfect."
"07 26, 2023",Very Reliable!!,I absolutely am in love with my Rav! The gas mileage is great! I have owned my Rav for years! I just turned over 100000 miles on it. I have not had any big problems with it at all! They don't make cars like this anymore! My RAV is so very reliable!  It also does super great in the snow as well!
"06 28, 2023",THE BEST NEW CAR EVER PURCHASED BY ME!!!,"Owned a silver 2014 Rav 4 XLS for 9+ years now. The best car I have ever owned to date just required to do regular oil and filter changes 2 brake jobs and routine maintenance. Very good on gas consumption compared to my GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherooke!"
"07 15, 2022",Not recommend for anybody,My stereo system keep showing loading signals and then blackout. It’s completely not working. Called Toyota made a complaint and no solution. Lots people having the same issue. They have to have a recall on that. Worst customer service in Toyota. I will never buy it. I will not recommend Toyota to anybody either
"03  3, 2022",Toyota RAV4 2014,"Best cat I've ever had almost up to 450,000 Kilometres and have had no problems. It's never broke down and the Sports mode is a Beast."
"04  8, 2021",Toyota is for everv and reasonable price,It’s a good car reliable comfort easy to use and drive trustable  smooth spacious three option of speed and low gas consumtion per hundred mile.
"03 31, 2021",Best car I've owned since 1982,This car is simply fabulous in every way!!!!! :)  I feel safe and comfortable and I finally have a radio that works! Could not be happier.
"09 14, 2020",Very fast,I love my car it the ride fit for mi and my family and is good in gas too and very comfortable nice in side
"08 18, 2020",The best car I've owned.,"Toyota RAV4 is a very good compact SUV, and it's easy to see why it's one of the best-selling nameplates in the United States. It delivers impressive fuel economy and comes loaded with plenty of standard features. This Toyota also has an upscale, roomy interior."
"07 19, 2020",Nicest used Cari have ever owned.,This car net all my needs. As a tall-ish guy this car offered a lot of interior room and leg space. It has great gas mileage and handles nicely.
"07 14, 2020",Once I go back  home for good I will buy the same!,"This car was very good for me. I need to sell it Because I'm going back home for good. I will buy the same car for sure!
Money saver.. only 4 cylinder!"
"03  4, 2020",Great value in a sport ute,"Styling, comfort and reliability fully met Toyota expectations.  Fuel economy is a bit less than hoped, but security of 4x4 drive in severe Winter conditions worthwhile.  It’s everything from a grocery getter to regular commuter.  Even gets occasional light duty off-road use on fishing and hunting trips."
"02 27, 2020",Never Letting this one go!!,"I got my 2014 in late 2017 as I was in the process of a divorce and working 2 jobs. Traded in my 2012 Corolla for this. The Vechile is now 6 years old and the suspension and steering still feel like brand new, mine is a base model LE with a Sport and Eco Mode. The Eco Mode on mine I find to limiting, (best if you’re going on a long trip with a low speed limit not during Rush hour at best.) Sport Mode on the other hand is a dream come true driving. The Interior after helping my mom boy her ‘13, my ex-husband buy a ‘15 and my best friend buy a ‘17 does feel a bit on the cheaply made side.  But apart from that it’s wonderful! My Rav has AWD, Traction control, and (thankfully it became standard) a backup camera."
"01 29, 2020",Great vehicle,Great vehicle with lots of room. It is easy to drive and handle. Has lots of room in back for wheelchair or other needed items.
"01 28, 2020",Third RAV4 in the family,"Just purchased a used '11 RAV4 for our daughter to join the '04 and '14 RAV4s already in the family. Great reliability, good gas mileage, compact/easy to maneuver and park, good safety...what's not to like. Because I'm a large guy, slightly bigger seats would be nice, but hardly a show-stopper. Also, I really enjoy all of the additional ""luxury"" items included in my '14 Limited edition, e.g., AWD, blind side monitor, back-up camera, XM radio, heated seats, bluetooth, auto headlights."
"01 21, 2020",2014 RAV radio issues,"My 2014 Rav 4 stereo just went out!!  The bluetooth began to kick on and off a few days ago,  I thought is was issues with my phone."
"01  8, 2020",Meet my expectation in every way,"I owned this car since 2014. The front seat at least for a smaller person (5'6"") is comfy, though an adjustable lumbar support would make the seat better.Engine power is enough to easily get up to speed on most interstate ramps.  Gas mileage is not better than advertised except on long flat runs in the mid 60 mph range, then I get 35mpg or better.  This car has very usable load room. I had many long trips with family and it's best car."
"01  5, 2020","Attractive, functional, reliable, affordable",The perfect car for getting around town comfortably.  Comfortable ride and lots of room inside.  Brand new tires and battery.  Very solid gas mileage and handles great city or highway.
"12 21, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,This car met all my needs. I absolutely love it. It is beautiful on the inside and outside. I am so glad I chose a Rav4.
"11 25, 2019",Good investment for 30k,"This car is reliable, durable, well made for small family or single person. Trunk space is adequate. Features plentiful. The car handles well in highway traffic. Gears change smoothly. Ride is comfortable. One car seat is goid and two would be capacity."
"11 21, 2019",Great all purpose vehicle,"Excellent suspension and road compatibility.  Easy to handle and delivers a smooth, comfortable ride. My wife especially loves the RAV feeling very safe while driving it."
"11  4, 2019",Love the  performance o and reliability of Toyotas,Thi vehicle is not new to us. We just upgraded from a 2009 to a 2014 in the same color etc. We like the reliability.
"10 27, 2019",Excellent Value,This car is very nice and comfortable. For the value you can’t find a better car like RAV4. They are reliable and make a great family vehicle.
"09 27, 2019",Versatile and Reliable,"Full disclosure:  I used to sell Toyota, Buick, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks.  For my money, Toyota offers extreme reliability at a reasonable cost. My 3014 RAV4 was Toyota Certified with 35,000 miles on the odometer.  Two and a half years later the RAV4 has 90,000 plus miles. The SUV still runs and looks like new. I have done only routine maintenance, replaced original equipment tires with Michelins and replaced the radio with a Kenwood model that featured Apple CarPlay. This RAV4 was as close to a good investment as any car or truck I ever purchased."
"06 10, 2019",5 years never any mechanical issues. Great car!,"I am a big guy. This car is very comfortable to drive with plenty of legroom. Family loves it for long trips to the mountains and beach.  Also plenty of room in the trunk for all my families grocery, toys and if you need even more room like bringing home 20 bags of bark from the garden supply store just make rear seat flat."
"05 20, 2019",It’s Toyota got to be reliable! Enjoying the Ride,"This car meets our needs very reliable comfortable ride ! Great on gas, would recommend same vehicle to friends and family . For a used vehicle and of course a Toyota you know your getting a great car. The 2014 Rav 4 is great and it was a one owner car well taken car of we are now a Toyota family along with my Tundra. Looking to purchase another Tundra or Tacoma soon and passing my used Tundra down to my son."
"04 13, 2019",best car i vere owned,this car meets our need good leg room good gas mileage lots of power rear seats lay down for extra cargo space sun roof towing package if you need it
"04  8, 2019",Very nice vehicle I love it,This vehicle was just what I was looking for. I have owned Volvo’s  this vehicle is just as nice and very easy to drive  love it
"03 27, 2019",Great vehicle,"Plenty of room, easy to get in and out of.  Seats are comfortable.  Love the back up camera, the Bluetooth feature easy to handle and good on gas"
"02  9, 2019",Things gone bad,Radio quit working after warranty expired.  Car was less than 3 years old.  Toyota is not standing by their product and won't replace it even though this is a common problem.  Now transmission fluid is leaking.  Car is a lemon!
"01 30, 2019",Pontiac vibe,You cannot go wrong with the Toyota engine very dependable good on gas all wheel drive is the way to go with the 1.8 engine
"01  9, 2019",I like RAV4 limited owsam. Car I like everything,Really good family car  it has all the features that we need to make our life luxury  plus previous owner installed Remot Startar  i recommend everyone one to buy limited rav4
"01  2, 2019",Toyota reliability is nearly unmatched,"I purchased this vehicle to be my personal take me to the mountains, rivers, golf course, etc.  It has been totally reliable and given good comfort doing it.  On long trips I get better than advertised gas mileage."
"12 23, 2018",Disappointing!,"Too many issues...been serviced only at  Griffin ...radio/stereo quit working and all door locks do not work!!  Only 41,000 miles!!!!  Very dissatisfied and disappointed in problems and cost to tepair issues that should have not even been an issue with such a new car!!!"
"12  5, 2018",Lots of road noise,When we drove it a little sluggish when asked to get up to freeway speed and enough road noise anyone in the back seat couldn't hear.
"11 27, 2018",coolest most reliable car I have owned !!!,I needed a car that was AWD and simple - this rides on the snow like a snow mobile especially if you add snow tires...gas mileage is great and style is perfect for me !!! I love em' so much I bought a second !!!
"11  4, 2018",Most best value car i ever owned,This car exhibited all my needs. One of the best value price car. Design is really great. Very comfortable car. Most successful car from Toyota for the reasonable price
"10 15, 2018",reliable and lots of room,"This vehicle has definitely met my needs being roomy, all wheel drive and I am able to use the racks on top for transporting my kayaks  and by the way, I love the color."
"10  2, 2018",Can't compare to any other small SUV,"We looked for several other cars before getting this RAV4. We compared to a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and Honda CRX. But none of those cars compares to our Toyota. We love how smooth it is to drive, how fuel efficient it is, the cargo space has no comparison and even though we own an LE (lowest trim), the interior is very comfortable, and it has almost every accommodation that the competitors' mid trims have (except the automatic lights)"
"08  8, 2018",A nice and reliable car to own,It is really good for me with all my needs. I will buy the newest model to have the best and latest accessories every one is longing for.
"07 18, 2018",Zippy dependable commuter and traveling vehicle.,Owned the car for four years.  I love how it handles and quickly accelerates.  The ride could be smoother and quieter.  I never had to take it to the shop for anything other than maintenance.
"06 27, 2018","Easy to buy, own, resell","On second RAV4. Great mileage for an SUV non-hybrid. Excellent acceleration in Economy mode, never mind Sport. Roomy enough for four adults . Lots of storage."
"06 23, 2018",We are a Toyota Family,This was an easy choice.  Toyota is a great brand and we know we can always count on the car!!  Thanks for being there for the family.
"06 22, 2018",Versatility is the best of all cars owned.,"This car has usability that prior cars could never equal, with the rear seats being able to push all the way down flat. This allows extending the cargo area enough to carry items most cars would not be able to. Yet, it's smaller in length, so it fits nicely into smaller spaces."
"06  4, 2018",Most comfortable Automobile I have owned.,"I found myself in need of a vehicle that will perform well in snow due to job location change.
The Rav4 has exceeding my expectations for comfort and has performed very well in snow.
My job is at one of the higher elevations and at the top of the hill...I see many vehicles sliding
when it snows and I have had no problem at all."
"05 30, 2018",Disappointed but I don?t hate the car,I wish I shopped around more and looked and more cars in the same class. It took me a little while and I started to find this this car really lacked!
"05 26, 2018",Most reliable car ever,This car makes me drive like a boss as I just stated my own business I would like to have this rav4 do that I can never worry about breakdowns
"05 24, 2018",Great suv,The RAV4 is a great suv. I bought it because I needed a bigger car than my Camry when I got a dog and bought a house. The 75lb pup has room and I have room for transporting yard clean up to the dump. Because of my raves about this car 2 of my friends are now happy RAV4 owners.
"05 19, 2018",Love my Rav4,"Great cargo space. Love the backup camera, steering wheel controls for audio and bluetooth. Deep cup holders so bottles won't rattle around and plenty of storage for all the things I keep in the car. Bought it at a great dealership - A1 Toyota in New Haven CT. Wouldn't shop anywhere else."
"05 16, 2018",Best car i have ever driven.,This car is reliable and comfortable to drive. It holds its value and feels very safe driving in the winter weather. Only car I will ever own.
"05  3, 2018",I have always wanted to own one.,"Overall I am pleased. Improvements could be made on quality of interior. A storage compartment on the dash for a cell phone or transponder. Also, better floor mats."
"04 21, 2018",I got exactly what I was told i will be getting.,The vehicle was in excellent condition and the price was also less than average market value. Due to the low price i did not even had to bargain
"03 30, 2018",Love my RAV,"My sister recommended the RAV and I really like mine.  I've driven it almost 100,000 km since 2015 and would definitely buy another one.  Gas mileage is great with my 4 cylinder engine.  No blind spots when you change lanes compared to my Ford Escape.  Never had one issue with it in the 3 years I've owned it."
"03 21, 2018",We're on our 2nd Rav4 and most likely to #3?,The Rav4 is the perfect vehicle for us. There's plenty room for whatever you do. The rear seats fold down for even more cargo space. Dependability is just another reason we love our Toyota.
"03 20, 2018","I love Toyota, and I especially love my 2014 Rav4","The Rav4 is well priced for its comfort, options and performance.  It drives and handles like a much more expensive vehicle, is super dependable and a very comfortable ride."
"03  7, 2018",Review of 2014 Toyota RAV4,"Would prefer armrests for long driving.  - Hoped I would get 30 mpg on long trips. Am near but not quite able to accomplish that yet. - Very comfortable for long periods in car.  Car suspension system especially comfortable.  - Have added a hitch, crossbars for roof rack, fog lights to increase usefulness of this car.  Wish seats would fold forward completely to leave a flat surface in the back of the car.  As it is there is a slight incline where the seats fall forward. -  All driving apparatus near at hand and their use is not difficult to grasp for the first-time driver.  Wish car's odometer would always show (it doesn't) when looking for other available readings such as current mpg, average mpg, Trip A, Trip B, etc.  - Am a hard marker so I think the 4 stars I have given is a very high rating for the car.    5 Stars might have been given but for the exceptions mentioned above."
"03  1, 2018",Adore my Rav 4,"Perfect size, great features, drives like a dream and is very comfortable. So glad I found this vehicle. It?s perfect! Even used its rock solid."
"02 27, 2018",Very smooth ride.,"I have only owned this vehicle for a few weeks but so far I love it. It rides smooth and has a sleek design.
If I were to have recommended an improvement it would be to improve the quality of the interior."
"02 13, 2018",Beautiful Car,I love this car. It is so nice inside and out. I bought it used and it has held up its value vary nicely. I would buy it again.
"02  7, 2018",Not the most reliable,"I've driven this car for three years now, we are at 85,000 km and the transmission is now failing. Any one having the same problem?"
"02  2, 2018",I love my RAV4,RAV4 is a great car for travel and to cruise around town. It is spacious and comfortable and I am enjoying every bit of it.
"01 31, 2018",I love RAV-4 Toyota,"It is confortable, cute, economic. And is perfect for women like me. It is not expensive and  I can fell sure driving far away or I. Express way for it estabity."
"01 29, 2018",Multi functional car.,The rav is zippy around town and gets 22 mpg as rated.  The all wheel drive works great in the snow.  I can haul a six foot step ladder with the rear seats down.  Tall adults can ride comfortably in the back seat.  I have gotten 31mpg on the highway.
"01 17, 2018",Very reliable car.,"I very seldom drive it, my wife drives the majority of the time. The size of the vehicle is much easier for to drive. Previously owned a GMC Acadia she didn't like the vehicle to big."
"01  9, 2018",Best Car Ever!!!,I had wanted a Rav 4 for a long time and now that I have one I am not disappointed!  This car handles the road well under any conditions.  I am very happy with the 29 mpg it gets.  It is very comfortable for long distance trips  both front and back with lots of leg room.  It has a spacious cargo area that I use constantly.  The interior feels very luxurious especially with all the features that came on this model.  When it is time for a new vehicle I will definitely get another Toyota Rav 4!
"12 30, 2017",LOVE my RAV 4's!!!,"Just upgraded to this vehicle....I've owned 2 others and never looked back! Excellent performance & handling, roomy, comfortable and safe for my 16 year old daughter to drive!!"
"12 28, 2017",this rav 4 has nore room inside than you think,"the rav4 is great on gas for being a awd car it has comfortable room for someone who is 6'5  and i have alot of leg room and for people in the back seats it has alot of room as well ,and when you put the seats down you haul a good amount of things as well"
"12 11, 2017",Great Car,This car met my needs.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and the back.  It rides nice and goes great in the snow.  I'm really enjoying the car.
"12  1, 2017",Love this car!,We purchased this car in October and it is great. It was a great value relative to other comparable? vehicles and we love it.
"11 29, 2017",RAV4 owner,"I purchased this car almost a year ago, after having an older model RAV4.  I love love love this car."
"11 11, 2017",the most reliable car i have owned is the one i'm,i like it because it's good on gas. it's comfortable all the way around. we go on long rides now and i don't have to get out half way threw the trip.
"11 10, 2017",AMAZING,Just bought one it is gorgeous. Cannot wait to drive my new car!!!!! The sunroof is an awesome buying feature!
"11 10, 2017",Great relialablity,Great driving enjoy the heated seats and sun roof. Electric rear hatch is easy to use and very useful.
"11 10, 2017",2012 and older were built much better,Car is just okay very disappointed after owning a 2012 rave 4 quality was sacrificed for cheaper plastics to get more fuel mileage
"11  2, 2017",My first smaller car,It met all my needs. I got good gas mileage with it. I had no problems and service was great. They did all the paper work when I bought the car.
"11  2, 2017","I leased this car new, liked it so  I bought it.","Easy to drive, easy to park. Service was great. the only problem I had was when I bought it at the end of my lease I had to wait about 5 weeks to get my title to register the after I had paid for it in full"
"10 24, 2017",Relability+,Great highway vehicle. Great fuel economy coupled with plenty of engine power. Enough goodies to make the vehicle enjoyable.
"10 22, 2017",Love my Rav4,"We love this car.  Runs great, good gas mileage and dependable.  Lots of room.  Love the back seat laying down so we can carry things.  Would recommend."
"10 21, 2017",my first car,The car met all of my needs.  It is very comfortable for me. I am driving every day to my work and bask.
"10 21, 2017",Love my RAV4!',"This car is better than I expected! Meets all my needs and is a pleasure to drive. Highly recommended to family and friends. Dealership New Country Toyota, Westport CT, and especially Nick (sales) and Jessica (service)"
"10 11, 2017",Most reliable SUV on the market.,Most reliable SUV on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"09 16, 2017",Great AWD small SUV,"We wanted an AWD, small SUV with decent gas mileage and great reliability. This car checks all the boxes! We owned a Subaru Forrester in the past; it was good but not quite as reliable."
"09 10, 2017",Best alround car on the market,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)"
"09  6, 2017",Love all the safety options,I love the way this vehicle handles. It is very cost efficient with great fuel mileage. Love the roominess in the inside for a small SUV.
"09  6, 2017","RAV4 Limited -AWD, xtra security features, loaded!",Excellent reliable and top model car with technology package included.  Hard to find Limited models with the technology package and blizzard pearl exterior with two tone interior: black/cinnamon.
"09  3, 2017",Great small SUV,"Love this car, plenty of room, power when needed and good on fuel. I've owned several Toyota's and I like this one the most."
"08 29, 2017",So far so good,"I haven't owned the car long, but it has been a good car so far. I would recommend it to people looking for a good midsize vehicle."
"08 29, 2017",Really good suv,I think that's one of the best and most reliable car I've ever owned. I really like it. Never had any issues with it.
"08 22, 2017",Couldn't be happier with my choice,"This car fits all of my needs. The back seat offers great leg room suitable for my in-laws who are over 6ft tall. The dual-zone climate control is a great feature that is included in the XLE. Backup cameras come standard and are super helpful for safety and parallel parking. I feel so safe in this vehicle and have no worries when my wife drives to work. The seats can wear you down a little bit on road trips over 3 hours long. However, once you find the way you like the seat you won't have a problem; it took me one trip to figure out just how to adjust the seat to make it fit my needs perfectly. You won't regret buying this vehicle. Another plus is that you can get fuel economy of 30+ mpg on highway driving!"
"08 10, 2017",Rideshare customers love this vehicle,"As a senior citizen, this  vehicle and all the items I was looking for in a new car including  rear camera, side mirror turn signal's, plenty of cupholders, fog lamps.  Unfortunately, hybrid technology was not available in the RAV 4 in 2014.  Rideshare customers love the roominess and comfort of the vehicle, and so do I."
"08  7, 2017",I love this car!!!!!,This was the best car for me. I'm so happy I used the service to find the most ideal vehicle for me. I found everything I wanted in the car. Thank you thank you thank you!!!
"08  7, 2017",RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION,"YOU CANT BEAT A TOYOTA FOR ALL AROUND QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I ONLY FILLED UP THE GAS TANK EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND I DROVE AROUND A LOT."
"08  5, 2017",Love my Rav4,"I just purchased my Rav4 this week.  So far I couldn't ask for a better vehicle.  It is roomy, comfortable, smooth riding and just all around perfect for me."
"08  4, 2017",Love my Rav4!!,"I've just had it a few days, but I love it!!  I have been wanting one for a long time.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  Can't wait to travel with it."
"08  3, 2017","Spacious, sporty and fun","We test drove three different cars before landing on our RAV4. We chose it because of the options of Eco Mode and Sport Mode for driving, the AWD capabilities, the absolute comfort both front and back, the look, the interior, and of course the Toyota brand! So happy to have a Toyota back in my life!"
"08  3, 2017",Sound system computer died,I am very disappointed.  I had my car less than 5 months and the radio system went out and I was told I would have to pay 800 for a new one.
"08  3, 2017",Go For The Limited,"Love the drivability of the RAV4. Once I found one with a black exterior & then experienced the interior of a Limited trim level, it was all over. I knew I had found the perfect car for me."
"07 31, 2017",Most Stylish Car I've Owned,"I have driven RAV4s before, but never one this stylish. The interior has 2-tone softex leather-trimmed seats that are not only the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but also a thing of beauty!!! It handles incredibly well and, even though it is 3 years old, it looks and handles like a brand new car. Toyota's are the best!"
"07 28, 2017",Very fun to drice,"Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love it. It drives very well and has been very reliable so far. I really like the interior design"
"07 28, 2017",Sit back and enjoy the ride,Great features on the interior. Loved the power seats that were also heated seats. 2nd row seat that reclines. Perfect size for everyday commute.
"07 24, 2017",Best car to upgrade to!,"This car is the ultimate vehicle - lots of space/leg room, great mpg for an SUV, just overall the best car I've ever owned! Highly recommend the RAV4 to anyone looking for a new car, you will not be disappointed!"
"07 23, 2017",Has power,This vehicle has power and keeps it's value. It is a Toyota by the way.  Lots of cup holders!   Very cute Suv and very reliable
"07 13, 2017",It's a Toyota!,"This is my second RAV4 and fifth Toyota overall. First RAV4 (2009) I put over 120K on it with only routine maintenance and two sets of tires. Traded for a Subaru Impreza hatchback but was not happy with it (to small). Traded Subaru for 2014 RAV4 love the looks and the size very happy, I will never own anything but Toyota! Keep up routine maintenance and Toyota will last forever."
"07  2, 2017","New owner, a leased vehicle 2 years old. Used.",",Still getting used to it, my immediate negatives were lack of storage spaces around the cabin and arm resting places while driving.  Visually there are more blind spots than I am used to, but I say that is more my adjustment than the car.  Road noise is sort of  loud, but I hit a different patch of concrete and total silence.  Is it tires or something else?  I don't have a complaint about zippy, cuz the car will adjust to your desire. I had a Montero Sport 6 cyl with the same HP and had to drive  1200 Lbs more. Positives.  I like the Blue tooth,  radio controls on the steering column.  The fuel consumption meters, backup camera, and the SPACE OVERALL. One other thing is the dash trim has a reflective surface with the sun, sort of a chrome shine."
"06 23, 2017",Love it,"The Rav4 drives smoothly, is very comfortable and has awesome features. I would highly recommend it."
"06 15, 2017",my little dream suv,"Love the whole pkg...from color to size, comfort, gas mileage. sporty looking . The Interior being black and brown called Terracotta sealed my love for it."
"06 12, 2017",Great Reliable SUV at a great price,"I'm a tall fellow at 6'4"" and the Rav4 LE fits me just fine. The right console is designed just right so my knee can rest comfortably. The Safety features are great, as is the gas mileage for an SUV. The only cons that I've found so far is there is some road noise over rough surfaces and the lack of android auto/ability to show google maps on the LED screen for navigation."
"06  3, 2017",Nice interior and exterior plus reliable,I really like  toyota Rav4. It is nice exterior and nice interior even though some are disappoint me.
"05 31, 2017",Toyotas most reliable the only cars i buy,I love my RAV4 XLE  I am comfortable and its just the right size. I wish it had GPS and an alert signal for when I am going to change lanes.
"05 31, 2017",Very reliable stylish car,Very reliable stylish car. Excellent coverage under Toyota care. The car is very comfortable and spacious and suitable for road trips as it is good on mileage.
"05 30, 2017",2013 RAV4 XLE,"The RAV4 XLE is a great value for the money. Looking for a smaller SUV, this is it.  2013 and newer has so many more options, from Bluetooth to a backup camera."
"05 23, 2017",comfortable and sleek looking,"So far, love this car.
 Cars.com had a great variety in my area. Response was immediate.Dealer was informative and helpful. Made the purchase easy."
"05 23, 2017",Great styling and reliability,Reliable vehicle with spacious and well laid out interior. Good gas mileage. Put a hitch on it and planning to tow a small boat and installed bike rack.  Great family car.
"05 21, 2017",So far so good,Just what my wife needed! Easy to get in and out of! Plenty of room for grandkids and gardening hobby.....
"05 17, 2017",I am loving my choice!,"I was able to test drive three vehicles and purchased the Toyota Rav4 XLE! Love this vehicle! It handles well, very comfortable, nice interior and great on gas.  The navigation and bluetooth ability is definitely a plus! The ECO or Sport mode option when driving is excellent! One of my better decisions in purchasing a vehicle."
"05  3, 2017",Great car for the money,"I've only had this car for a little bit but so far it's been great.  Great on gas for a crossover SUV, looks sharp, handles well and has that Toyota reliability!  A lot more spacious than it looks from the outside.  The AWD will be handy once winter hits again in here in the midwest.  It is a quiet ride also!  Great little car all around.  So far so good."
"04 24, 2017",Somewhat disappointed,"I leased a standard model RAV4 three years ago, and when deciding whether to take the car I was bothered by dumb changes they have made to the interior, plus I wasn't thrilled with the exterior design either. And today I feel the same way. For instance, they moved the cup holders so that one is under the dash making it hard to get out. There is no longer a tray in the mid-seat compartment. There is still a compartment over the glove box, but they omitted the door that would go over it. There is no light over the front cup holder and adjacent areas. To turn on the overhead lights you have to feel around for a switch instead of just tapping on the light as before. Etc. All pretty annoying if you've owned an earlier RAV4. Door keys on the earlier model design you could easily feel the buttons, whereas the new style you cannot. I'm not crazy about the lift-up rear door, but that's just me. These things still annoy me after three years of having the car, so much so that I'm thinking of trading down to an earlier model. Performance is good, including the new transmission. It's still a good vehicle, I just think they made some real mistakes in the design. I would have given the car higher reliability rating if I had not had to do a near-complete brake job a few days ago."
"04 22, 2017",Navigation screen,I own a 2014 rav4 limitted. After 2 years of using the nav screen keeps on rebooting. When i went to toyota to have it fix but the cust service said that they cant fix the screen because it is not a toyota product I was so disappointed. My vehicle is out of warranty and im willing to pay for repair.  I will never go for toyota again.
"04 11, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,me and my family  love this car because Toyota is great. Thats why we love the rav4. It is really good for children
"04  1, 2017",Decent car,I had this car for three years. The road noise was loud but it drove really well in the snow!  Overall it was a good car but my family needed something bigger
"03 24, 2017","Excellent aerodinamic, economic in gas","Good I recommend it. If you can afford a hybrid, get it. very good in gas, excellent in sport mode if you wanna get away fast. The entertainment system is not good, cheap, a pain to upgrade, and only navigation in full loaded."
"03 10, 2017",RAV4 Limited,"I love this vehicle though I am open-minded. I am on the lookout for a similar/different vehicle that is very reliable, comfortable and has economical gas consumption."
"03  7, 2017",I had a RAV4 for 10 years. I love this one too,I had a 2006 RAV4 and then went to a Camry for the last year and a half. It was so low to the ground and just wasn't me. I love the room and comfort of the RAV4
"02 10, 2017",Toyota Rav 4 2014,Bought my rav 4 brand new in 2014 jan.1 year later i noticed colour change in my moulding looking like burnt patches.Filled a claim with Toyota which they declined to replace and told me i will have to pay for it.Now we are in 2017 the patches have continue to increase.Six months ago my radio just stopped working again i went to Toyota and reported all they said was i need to replace a new radio.It keeps reloading then goes off again and again.I have noticed this is a common problem with toyota.I am a very dissatisfied and disappointed customer.Am still paying for car.
"01  9, 2017",Radio Issues,My radio recently went out on my Toyota Rav 4. I haven't even owned  the vehicle for three years. I am over on miles so the warranty is void. The dealership wants 1200 dollars to replace my existing radio with a refurbished radio. I have checked the internet and this seems to be a defect with the system.
"12 19, 2016",2014 Red Toyota Rav4 LE,I bought my Toyota Rav4 as a certified Pre-Owned and it never disappointed me. The car is very smooth and definitely recommend to others.
"10 23, 2016",It's not a Porsche,"Awesome car for the money. If you are looking for top of the line quality leather, and you can't live without another cup holder, buy a Lexus. If you need speed,  buy a Porsche.  If you want style, and want to look like you know what you're spong, buy this Rav 4. And stop borrowing your grandmother's Buick!"
"09  1, 2016",Radio/Bluetooth,Have had my 2014 Toyota RAV 4 into the dealership 3 times with radio/bluetooth problems and it is still not fixed. The first time the radio was stuck on a station and I could not control volumn. Took it to dealership and they said it was a computer upgrade. Picked up the car and then the blue tooth was not working and constantly flashes connect/disconnect they said they fixed it again. Picked it up and still not working so took it back to dealer and they say they will replace the entire radio. Get it back with the new radio and still not working. Now they will not call me back to get it in again and it will be a week tomorrow since I picked it up and called them on 8/27/2016 saying it is still not working. Besides this problem they sold me a clear coat on the paint and scotch guard for inside and it seems like the paint chips even worse than any other car I've ever owned. The ride is not smooth and feels like you're in a truck when you go over bumps. I bought the car new in 2014 but I probably won't be hanging onto it for much longer.
"01  2, 2016",Rav4 a good bet,"I was shopping at end of year for 2013-2014 AWD vehicle with hatchback. I test drove the Subaru Outback , Toyota Rav4 Limited, Ford Escape SE and Titanius and Honda CRV touring. For the money and features the Toyota was the best buy. I will say the Honda was the smoothest ride and the Ford had the best engine performance. The Toyota was in-between these two for performance and comfort. The sport mode did give it better performance and the eco mode is nice for basic driving. Subaru Outback was not as good driving and I was surprised. Looking at the XLE and Limited in my view the Limited is worth it (~2-3K more on the used model). The limited has better seats and comfort. Also just more stand items included. Some have complained on the Bluetooth system. It works with my iphone 5 just fine and the dealer showed me a few tricks. The nav system is not the greatest, but not a big deal for me. since I like to use my phone anyway (included with limited so I have it). The interior lighting is a bit for for the switches but not a show stopper.

Things I really liked were visibility, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, drivers seat adjustments., AWD, handling and overall power."
"10  8, 2015",i hate this piece,I rented this car and I was NOT impressed. Everyone was saying the same thing.. S it has backseat recliners wow.. I would buy the Ford Escape or the X Trail or the CRV or something else I can't believe I rented this... I hate Toyota cars because they are extremely boring and timeless...Their parts are expensive and the don't last as long as you think
"09 30, 2015",2014 rav 4,Never enjoyed a day with my 2014 rav 4. So regretted buying it. The ride is the worst I have ever experienced causing my central nervous system to take a hit. Toyota says thats how they are built.
"09 25, 2015","Great vehicle, overall","I own a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD. Pros: Stable, comfortable ride with a relatively smooth and well-behaved 6-speed automatic transmission. Back-up camera is fantastic. Rear leg room is massive, especially compared to a sedan of equal length. The rear seats recline, which is great. The heated seats are phenomenal. The AWD system, brakes, and traction control make this vehicle feel extremely steady in poor, wintery conditions. It surprised me how well it all works. Cons: Cheap plastic around shifter lever. Rear styling is weird. The tail lights are odd-looking, and the button to release the rear hatch is far too high. Engine is very weak. I would have bought a V6 if it were still available. Overall, it's a great little SUV. It has a good balance of utility, size, and car-like handling. Just don't buy this vehicle if you're looking for something exciting to drive. It's not for people who value performance."
"09 16, 2015",Overated but Good Space and MPG,"Pros:
Nice Cargo Space for Mini SUV.
Good MPG.
Fairly quiet ride.

Cons:
Blind Spots due to High Metal doors and tailgate. Very Loud Interior Rumble when back windows are open. Uncomfortable seat after one hour of driving. Lack of true recreation assistance features. Lightweight aluminum doors dent very easily. Tailpipe and muffler hang down like they forgot to plan for it. No way to tie down tailgate when transporting large items with tailgate open. No way to shut off annoying beeper when tailgate is open. Tiny tiny arm rest storage box. Integrated voice calling and stereo need improvement.

Summary
A bit disappointed. I would not purchase a RAV4 again."
"08 31, 2015",terrible interioal finish,Just want to let every one knows rav4 has terrible and unacceptable defects in the interioal finish. to look at the joint between windshield and top and you can see how rough the job they have done.that is really unacceptable!!!!!!! looks just like junk !!! not understand why they made rav4 like this. I checked other cars there is no one make this joint like rav4
"08 17, 2015",Excellant car,"Lots of Space, great gas mileage, dependable, good dealer network. The wind noise very noticeable at freeway speeds specially when going over 75mph. But good outward visibility, smooth breaking, and powertrain is smooth and efficient"
"07  1, 2015",Unrepairable Air conditioner (AC),"Car is beautiful over all,
but it has stinky Air conditioner. And Toyota refuse to fix it under warranty. IT costs about 160$ every 3-4 months to have it deodorizer and change cabin filter."
"04  7, 2015",rav 4 negatives,"I purchased a 2014 rav4 on Nov 3, 2014. The xle model is great looking but not knowing the rating on the vehicle I did purchase the full 5yr 100,000 extra warraty. Now for the negatives as follows:
1. The speed indicator is off a solid two miles an hour and I hope I don't get a speeding ticket.
2. Too much glare on the screen in middle of dash.
3. This one makes me balistic - The bluetooth system really sucks, sucks, and sucks some more. I had it to the dealer and he said my problem is the brand of phone I have-bull ! I have a 2013 Chevy Silverado and the phone works the was it should on the bluetooth system so it's not my phone. This is how bad it is - When I receive a call after around two minutes the connectivety is lost and will not return until I pull off the road and shut the car off and wait two minutes and restart the car and then it returns. I don't care what brand of car from the most costly to the least that's just plain discusting. I was looking at a Chevy Equinox and only if I would have know I would be driving one. I will never buy another new car without test driving the bluetooth.
4. The dealer has the unliest dealer stickers ever that they put on the car and I just had to remove it."
"02 20, 2015",Lynch Toyota Manchester Ct,"I recently bought a 2014 Rav 4 LTD,
on the day I was picking up my Rav 4, Eduardo explained in great detail how to use Auto High Beam, Lane Departure Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and plus Entune Premium JBL Audio with Navigation Multimedia App Suite, and connecting my I Phone including my address book and music.
Yesterday had a problem with my music not connected, called and Eduardo was on a trip to New York, he called later in the afternoon, set up appointment in the evening and this problem was corrected in 5 minuets.
Lynch Toyota is very lucky to have this terrific person on
their team."
"01 11, 2015",Overall Pleased,"We rented this vehicle for a trip from Florida to California and back. We spent 3 weeks and 5800 miles in it. Two adults and probably 400 lbs of cargo. I found the gas mileage around home (35-55 mph with few lights) was around 34 mpg. On the road at 75 mph we got 27ish mpg on 10% ethanol and 28+ on pure gas. At 70 mph it gave 28.5ish on ethanol and 30-31 on real gas and at 65 it was 29 on ethanol and 32-33 on pure gas. Around L.A. (the city of cars & traffic) we averaged 24.5. Overall we got 28+ mpg. for the trip. 28 heading west and 28.5 going east. I found the wind affected the mileage greatly. For 2 adults it was fine. Rode comfortably. When the adult kids were with us we found issues with the back seat belts not wanting to release. The cup holders in the back are not very user friendly either. For my wife and I, I would consider buying one of these. If we had younger kids I would still consider it. For a family with teens, I'm not so sure. One thing I found I did not like but I got used to was the hood flexed and bounced around. I thought it wasn't latched tight, but it was."
"01  1, 2015",Love this SUV,"We really love this car and it's a Toyota. I worked at a GM dealer for 40 years as a mechanic so do know my cars. Previously owned a 2004 Pontiac Vibe which really was a Toyota Matrix with Pontiac badges. It was a fantastic car with no problems in 135,000 miles. Bad move GM as we loved the Vibe so much that when it came time to replace the Vibe GM had quit making them. We would have purchased a Matrix but Toyota quit making them also. Bad move Toyota. Had made up our minds to purchase a Subaru Outback but having seen way too many bad reviews on them using oil. Took a Rav4 for a test drive and loved it. Live in Montana and the AWD is amazing for getting around on the snow/icy roads. It gives almost too much confidence on how well it handles horrible roads. Was going tonight put snow tires on but it would have been wasted moneys because it goes anywhere with the factory highway tires. I could nitpick but all the great features make up for everything."
"12 20, 2014",Poor Cabin Design,"We are leasing a Rav 4. As with most cars you have to live with it a while to see short comings. The interior has many flaws, poor location for many switches which cannot be accessed without contortions. Very poor interior lighting, especially in the rear. The bottom of the doors collect mud and snow leaving your clothes a mess as well as the garage floor. No illumination for controls located on the door. The heated seats are not as effective as others I have owned. The gas tank is too small. The radio operation requires a Masters from MIT, hundreds of pages to the manual! I am glad I am leasing and not owning."
"10 23, 2014",My other Toyota experience is promising.,"This is a very good car for the money. Seems to be more economical than advertised. Practically noiseless, and well controllable."
"10 11, 2014",Navigation Blues,"I found the navigation screen almost impossible to use due to the glare. I have overcome this by using a $200. Garmin Nuvi, and stuck the suction onto a hockey puck then dropped the whole thing into the front cup holder. The power outlet is right there and the screen can be tilted toward the driver and is crystal clear regardless of bright sunlight. The puck fits snugly into the cup holder which is a convenient coincidence. As far as reading radio stations and other data, well that is still a problem for me, anyone got an idea?"
"10 10, 2014",Rav4 Ride!,Purchased 2014 Rav4 after comparing with other famous sports utility and been driving it for about 2 months now. Cabin is noisy and ride is bumpy!
"09 29, 2014",First time Toyota user,"this is the first time I have purchased a Toyota personally. I have had friends with them, but for me I have not owned one. So far, with the one month of use, I like the vehicle. I am a bit disappointed in the engine size but with time I hope to get use to it. On the highway it takes a bit to get the car moving..."
"09 23, 2014",Still learning,"Have owned the Rav4 for a month. We are very pleased with it so far. Ride and comfort are excellent. We are still learning what the car can do. The manual for electronics package alone is 200 pages. One small complaint, display screen is nearly flush with dash board and sometimes unreadable in bright sunlight."
"09 23, 2014",Nicest Car I have Ever Owned,"After reviewing rating online and consumer reports, I decided to see a Toyota Rav4 at the dealership. My husband and I found this vehicle to be everything we both were looking for in a sporty vehicle. Being that we like to do outdoor activities, Sunday drives, traveling, this vehicle provides everything we were looking for in a car. We purchase the XLE model that included the navigation. It has the sun roof, gps and other applications such as weather and traffic. It also has fog lights and many other features to make our trips enjoyable. We are very pleased with out purchase."
"09 18, 2014",bad MPG,"Dad MPG, this is my toyota, and i getting bad MPG 21 city; 26 hwy. love the radio and phone setup. at 4,000 miles. no problem."
"09 12, 2014",love my rav4,"It's really too early to give an impression of the things on the list, we just bought it yesterdqy. BUT, it was a replacement for a 2012 Rav 4 which was totaled in a MVA. Our 2012 was very reliable. Never had a bit of trouble with it. . I love Toyota!!"
"09  8, 2014",Make sure you're comfortable in the RAV4,"I've driven the RAV4 for about 1000 miles an overall I'm very happy, you as a prospective Rav 4 buyer compare the XLE and Limited for seat comfort. I find the armrest moves back-and-forth ""adjustable"" and sometimes is annoying and blocks the drink holder. Also a couple of the controls are in-conveniently placed above your left knee while sitting in the driver seat. I purchased the limited because I wanted blizzard pearl paint and I am very happy that I did I'm happy with all at this point after driving the thousand miles the liftgate is very convienient The pushbutton start is wonderful and the doorhandles lock and unlock is a very convenient feature. I would highly recommend the RAV4 for mileage and controls and drivability and I would recommend it to a friend"
"09  5, 2014",Good and bad.,"I just got a new 2014 RAV 4 Limited edition last month. I previously drove 2008 RAV 4 for 4 years and a 2012 Rave 4 XLE for 2 years. They are very reliable SUVs.

2014 RAV 4 Pro:
- Very reliable to drive during all season
- Easier to maneuver, turn and drive
- It has slightly better shock absorption capacity from uneven road than the previous models.
- Good mirrors that provide wider and better view of the road.
- Limited edition comes with lots of features, like back up camera, seat warmer etc.
- Good cargo space but less than the 2008 and 2012 models.
- Comes with two separate mats for winter and summer.
- Well priced for a SUV.

2014 RAV 4 Con:
- It has absolutely no leg space in the back passenger seats. It is impossible for normal height and tall people to seat comfortably at the back. It has less space than a normal sedan. The inside is tiny.
- The integrated software system for GPS and audio control is very bad and full of flaws.
- Consumes way more gas then the two previous models I drove.
- It has only two storage compartment at the front, smaller in size than the previous models. The previous models had multiple small compartments that were convenient to store things like sunglass, spare change for emergency and other electronic items like phones out of sight. The 2014 model have none of these. The compartment they made to keep phone is out in the open and every time the car stops even decelerating gradually, it slips and falls on the floor.
Overall, Toyota made 2014 RAV 4 cheap by cutting out all the useful, convenient little things. If you had a previous model with good features, don't change to this new model. If you are buying a RAV 4, buy a previous model with added features. I drove 2008 and 2012 models; they are very good, reliable cars with a better fuel mileage. If I had a Limited edition of 2012 RAV 4, I definitely would have kept it.
Good luck!"
"09  5, 2014",Third Toyota I've Owned,"I've been very satisfied with all 3 Toyotas I've had. I chose the RAV 4 because I needed a car large enough to hold a big dog crate (with the backseats down), but didn't want a huge SUV.
Had the car less than a month, but have been really happy with it."
"08 28, 2014",To Purchase or Not Purchase,"I own a 2014 XLE AWD. I've read the reviews and here are my thoughts:

Likes:
Flat, big cargo space for a little SUV.
MPG is what they claim... Hwy 29-32, City 24-28.
Bluetooth handless phone capability.
Control panel on steering wheel.

Dislikes:
Uncomfortable seat and head rest.
Blind spots due to high door design.
Heated seat option not available.
Glare on monitor screen.
Feels like a high center of gravity. Not stout.
Muffler and pipes visible.
Yes, the hood does bounce.
Funky cruise control post.
Lack of comfortable driver arm rests.
Yes, there is a vibration with windows open.
Unable to activate/deactivate all interior lights with one switch.

Recommendation:
I can't recommend this vehicle primarily because the seats are uncomfortable and there are too many blind spots due to high door design."
"08 22, 2014",Just fine,"I've owned this car for a month - 2014 xle. Purchased this over the Mazda CX-5 because of the price alone (Toyota has bargaining power. Mazda doesn't at this point). I've owned a lot of Toyotas and they all drive pretty much the same. The second I drove this car, I felt comfortable. It responds well, it feels exactly like other toyotas I've owned. I'm not, however, blown away. There is a crazy glare on the screen. I'm technologically savvy and the computer system organization doesn't make any freaking sense. I've read the manual, spent more time than I have on candy crush personalizing the navigation, and I still can't get a seamless experience when driving. The voice command doesn't understand me and I've tried to calibrate it multiple times. Other issues - I have to step back every time I open the back door and there aren't enough storage compartments (I used to own a 2 door Yaris with more small-storage space than this car). Those things aside - it's a toyota and has AMAZING resell value (My yaris depriciated $200 in 5 years) and amazing reliability and my dealer has a great service department. I'm not crazy about this car, but for the money and the company, it's a great choice."
"08 16, 2014",I Love my Rav 4,It's sporty and responsive. I can't imagine owning anything else. Everyone that has looked at it will be considering the Rav 4 for their next vehicle. Toyota makes such a great product!
"08 13, 2014",Best car that I can see out of really good,I can see out of this vehicle all around and love the backup camera.It rides a little like a truck but it has big wheels so that is probably the reason.All in all I like this vehicle.
"08  9, 2014",Overall excellent...some disappointments,"I bought this car to replace a well used and loved 2006 Highlander. The mileage in the RAV4 is substantially higher. It is not quite as large, but will do the job.

I've been driving it for almost a month and following are my comments.

Disappointments:
1. Noisy, jumpy ride
2. Terrible radio
3. No remote opener for garage doors (on top model)
4. No space for sunglasses and other odds and ends
5. Non locking glove compartment (!)
6. Overly complex electronics
7. Hard seats
8. Would like stronger headlights (as I have aged, my eyes get worse at night vision)

What I like:
1. It's a Toyota (dependable and effecient)
2. Nice looking vehicle
3. Decent cargo capacity
4. Power liftgate (reason I didn't consider CRV)"
"08  6, 2014",RAV 4,"Better equipment and technology than a Honda CRV. Trying to get adjusted to a smaller vehicle (sold Ram1500 4X4 Quad Cab) Not a solid as the Rm but better mileage. Choice was between Ford Edge, CRV and RAV4. Edge & RAV4 equal except in price."
"08  3, 2014",Good SUV,"I have owned Toyotas for last 25 years and happy with the performance. With basic maintenance, never had any major problems. New RAV-4 Limited has lots of options that normally I expected in Lexus or luxury car.
Navigation, Backup camera, Blind spot, Lane designation, etc. makes it easy to drive. Ride is not very comfortable as car or van but I expected that being SUV."
"07  9, 2014",Not so pleased,"After driving a 2011 Nissan Rogue, I purchased a RAV4 basically for the looks and Toyota's rep on quality. Trading it in. The seats are hard and uncomfortable and the ride is like a wagon. I can feel every bump! I purchased the XLE and even though it has back up camera, bluetooth, etc, NO electric seats, no sunglass case. I couldve done without the sunroof for electric seats and a better ride!!!"
"06 16, 2014",Realistic Review,"6/16/2014

This is an objective and realistic review from a person who has owned a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD for two weeks and has completed several 300 mile trips. Male, 5'8"", 180 lbs, age 50.

PROS

- Hwy MPG averaging 31.
- Cargo Space is larger than competition.
- Voice activated Bluetooth cellular functionality.
- Voice and Hand activated stereo functionality.
- Seems like a quiet smooth ride.
- Front seat side cushions are comfortable.
- AWD availability.
- Reliable track record.

CONS

- Nowhere to rest elbows during driving. Uncomfortable. Try it.
- Seat is hard an uncomfortable after 2 hours.
- No neck support...There is a monster head support that doesn't adjust well, but why can't mfgrs make a nice neck support!!
- Very very loud rumble/vibration if rear windows are open during driving.
- Can't read air/heat temperature because the mounting plate is tilted toward sunroof reflection.
- New ""sleek"" design is less functional providing less cargo space and access for large items.
- More door height and less window... personal preference to have more window, less door panel.
- Heated seats not available...Come on gang!!!

I believe the 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD is more ""sporty"" than comfortable and is targeted to the younger generation. I believe the focus is to attract this market with a ""sleek"" design and bells and whistles provided thru the monitor screen. Most of the mini SUV mfgrs appear to be copying each other with this new design.

Personally, I prefer to have more cargo space than a ""sleek"" design so I can fit things into my mini SUV. The loveseat I recently purchased won't fit because they tapered off the back end. Otherwise, it would have fit. I would also prefer more seat comfort, elbow rests and neck rest! If you want comfort, make sure you test drive it several times. The Honda CRV seemed more comfortable but had less cargo area. It is a nice looking vehicle and has some bells to play with, but try to look beyond looks and whistles if you also desire functionality and comfort."
"05 30, 2014",Not as good as CRV,"Rav-4 no sunglass holder, front hood has sun glare, does not take bumps and potholes as good as Honda CRV,rear child locks needed. Leased will tolerate for few years."
"05 29, 2014",Toyota rav4 is the best SUV,If you are on the market for a SUV you can not go past the rav4 becomes it is not that expensive to by and it has a grate re-sale value. Also if you are looking for a SUV that can be used for mol table courses such as for off roading or for camping or for local city driving well I recommend this is the perfect car for you.
"05 26, 2014",one of the most reliable cars i have owned,"viewing excellent, dual air conditioning in front, bluetooth hands off to control phone, and radio, power sun roof, new styling front fenders and rear lights. great car probably the last car I will buy!!!"
"05 20, 2014",First brand new car,It is my first brand new car. I feel so relax by driving it. I definitely love my new Toyota Rav4 and I will recommend my friend to buy it.
"05 19, 2014","Happy with Wellesley Toyota, Wellesley MA","I am very happy with TOyota RAV4. It has a beautiful exterior in greay and the interior is also impressive.

What impressed me was the Sales Manager who sold me the car. He was one of the best representatives of any Toyota dealer I've gone to, Martin Hansberry of Wellesley Toyota explained the features of several makes and i am very happy with his suggestions. We negotiated for a price and I was very happy with our final agreement. I had prevously gone to another dealer in Framingham and was very dissatisfied even though I had purchased three other new Toyotas from that same dealer, Their offer was insulting and I will never go back.
Happily Wellesley Toyota makes me a customer for life.."
"05 17, 2014",great car,"After looking at the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester I decided on the Rav 4. I own 4 Camrys for a business and sold an older one last year with 249,000 miles. Toyota reliability speaks for itself. I got the LE with roof rack, mats and mud flaps. Rides nice with wrap around seats. Great gas mileage compared to my trade in 2003 6 cyl. Mazda Tribute. Engine has plenty of power. Sound system is great with Bluetooth and IPOD capability. I removed the rear seat passenger headrest for better visibility when I don't have passengers. But mirrors are positioned well. Looking out the front window over towards the passenger side front area takes some getting use to as the fender is flared upwards. Would recommend this to a friend for sure"
"05 15, 2014",2014 Rav 4 LE......seat comfort,"Regarding the 2014 RAV 4 LE:
Recently test drove it, then purchased it. Does any one else feel a springy band across the seat cushions which bounces into your butt when you drive? This is a really weird feeling! and it's right under your butt! It appears to be in all the seats, but I feel it especially in the front bucket seats.
If I felt it before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
"05  8, 2014",Fabulous!,I absolutely love my brand new Rav 4! I am 62 yrs. old and this is my first brand new car and I feel like a queen! It has everything I need in it and more! It drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage! I would definitedly tell my friends to buy one of these!
"05  5, 2014",Reliability,"Love my Rav 4 so far, especially the flexibility of drive modes. Very important to save on fuel. Will reserve final review after I drive through snow!"
"05  3, 2014",2012 Rav 4,"My 4th Toyota, 1st SUV, 1st preowned car. Absolutely love it! Was nervous about preowned, but it's an excellent car. Of course, it's Toyota!."
"05  3, 2014",good value,"I have owned 7 new Toyota's over the years and am constantly amazed at how they choose the ""standard"" features for each model. They don't seem to make any common sense. For example. My new RAV-4 XLE comes with a standard power sunroof which I might use 2 times as year! I would rather have the 8-way power seat which my wife and I would use every day!
Also the placement of the electric outside driver mirror switch is in a difficult location to operate. I have to look down towards the floor and to the far left, totally away from the road. I have to pull over and stop just to change the angle of the mirror! Also to operate the radio is a nightmare, I have been through the manual but cannot understand how to lock in a new station. What ever happened to just turning a knob and pushing a button? It's crazy!"
"05  1, 2014",Tuff for my gsd,"The only things I don't like
1. No Keyless trunk open (offered on limited, but had to get leather seats to get limited)
2. Got to ""pump"" yah seat up w a lever on side. Not electric.
I"
"04 27, 2014",Hooked on Toyota,"This review is based solely on dealer test drives, therefore my ratings on this RAV4 are limited. However, something may need to be asked about driver visibility on this vehicle. I am over six feet and yet when I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful SUV, I see all hood and no road. Even with a height adjustment, this unfortunate design still exists. I owned a 2003 RAV4 and I remember its selling point to me was the clarity of vision while sitting behind the wheel. Am I the only one reacting this way? My wife and I want to buy this vehicle but this is an issue that troubles us. Any thoughts on this?"
"04 23, 2014",nice car,FOCUS ON THE VEHICL'E FEATURES AND BE SPECIFIC. DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEFORE REVIEWING IT. INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE AND SPECIFIC DEALERSHIP.
"04 19, 2014",thought we liked it not at all,we leased 2013 xle its ok ride is terrible accelerates terrible no power very cheap interior not real happy had it for a year wish we got a camry highlander I think were paying to much for that vehicle to
"04 15, 2014",poor Rav-4,This is the worst SUV that i have ever brought...it has not space and have a really bad 4-wheel drive
"04 13, 2014",Updates on 2014 RAV 4,"Back cargo area has insufficient lighting ( adding ) more of my own. Radio control panel/Navigation impossible to use in certain sunlight, Not just a little. Also, some switches behind and lower of steering are very difficult to use because steering wheel blocks them out. Like the cars. but these three things are very irritating to me,. And I think the 2 year, 25,000 mile warranty would have been a deal breaker if I was thinking more clearly."
"04 12, 2014",Two Weeks from Purchase,"I had a tough time in deciding between the Terrain and the RAV4, but more acceleration (translating safety) and wife's comfort in the seats was the final determinant. Previously owning a '06 Camry also pointed toward reliability. Last weekend we took a round trip of about 400 miles, and I perceived a much stiffer ride than that of the Camry, although it is quite nimble in handling, and quieter. I did notice that on bumpy roads the hood vibrated, especially along the back leading edge. (Perhaps I am too picky.) Investigation revealed just a flexible plastic ""support"" structure under this edge, no steel, so no bolstering pad can be applied under the hood there. This design flaw should be ameliorated.

The transmission shifts well, but the audio controls are a bit confusing for old folks, even though we are computer literate.

Would I buy it again after this two weeks of driving experience? Probably, but its just like getting married - its going to take a while to adjust to the changes, and to really KNOW, although you have committed for life."
"04  9, 2014",Perfect starter SUV,"This is a lux, easy to use and drive ""starter"" SUV. It has a comfortable ride and it feels sturdy and safe. I appreciate that it has an eco and sport mode, and it comes with a lot of upgraded features even in the base LE. My only complaint is the touch screen. I wish it was either angled to the driver or had a small lip or visor over it as when the sun is out it becomes very hard to read."
"04  8, 2014",Smooth Driving Machine,This is a reliable crossover/SUV with a lot of inner space and comfort for front row and back row passengers.
"04  7, 2014",Great vehicle,Very pleased with this RAV 4!!!!!!! Bought the limited after not planning for anything past the XLE. Turned out to be a great decision! Highly recommended!!!!'mm
"03 22, 2014","nice vehicle, but not totally satisfied","This review is on the 2014 Rav4 Limited Edition.
While the exterior and interior are great to look at....I have some reservations on the vehicle regarding majority of the interior.
1. My #1 complaint is about the touchscreen radio. I wear polarized sunglasses (to minimize glare) but when the sun hits the screen...I can't see ANYTHING on the touchscreen radio!! I have to take my glasses off and then I can KIND of see. They should make the touch screen anti-glare or something because even when not wearing my sunglasses, when the sun hits the screen it is VERY difficult to see anything.
2. There are NO INTERIOR LIGHTING in the glove compartment, center console, or cargo area!!!! So, when it's night time and I have to get something from the glove box or center compartment I have to use the lighting from the top by the rear view mirror. And if I have to get anything in the cargo area at night...forget about it!!! I can't see anything, so I have to get out a flashlight or use my cell phone to look around. Granted, I do have black interior but still...at the very least wouldn't you think that there'd be SOME kind of lighting for the cargo area?!
3. There are very few interior compartments and the center console is pretty shallow compared to other vehicles I've had. At the very least, for the limited edition they could have included a compartment for your glasses. I find myself having to stuff everything into one place since there's such limited room. My smaller Honda Civic had wayyy more compartments and little nooks than this bigger size Rav4.
4. I'm sure they added all of the plastic pieces to the vehicle to save $. It would've been nicer without it, but of course it would've been much more expensive.
Aside from all of that...I will say, the vehicle is a beauty to look at. I really like the different things you can do with the radio, change settings to certain things to fit what you want, and I absolutely love the heated seats. The ECO mode and the SPORT mode are interesting...but I honestly don't feel too much of a difference. The vehicle is very smooth to drive and I'm hoping to be keeping it around for another 10+ years!"
"03 20, 2014",Love my Rav4,Just traded in my 2005 Rav4 for a new 2014 one. Love the interior and the comfort. The outside is beautiful. Interior features I did not know was in there. As always it drives so smoothly and effortlessly. Would not of traded in my old Rav4 but the new features on the new one will make my life easier. I never had a problem with the old one and am sure I will experience the same high quality on the new Rav4.
"03 19, 2014",Can't beat a Toyota,"Out of the other cars in this class that I looked at, I like the fact that the RAV4 sits up a bit higher. I also like that the spare wheel is no longer mounted on the hatch door but located inside, I also like that the hatch door rises up, versus opening from left to right. Much easier for loading/unloading to have the door out of the way.

The back seats fold down fairly flat. I don't have to remove the head rests or move the front seats up any.

I wish that Toyota had kept the lock on the glove box, but I guess they have to reduce costs somewhere. The inside styling is a little more functional and looks nice. The rear view camera is a nice addition.

I love the hands-free calling thru the radio. The sound quality is very good. No more tunnel sounds or wind-rushing sounds on the other end. Easy to set up and use. The voice activated calling is great. I was very surprised. I also like that Pandora, when open on my phone, automatically streams thru the radio as soon as I turn on the ignition.

I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but so far it is great.

The only drawback at this point, is the cloth seat has a seam indentation near the seat-back. At first I thought this was a defect in the cushion, but soon discovered that it is the style of the seat. It is kind of strange to get used to at first, but I'm sure eventually I'll forget about it.

The heated air takes about 5 minutes to warm up when the car is cold, and is not super hot, but adequate to stave of the cold. I find in general, that Toyotas take a bit longer to reach a hot air temperature, compared to other brands.

I also find that I have to be careful to shut the door firmly, otherwise the latch catches, but the door isn't shut all the way. Several times I have failed to shut either the hatch or side doors properly and have to open and re-shut them. Only a minor nuisance.

By the way, this review is based on the LE, automatic transmission. I really wanted the heated seats, but did not want to sacrifice the 3inches of head space for the sun-roof. I think it is a great car and will give me many years of satisfaction."
"03 10, 2014",Love my RAV4!,"I purchased a Camry XLE in December 2013. I HATED it. So, after 2 months of driving it I traded it in for a 2014 RAV4 XLE. It was so worth it. I love everything about this car. I love the way it looks, the interior styling and features, the exterior, the technology, the way it drives-it's *exactly* what I wanted in a new vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it. The *one* thing I do wish it had more of is interior compartments/storage nooks-like a coin compartment or a compartment for my sunglasses. That's the only thing it lacks.
I am so glad that I didn't waste any more time with the Camry and got my RAV4.
I couldn't be happier with it!"
"03  8, 2014",Glad I Purchased,"I originally test drove this car based on a friend's recommendation. He has an older model RAV4 and is pleased with it.

I have been driving my new RAV4 for approximately one month, and I am enjoying it! The only reason for 4 stars in the ""Comfort"" category is that I find that when getting into the driver's seat, I have to make sure to be positioned perfectly (for me) or, if driving for an extended period, I begin to get somewhat uncomfortable. I think that this problem will go away as the car and I ""get used to each other"", so not a biggie in the downgrade department.

One review I read (before buying) did not think the car had fast enough acceleration when in the ""eco"", or efficient gas mode. However, I keep it in ""eco"" all the time and have not had any trouble safely accelerating while entering highway traffic. Also, my latest MPG was 26 combined town and highway, with more local than highway driving.

In short....I love this vehicle and think Toyota has done an outstanding design job! I can't think of an item they may have overlooked."
"03  5, 2014",Love my Rav4,"I've had my car for over a month and really love it. The seats are comfortable and everything is within reach when driving. The blue tooth does not work as well as I wish it did, but I bought the car for its reliability and safety. So far I am getting better gas mileage than my 2007 Camry (it was a v6). The drive is smooth and if I want a little more kick, I can change from the eco setting to the sport setting. If I could change anything, I wish the back window was a little larger and that I could get more visibility out of it especially when trying to zip in and out of traffic. Other than that, it's a winner."
"03  5, 2014",My favorite car of all time,"This is my third Rav4. I owned a 2001 and 2005 Rav4 previously. I needed a bigger car in 2008 and the Sienna felt a little small. I purchased a 2008 Chrysler Town & Country. What a mistake that was, I had nothing but problems from the day I purchased it. It is a beautiful car but poorly built. I have NEVER had a problem with my Rav4's so I went back to that. It is the best car ever!!!
Thank you Toyota!
Catherine"
"02 25, 2014",Over & above my expectations!,"My family has always had Fords, but we wanted to try a lease and had seen the good deals on the Toyota Rav 4 - went to Spitzer in Monroeville and dealt with Jim Yoxall - he was excellent! He took the time to explain the lease to us, and answer any questions we had on the car, it was over and above all my expectations! It handles so smoothly, ride is extremely comfortable, has many features and has done wonderful on gas mileage for us. The car has done extremely well in the bad weather we have recently had in PA, and I would highly recommend this car! If anyone is unsure of a Toyota take a trip to Spitzer and ask to talk to Jim and see what a good deal and exceptional vehicle hecan put you in. I will definitely return to Spitzer to deal again when our lease is up."
"02 19, 2014",Great experience,I recently bought a Rav 4 from a salesmen by the name of Shawn. He was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. I had a great experience and I feel like everyone should know.....Go see the boys of Lakewood Toyota!!
"02 14, 2014",Fun and Sassy to Drive,"This vehicle has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Just turned 10K miles. Fun to drive and a wow factor too. I purchased it for local, run around yet overall smaller than the previous Sienna . It fit those profiles. Now, unexpectedly I've had to make to long haul trips (750 mi) each way and guess what? Quiet, smooth, exceptional handling and good gas mileage too. These I did not expect with a small SUV. The ""sport mode"" really gives this little engine some get up and go! Usually drive in the economy mode though. I do wish I had bought the auto rear deck opener. I think a good value with Toyota quality included."
"01 30, 2014",Good Reliable compact SUV for my daughter,Good and nice small compact SUV for daughter. so she can go to college and work.good gas milege and saving money
"01 16, 2014",my 2014 not as good aS OUR 2011,"OUR 2014 DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR 2011

BUT WE DO LIKE THE MISSING OUTSIDE SPARE
THE SEATS COULD USE MORE PADDING
THIS ONE DONT HAVE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS"
"01  7, 2014",Third New Toyota,"Toyota's have always given me excellent service. They are reliable, well- built and affordable.Sales staff highly professional and courteous. Volunteered information and advice that made purchase experience very enjoyable."
"12  5, 2023",rav4 very gud,"Overall, the RAV4 is a great car for commuting, families of four, and space. The RAV4 is the best when it comes to reliability. The RAV4 is very spacious in the second row and the trunk and the car offers comfortable seats. The RAV4 gets okay fuel economy but it does do decent in the snow. However there are some things that it lacks. The RAV4's navigation system is very frustrating to use, just use google maps instead. The RAV4's interior quality is not that great either, there are tons of fake buttons and plastic throughout the interior, but no one who buys a RAV4 cares about the interior. The RAV4 has decent styling, but it is not as stylish as the Mazda CX-5. The RAV4 only has 1 engine option, but does not feel underpowered. The RAV4 also doesn't have a very quiet or comfortable ride. Even though the seats are comfortable, the ride is loud and the inside rattles frequently. If you don't care about luxury and want a practical, reliable car, the RAV4 is perfect."
"07 26, 2023",Very Reliable!!,I absolutely am in love with my Rav! The gas mileage is great! I have owned my Rav for years! I just turned over 100000 miles on it. I have not had any big problems with it at all! They don't make cars like this anymore! My RAV is so very reliable!  It also does super great in the snow as well!
"06 28, 2023",THE BEST NEW CAR EVER PURCHASED BY ME!!!,"Owned a silver 2014 Rav 4 XLS for 9+ years now. The best car I have ever owned to date just required to do regular oil and filter changes 2 brake jobs and routine maintenance. Very good on gas consumption compared to my GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherooke!"
"07 15, 2022",Not recommend for anybody,My stereo system keep showing loading signals and then blackout. It’s completely not working. Called Toyota made a complaint and no solution. Lots people having the same issue. They have to have a recall on that. Worst customer service in Toyota. I will never buy it. I will not recommend Toyota to anybody either
"03  3, 2022",Toyota RAV4 2014,"Best cat I've ever had almost up to 450,000 Kilometres and have had no problems. It's never broke down and the Sports mode is a Beast."
"04  8, 2021",Toyota is for everv and reasonable price,It’s a good car reliable comfort easy to use and drive trustable  smooth spacious three option of speed and low gas consumtion per hundred mile.
"03 31, 2021",Best car I've owned since 1982,This car is simply fabulous in every way!!!!! :)  I feel safe and comfortable and I finally have a radio that works! Could not be happier.
"09 14, 2020",Very fast,I love my car it the ride fit for mi and my family and is good in gas too and very comfortable nice in side
"08 18, 2020",The best car I've owned.,"Toyota RAV4 is a very good compact SUV, and it's easy to see why it's one of the best-selling nameplates in the United States. It delivers impressive fuel economy and comes loaded with plenty of standard features. This Toyota also has an upscale, roomy interior."
"07 19, 2020",Nicest used Cari have ever owned.,This car net all my needs. As a tall-ish guy this car offered a lot of interior room and leg space. It has great gas mileage and handles nicely.
"07 14, 2020",Once I go back  home for good I will buy the same!,"This car was very good for me. I need to sell it Because I'm going back home for good. I will buy the same car for sure!
Money saver.. only 4 cylinder!"
"03  4, 2020",Great value in a sport ute,"Styling, comfort and reliability fully met Toyota expectations.  Fuel economy is a bit less than hoped, but security of 4x4 drive in severe Winter conditions worthwhile.  It’s everything from a grocery getter to regular commuter.  Even gets occasional light duty off-road use on fishing and hunting trips."
"02 27, 2020",Never Letting this one go!!,"I got my 2014 in late 2017 as I was in the process of a divorce and working 2 jobs. Traded in my 2012 Corolla for this. The Vechile is now 6 years old and the suspension and steering still feel like brand new, mine is a base model LE with a Sport and Eco Mode. The Eco Mode on mine I find to limiting, (best if you’re going on a long trip with a low speed limit not during Rush hour at best.) Sport Mode on the other hand is a dream come true driving. The Interior after helping my mom boy her ‘13, my ex-husband buy a ‘15 and my best friend buy a ‘17 does feel a bit on the cheaply made side.  But apart from that it’s wonderful! My Rav has AWD, Traction control, and (thankfully it became standard) a backup camera."
"01 29, 2020",Great vehicle,Great vehicle with lots of room. It is easy to drive and handle. Has lots of room in back for wheelchair or other needed items.
"01 28, 2020",Third RAV4 in the family,"Just purchased a used '11 RAV4 for our daughter to join the '04 and '14 RAV4s already in the family. Great reliability, good gas mileage, compact/easy to maneuver and park, good safety...what's not to like. Because I'm a large guy, slightly bigger seats would be nice, but hardly a show-stopper. Also, I really enjoy all of the additional ""luxury"" items included in my '14 Limited edition, e.g., AWD, blind side monitor, back-up camera, XM radio, heated seats, bluetooth, auto headlights."
"01 21, 2020",2014 RAV radio issues,"My 2014 Rav 4 stereo just went out!!  The bluetooth began to kick on and off a few days ago,  I thought is was issues with my phone."
"01  8, 2020",Meet my expectation in every way,"I owned this car since 2014. The front seat at least for a smaller person (5'6"") is comfy, though an adjustable lumbar support would make the seat better.Engine power is enough to easily get up to speed on most interstate ramps.  Gas mileage is not better than advertised except on long flat runs in the mid 60 mph range, then I get 35mpg or better.  This car has very usable load room. I had many long trips with family and it's best car."
"01  5, 2020","Attractive, functional, reliable, affordable",The perfect car for getting around town comfortably.  Comfortable ride and lots of room inside.  Brand new tires and battery.  Very solid gas mileage and handles great city or highway.

"09 27, 2019",Versatile and Reliable,"Full disclosure:  I used to sell Toyota, Buick, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks.  For my money, Toyota offers extreme reliability at a reasonable cost. My 3014 RAV4 was Toyota Certified with 35,000 miles on the odometer.  Two and a half years later the RAV4 has 90,000 plus miles. The SUV still runs and looks like new. I have done only routine maintenance, replaced original equipment tires with Michelins and replaced the radio with a Kenwood model that featured Apple CarPlay. This RAV4 was as close to a good investment as any car or truck I ever purchased."
"06 10, 2019",5 years never any mechanical issues. Great car!,"I am a big guy. This car is very comfortable to drive with plenty of legroom. Family loves it for long trips to the mountains and beach.  Also plenty of room in the trunk for all my families grocery, toys and if you need even more room like bringing home 20 bags of bark from the garden supply store just make rear seat flat."
"05 20, 2019",It’s Toyota got to be reliable! Enjoying the Ride,"This car meets our needs very reliable comfortable ride ! Great on gas, would recommend same vehicle to friends and family . For a used vehicle and of course a Toyota you know your getting a great car. The 2014 Rav 4 is great and it was a one owner car well taken car of we are now a Toyota family along with my Tundra.

"04  8, 2019",Very nice vehicle I love it,This vehicle was just what I was looking for. I have owned Volvo’s  this vehicle is just as nice and very easy to drive  love it
"03 27, 2019",Great vehicle,"Plenty of room, easy to get in and out of.  Seats are comfortable.  Love the back up camera, the Bluetooth feature easy to handle and good on gas"
"02  9, 2019",Things gone bad,Radio quit working after warranty expired.  Car was less than 3 years old.  Toyota is not standing by their product and won't replace it even though this is a common problem.  Now transmission fluid is leaking.  Car is a lemon!
"01 30, 2019",Pontiac vibe,You cannot go wrong with the Toyota engine very dependable good on gas all wheel drive is the way to go with the 1.8 engine
"01  9, 2019",I like RAV4 limited owsam. Car I like everything,Really good family car  it has all the features that we need to make our life luxury  plus previous owner installed Remot Startar  i recommend everyone one to buy limited rav4
"01  2, 2019",Toyota reliability is nearly unmatched,"I purchased this vehicle to be my personal take me to the mountains, rivers, golf course, etc.  It has been totally reliable and given good comfort doing it.  On long trips I get better than advertised gas mileage."
"12 23, 2018",Disappointing!,"Too many issues...been serviced only at  Griffin ...radio/stereo quit working and all door locks do not work!!  Only 41,000 miles!!!!  Very dissatisfied and disappointed in problems and cost to tepair issues that should have not even been an issue with such a new car!!!"
"12  5, 2018",Lots of road noise,When we drove it a little sluggish when asked to get up to freeway speed and enough road noise anyone in the back seat couldn't hear.
"11 27, 2018",coolest most reliable car I have owned !!!,I needed a car that was AWD and simple - this rides on the snow like a snow mobile especially if you add snow tires...gas mileage is great and style is perfect for me !!! I love em' so much I bought a second !!!
"11  4, 2018",Most best value car i ever owned,This car exhibited all my needs. One of the best value price car. Design is really great. Very comfortable car. Most successful car from Toyota for the reasonable price
"10 15, 2018",reliable and lots of room,"This vehicle has definitely met my needs being roomy, all wheel drive and I am able to use the racks on top for transporting my kayaks  and by the way, I love the color."
"10  2, 2018",Can't compare to any other small SUV,"We looked for several other cars before getting this RAV4. We compared to a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and Honda CRX. But none of those cars compares to our Toyota. We love how smooth it is to drive, how fuel efficient it is, the cargo space has no comparison and even though we own an LE (lowest trim), the interior is very comfortable, and it has almost every accommodation that the competitors' mid trims have (except the automatic lights)"
"08  8, 2018",A nice and reliable car to own,It is really good for me with all my needs. I will buy the newest model to have the best and latest accessories every one is longing for.
"07 18, 2018",Zippy dependable commuter and traveling vehicle.,Owned the car for four years.  I love how it handles and quickly accelerates.  The ride could be smoother and quieter.  I never had to take it to the shop for anything other than maintenance.
"06 27, 2018","Easy to buy, own, resell","On second RAV4. Great mileage for an SUV non-hybrid. Excellent acceleration in Economy mode, never mind Sport. Roomy enough for four adults . Lots of storage."
"06 23, 2018",We are a Toyota Family,This was an easy choice.  Toyota is a great brand and we know we can always count on the car!!  Thanks for being there for the family.
"06 22, 2018",Versatility is the best of all cars owned.,"This car has usability that prior cars could never equal, with the rear seats being able to push all the way down flat. This allows extending the cargo area enough to carry items most cars would not be able to. Yet, it's smaller in length, so it fits nicely into smaller spaces."
"06  4, 2018",Most comfortable Automobile I have owned.,"I found myself in need of a vehicle that will perform well in snow due to job location change.
The Rav4 has exceeding my expectations for comfort and has performed very well in snow.
My job is at one of the higher elevations and at the top of the hill...I see many vehicles sliding
when it snows and I have had no problem at all."
"05 30, 2018",Disappointed but I don?t hate the car,I wish I shopped around more and looked and more cars in the same class. It took me a little while and I started to find this this car really lacked!
"05 26, 2018",Most reliable car ever,This car makes me drive like a boss as I just stated my own business I would like to have this rav4 do that I can never worry about breakdowns
"05 24, 2018",Great suv,The RAV4 is a great suv. I bought it because I needed a bigger car than my Camry when I got a dog and bought a house. The 75lb pup has room and I have room for transporting yard clean up to the dump. Because of my raves about this car 2 of my friends are now happy RAV4 owners.
"05 19, 2018",Love my Rav4,"Great cargo space. Love the backup camera, steering wheel controls for audio and bluetooth. Deep cup holders so bottles won't rattle around and plenty of storage for all the things I keep in the car. Bought it at a great dealership - A1 Toyota in New Haven CT. Wouldn't shop anywhere else."
"05 16, 2018",Best car i have ever driven.,This car is reliable and comfortable to drive. It holds its value and feels very safe driving in the winter weather. Only car I will ever own.
"05  3, 2018",I have always wanted to own one.,"Overall I am pleased. Improvements could be made on quality of interior. A storage compartment on the dash for a cell phone or transponder. Also, better floor mats."
"04 21, 2018",I got exactly what I was told i will be getting.,The vehicle was in excellent condition and the price was also less than average market value. Due to the low price i did not even had to bargain
"03 30, 2018",Love my RAV,"My sister recommended the RAV and I really like mine.  I've driven it almost 100,000 km since 2015 and would definitely buy another one.  Gas mileage is great with my 4 cylinder engine.  No blind spots when you change lanes compared to my Ford Escape.  Never had one issue with it in the 3 years I've owned it."
"03 21, 2018",We're on our 2nd Rav4 and most likely to #3?,The Rav4 is the perfect vehicle for us. There's plenty room for whatever you do. The rear seats fold down for even more cargo space. Dependability is just another reason we love our Toyota.
"03 20, 2018","I love Toyota, and I especially love my 2014 Rav4","The Rav4 is well priced for its comfort, options and performance.  It drives and handles like a much more expensive vehicle, is super dependable and a very comfortable ride."
"03  7, 2018",Review of 2014 Toyota RAV4,"Would prefer armrests for long driving.  - Hoped I would get 30 mpg on long trips. Am near but not quite able to accomplish that yet. - Very comfortable for long periods in car.  Car suspension system especially comfortable.  - Have added a hitch, crossbars for roof rack, fog lights to increase usefulness of this car.  Wish seats would fold forward completely to leave a flat surface in the back of the car.  As it is there is a slight incline where the seats fall forward. -  All driving apparatus near at hand and their use is not difficult to grasp for the first-time driver.  Wish car's odometer would always show (it doesn't) when looking for other available readings such as current mpg, average mpg, Trip A, Trip B, etc.  - Am a hard marker so I think the 4 stars I have given is a very high rating for the car.    5 Stars might have been given but for the exceptions mentioned above."
"03  1, 2018",Adore my Rav 4,"Perfect size, great features, drives like a dream and is very comfortable. So glad I found this vehicle. It?s perfect! Even used its rock solid."
"02 27, 2018",Very smooth ride.,"I have only owned this vehicle for a few weeks but so far I love it. It rides smooth and has a sleek design.
If I were to have recommended an improvement it would be to improve the quality of the interior."
"02 13, 2018",Beautiful Car,I love this car. It is so nice inside and out. I bought it used and it has held up its value vary nicely. I would buy it again.
"02  7, 2018",Not the most reliable,"I've driven this car for three years now, we are at 85,000 km and the transmission is now failing. Any one having the same problem?"
"02  2, 2018",I love my RAV4,RAV4 is a great car for travel and to cruise around town. It is spacious and comfortable and I am enjoying every bit of it.
"01 31, 2018",I love RAV-4 Toyota,"It is confortable, cute, economic. And is perfect for women like me. It is not expensive and  I can fell sure driving far away or I. Express way for it estabity."
"01 29, 2018",Multi functional car.,The rav is zippy around town and gets 22 mpg as rated.  The all wheel drive works great in the snow.  I can haul a six foot step ladder with the rear seats down.  Tall adults can ride comfortably in the back seat.  I have gotten 31mpg on the highway.
"01 17, 2018",Very reliable car.,"I very seldom drive it, my wife drives the majority of the time. The size of the vehicle is much easier for to drive. Previously owned a GMC Acadia she didn't like the vehicle to big."
"01  9, 2018",Best Car Ever!!!,I had wanted a Rav 4 for a long time and now that I have one I am not disappointed!  This car handles the road well under any conditions.  I am very happy with the 29 mpg it gets.  It is very comfortable for long distance trips  both front and back with lots of leg room.  It has a spacious cargo area that I use constantly.  The interior feels very luxurious especially with all the features that came on this model.  When it is time for a new vehicle I will definitely get another Toyota Rav 4!
"12 30, 2017",LOVE my RAV 4's!!!,"Just upgraded to this vehicle....I've owned 2 others and never looked back! Excellent performance & handling, roomy, comfortable and safe for my 16 year old daughter to drive!!"
"12 28, 2017",this rav 4 has nore room inside than you think,"the rav4 is great on gas for being a awd car it has comfortable room for someone who is 6'5  and i have alot of leg room and for people in the back seats it has alot of room as well ,and when you put the seats down you haul a good amount of things as well"
"12 11, 2017",Great Car,This car met my needs.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and the back.  It rides nice and goes great in the snow.  I'm really enjoying the car.
"12  1, 2017",Love this car!,We purchased this car in October and it is great. It was a great value relative to other comparable? vehicles and we love it.
"11 29, 2017",RAV4 owner,"I purchased this car almost a year ago, after having an older model RAV4.  I love love love this car."
"11 11, 2017",the most reliable car i have owned is the one i'm,i like it because it's good on gas. it's comfortable all the way around. we go on long rides now and i don't have to get out half way threw the trip.
"11 10, 2017",AMAZING,Just bought one it is gorgeous. Cannot wait to drive my new car!!!!! The sunroof is an awesome buying feature!
"11 10, 2017",Great relialablity,Great driving enjoy the heated seats and sun roof. Electric rear hatch is easy to use and very useful.
"11 10, 2017",2012 and older were built much better,Car is just okay very disappointed after owning a 2012 rave 4 quality was sacrificed for cheaper plastics to get more fuel mileage
"11  2, 2017",My first smaller car,It met all my needs. I got good gas mileage with it. I had no problems and service was great. They did all the paper work when I bought the car.
"11  2, 2017","I leased this car new, liked it so  I bought it.","Easy to drive, easy to park. Service was great. the only problem I had was when I bought it at the end of my lease I had to wait about 5 weeks to get my title to register the after I had paid for it in full"
"10 24, 2017",Relability+,Great highway vehicle. Great fuel economy coupled with plenty of engine power. Enough goodies to make the vehicle enjoyable.
"10 22, 2017",Love my Rav4,"We love this car.  Runs great, good gas mileage and dependable.  Lots of room.  Love the back seat laying down so we can carry things.  Would recommend."
"10 21, 2017",my first car,The car met all of my needs.  It is very comfortable for me. I am driving every day to my work and bask.
"10 21, 2017",Love my RAV4!',"This car is better than I expected! Meets all my needs and is a pleasure to drive. Highly recommended to family and friends. Dealership New Country Toyota, Westport CT, and especially Nick (sales) and Jessica (service)"
"10 11, 2017",Most reliable SUV on the market.,Most reliable SUV on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"09 16, 2017",Great AWD small SUV,"We wanted an AWD, small SUV with decent gas mileage and great reliability. This car checks all the boxes! We owned a Subaru Forrester in the past; it was good but not quite as reliable."
"09 10, 2017",Best alround car on the market,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)"
"09  6, 2017",Love all the safety options,I love the way this vehicle handles. It is very cost efficient with great fuel mileage. Love the roominess in the inside for a small SUV.
"09  6, 2017","RAV4 Limited -AWD, xtra security features, loaded!",Excellent reliable and top model car with technology package included.  Hard to find Limited models with the technology package and blizzard pearl exterior with two tone interior: black/cinnamon.
"09  3, 2017",Great small SUV,"Love this car, plenty of room, power when needed and good on fuel. I've owned several Toyota's and I like this one the most."
"08 29, 2017",So far so good,"I haven't owned the car long, but it has been a good car so far. I would recommend it to people looking for a good midsize vehicle."
"08 29, 2017",Really good suv,I think that's one of the best and most reliable car I've ever owned. I really like it. Never had any issues with it.
"08 22, 2017",Couldn't be happier with my choice,"This car fits all of my needs. The back seat offers great leg room suitable for my in-laws who are over 6ft tall. The dual-zone climate control is a great feature that is included in the XLE. Backup cameras come standard and are super helpful for safety and parallel parking. I feel so safe in this vehicle and have no worries when my wife drives to work. The seats can wear you down a little bit on road trips over 3 hours long. However, once you find the way you like the seat you won't have a problem; it took me one trip to figure out just how to adjust the seat to make it fit my needs perfectly. You won't regret buying this vehicle. Another plus is that you can get fuel economy of 30+ mpg on highway driving!"
"08 10, 2017",Rideshare customers love this vehicle,"As a senior citizen, this  vehicle and all the items I was looking for in a new car including  rear camera, side mirror turn signal's, plenty of cupholders, fog lamps.  Unfortunately, hybrid technology was not available in the RAV 4 in 2014.  Rideshare customers love the roominess and comfort of the vehicle, and so do I."
"08  7, 2017",I love this car!!!!!,This was the best car for me. I'm so happy I used the service to find the most ideal vehicle for me. I found everything I wanted in the car. Thank you thank you thank you!!!
"08  7, 2017",RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION,"YOU CANT BEAT A TOYOTA FOR ALL AROUND QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I ONLY FILLED UP THE GAS TANK EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND I DROVE AROUND A LOT."
"08  5, 2017",Love my Rav4,"I just purchased my Rav4 this week.  So far I couldn't ask for a better vehicle.  It is roomy, comfortable, smooth riding and just all around perfect for me."
"08  4, 2017",Love my Rav4!!,"I've just had it a few days, but I love it!!  I have been wanting one for a long time.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  Can't wait to travel with it."
"08  3, 2017","Spacious, sporty and fun","We test drove three different cars before landing on our RAV4. We chose it because of the options of Eco Mode and Sport Mode for driving, the AWD capabilities, the absolute comfort both front and back, the look, the interior, and of course the Toyota brand! So happy to have a Toyota back in my life!"
"08  3, 2017",Sound system computer died,I am very disappointed.  I had my car less than 5 months and the radio system went out and I was told I would have to pay 800 for a new one.
"08  3, 2017",Go For The Limited,"Love the drivability of the RAV4. Once I found one with a black exterior & then experienced the interior of a Limited trim level, it was all over. I knew I had found the perfect car for me."
"07 31, 2017",Most Stylish Car I've Owned,"I have driven RAV4s before, but never one this stylish. The interior has 2-tone softex leather-trimmed seats that are not only the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but also a thing of beauty!!! It handles incredibly well and, even though it is 3 years old, it looks and handles like a brand new car. Toyota's are the best!"
"07 28, 2017",Very fun to drice,"Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love it. It drives very well and has been very reliable so far. I really like the interior design"
"07 28, 2017",Sit back and enjoy the ride,Great features on the interior. Loved the power seats that were also heated seats. 2nd row seat that reclines. Perfect size for everyday commute.
"07 24, 2017",Best car to upgrade to!,"This car is the ultimate vehicle - lots of space/leg room, great mpg for an SUV, just overall the best car I've ever owned! Highly recommend the RAV4 to anyone looking for a new car, you will not be disappointed!"
"07 23, 2017",Has power,This vehicle has power and keeps it's value. It is a Toyota by the way.  Lots of cup holders!   Very cute Suv and very reliable
"07 13, 2017",It's a Toyota!,"This is my second RAV4 and fifth Toyota overall. First RAV4 (2009) I put over 120K on it with only routine maintenance and two sets of tires. Traded for a Subaru Impreza hatchback but was not happy with it (to small). Traded Subaru for 2014 RAV4 love the looks and the size very happy, I will never own anything but Toyota! Keep up routine maintenance and Toyota will last forever."
"07  2, 2017","New owner, a leased vehicle 2 years old. Used.",",Still getting used to it, my immediate negatives were lack of storage spaces around the cabin and arm resting places while driving.  Visually there are more blind spots than I am used to, but I say that is more my adjustment than the car.  Road noise is sort of  loud, but I hit a different patch of concrete and total silence.  Is it tires or something else?  I don't have a complaint about zippy, cuz the car will adjust to your desire. I had a Montero Sport 6 cyl with the same HP and had to drive  1200 Lbs more. Positives.  I like the Blue tooth,  radio controls on the steering column.  The fuel consumption meters, backup camera, and the SPACE OVERALL. One other thing is the dash trim has a reflective surface with the sun, sort of a chrome shine."
"06 23, 2017",Love it,"The Rav4 drives smoothly, is very comfortable and has awesome features. I would highly recommend it."
"06 15, 2017",my little dream suv,"Love the whole pkg...from color to size, comfort, gas mileage. sporty looking . The Interior being black and brown called Terracotta sealed my love for it."
"06 12, 2017",Great Reliable SUV at a great price,"I'm a tall fellow at 6'4"" and the Rav4 LE fits me just fine. The right console is designed just right so my knee can rest comfortably. The Safety features are great, as is the gas mileage for an SUV. The only cons that I've found so far is there is some road noise over rough surfaces and the lack of android auto/ability to show google maps on the LED screen for navigation."
"06  3, 2017",Nice interior and exterior plus reliable,I really like  toyota Rav4. It is nice exterior and nice interior even though some are disappoint me.
"05 31, 2017",Toyotas most reliable the only cars i buy,I love my RAV4 XLE  I am comfortable and its just the right size. I wish it had GPS and an alert signal for when I am going to change lanes.
"05 31, 2017",Very reliable stylish car,Very reliable stylish car. Excellent coverage under Toyota care. The car is very comfortable and spacious and suitable for road trips as it is good on mileage.
"05 30, 2017",2013 RAV4 XLE,"The RAV4 XLE is a great value for the money. Looking for a smaller SUV, this is it.  2013 and newer has so many more options, from Bluetooth to a backup camera."
"05 23, 2017",comfortable and sleek looking,"So far, love this car.
 Cars.com had a great variety in my area. Response was immediate.Dealer was informative and helpful. Made the purchase easy."
"05 23, 2017",Great styling and reliability,Reliable vehicle with spacious and well laid out interior. Good gas mileage. Put a hitch on it and planning to tow a small boat and installed bike rack.  Great family car.
"05 21, 2017",So far so good,Just what my wife needed! Easy to get in and out of! Plenty of room for grandkids and gardening hobby.....
"05 17, 2017",I am loving my choice!,"I was able to test drive three vehicles and purchased the Toyota Rav4 XLE! Love this vehicle! It handles well, very comfortable, nice interior and great on gas.  The navigation and bluetooth ability is definitely a plus! The ECO or Sport mode option when driving is excellent! One of my better decisions in purchasing a vehicle."
"05  3, 2017",Great car for the money,"I've only had this car for a little bit but so far it's been great.  Great on gas for a crossover SUV, looks sharp, handles well and has that Toyota reliability!  A lot more spacious than it looks from the outside.  The AWD will be handy once winter hits again in here in the midwest.  It is a quiet ride also!  Great little car all around.  So far so good."
"04 24, 2017",Somewhat disappointed,"I leased a standard model RAV4 three years ago, and when deciding whether to take the car I was bothered by dumb changes they have made to the interior, plus I wasn't thrilled with the exterior design either. And today I feel the same way. For instance, they moved the cup holders so that one is under the dash making it hard to get out. There is no longer a tray in the mid-seat compartment. There is still a compartment over the glove box, but they omitted the door that would go over it. There is no light over the front cup holder and adjacent areas. To turn on the overhead lights you have to feel around for a switch instead of just tapping on the light as before. Etc. All pretty annoying if you've owned an earlier RAV4. Door keys on the earlier model design you could easily feel the buttons, whereas the new style you cannot. I'm not crazy about the lift-up rear door, but that's just me. These things still annoy me after three years of having the car, so much so that I'm thinking of trading down to an earlier model. Performance is good, including the new transmission. It's still a good vehicle, I just think they made some real mistakes in the design. I would have given the car higher reliability rating if I had not had to do a near-complete brake job a few days ago."
"04 22, 2017",Navigation screen,I own a 2014 rav4 limitted. After 2 years of using the nav screen keeps on rebooting. When i went to toyota to have it fix but the cust service said that they cant fix the screen because it is not a toyota product I was so disappointed. My vehicle is out of warranty and im willing to pay for repair.  I will never go for toyota again.
"04 11, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,me and my family  love this car because Toyota is great. Thats why we love the rav4. It is really good for children
"04  1, 2017",Decent car,I had this car for three years. The road noise was loud but it drove really well in the snow!  Overall it was a good car but my family needed something bigger
"03 24, 2017","Excellent aerodinamic, economic in gas","Good I recommend it. If you can afford a hybrid, get it. very good in gas, excellent in sport mode if you wanna get away fast. The entertainment system is not good, cheap, a pain to upgrade, and only navigation in full loaded."
"03 10, 2017",RAV4 Limited,"I love this vehicle though I am open-minded. I am on the lookout for a similar/different vehicle that is very reliable, comfortable and has economical gas consumption."
"03  7, 2017",I had a RAV4 for 10 years. I love this one too,I had a 2006 RAV4 and then went to a Camry for the last year and a half. It was so low to the ground and just wasn't me. I love the room and comfort of the RAV4
"02 10, 2017",Toyota Rav 4 2014,Bought my rav 4 brand new in 2014 jan.1 year later i noticed colour change in my moulding looking like burnt patches.Filled a claim with Toyota which they declined to replace and told me i will have to pay for it.Now we are in 2017 the patches have continue to increase.Six months ago my radio just stopped working again i went to Toyota and reported all they said was i need to replace a new radio.It keeps reloading then goes off again and again.I have noticed this is a common problem with toyota.I am a very dissatisfied and disappointed customer.Am still paying for car.
"01  9, 2017",Radio Issues,My radio recently went out on my Toyota Rav 4. I haven't even owned  the vehicle for three years. I am over on miles so the warranty is void. The dealership wants 1200 dollars to replace my existing radio with a refurbished radio. I have checked the internet and this seems to be a defect with the system.
"12 19, 2016",2014 Red Toyota Rav4 LE,I bought my Toyota Rav4 as a certified Pre-Owned and it never disappointed me. The car is very smooth and definitely recommend to others.
"10 23, 2016",It's not a Porsche,"Awesome car for the money. If you are looking for top of the line quality leather, and you can't live without another cup holder, buy a Lexus. If you need speed,  buy a Porsche.  If you want style, and want to look like you know what you're spong, buy this Rav 4. And stop borrowing your grandmother's Buick!"
"09  1, 2016",Radio/Bluetooth,Have had my 2014 Toyota RAV 4 into the dealership 3 times with radio/bluetooth problems and it is still not fixed. The first time the radio was stuck on a station and I could not control volumn. Took it to dealership and they said it was a computer upgrade. Picked up the car and then the blue tooth was not working and constantly flashes connect/disconnect they said they fixed it again. Picked it up and still not working so took it back to dealer and they say they will replace the entire radio. Get it back with the new radio and still not working. Now they will not call me back to get it in again and it will be a week tomorrow since I picked it up and called them on 8/27/2016 saying it is still not working. Besides this problem they sold me a clear coat on the paint and scotch guard for inside and it seems like the paint chips even worse than any other car I've ever owned. The ride is not smooth and feels like you're in a truck when you go over bumps. I bought the car new in 2014 but I probably won't be hanging onto it for much longer.
"01  2, 2016",Rav4 a good bet,"I was shopping at end of year for 2013-2014 AWD vehicle with hatchback. I test drove the Subaru Outback , Toyota Rav4 Limited, Ford Escape SE and Titanius and Honda CRV touring. For the money and features the Toyota was the best buy. I will say the Honda was the smoothest ride and the Ford had the best engine performance. The Toyota was in-between these two for performance and comfort. The sport mode did give it better performance and the eco mode is nice for basic driving. Subaru Outback was not as good driving and I was surprised. Looking at the XLE and Limited in my view the Limited is worth it (~2-3K more on the used model). The limited has better seats and comfort. Also just more stand items included. Some have complained on the Bluetooth system. It works with my iphone 5 just fine and the dealer showed me a few tricks. The nav system is not the greatest, but not a big deal for me. since I like to use my phone anyway (included with limited so I have it). The interior lighting is a bit for for the switches but not a show stopper.

Things I really liked were visibility, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, drivers seat adjustments., AWD, handling and overall power."
"10  8, 2015",i hate this piece,I rented this car and I was NOT impressed. Everyone was saying the same thing.. S it has backseat recliners wow.. I would buy the Ford Escape or the X Trail or the CRV or something else I can't believe I rented this... I hate Toyota cars because they are extremely boring and timeless...Their parts are expensive and the don't last as long as you think
"09 30, 2015",2014 rav 4,Never enjoyed a day with my 2014 rav 4. So regretted buying it. The ride is the worst I have ever experienced causing my central nervous system to take a hit. Toyota says thats how they are built.
"09 25, 2015","Great vehicle, overall","I own a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD. Pros: Stable, comfortable ride with a relatively smooth and well-behaved 6-speed automatic transmission. Back-up camera is fantastic. Rear leg room is massive, especially compared to a sedan of equal length. The rear seats recline, which is great. The heated seats are phenomenal. The AWD system, brakes, and traction control make this vehicle feel extremely steady in poor, wintery conditions. It surprised me how well it all works. Cons: Cheap plastic around shifter lever. Rear styling is weird. The tail lights are odd-looking, and the button to release the rear hatch is far too high. Engine is very weak. I would have bought a V6 if it were still available. Overall, it's a great little SUV. It has a good balance of utility, size, and car-like handling. Just don't buy this vehicle if you're looking for something exciting to drive. It's not for people who value performance."
"09 16, 2015",Overated but Good Space and MPG,"Pros:
Nice Cargo Space for Mini SUV.
Good MPG.
Fairly quiet ride.

Cons:
Blind Spots due to High Metal doors and tailgate. Very Loud Interior Rumble when back windows are open. Uncomfortable seat after one hour of driving. Lack of true recreation assistance features. Lightweight aluminum doors dent very easily. Tailpipe and muffler hang down like they forgot to plan for it. No way to tie down tailgate when transporting large items with tailgate open. No way to shut off annoying beeper when tailgate is open. Tiny tiny arm rest storage box. Integrated voice calling and stereo need improvement.

Summary
A bit disappointed. I would not purchase a RAV4 again."
"08 31, 2015",terrible interioal finish,Just want to let every one knows rav4 has terrible and unacceptable defects in the interioal finish. to look at the joint between windshield and top and you can see how rough the job they have done.that is really unacceptable!!!!!!! looks just like junk !!! not understand why they made rav4 like this. I checked other cars there is no one make this joint like rav4
"08 17, 2015",Excellant car,"Lots of Space, great gas mileage, dependable, good dealer network. The wind noise very noticeable at freeway speeds specially when going over 75mph. But good outward visibility, smooth breaking, and powertrain is smooth and efficient"
"07  1, 2015",Unrepairable Air conditioner (AC),"Car is beautiful over all,
but it has stinky Air conditioner. And Toyota refuse to fix it under warranty. IT costs about 160$ every 3-4 months to have it deodorizer and change cabin filter."
"04  7, 2015",rav 4 negatives,"I purchased a 2014 rav4 on Nov 3, 2014. The xle model is great looking but not knowing the rating on the vehicle I did purchase the full 5yr 100,000 extra warraty. Now for the negatives as follows:
1. The speed indicator is off a solid two miles an hour and I hope I don't get a speeding ticket.
2. Too much glare on the screen in middle of dash.
3. This one makes me balistic - The bluetooth system really sucks, sucks, and sucks some more. I had it to the dealer and he said my problem is the brand of phone I have-bull ! I have a 2013 Chevy Silverado and the phone works the was it should on the bluetooth system so it's not my phone. This is how bad it is - When I receive a call after around two minutes the connectivety is lost and will not return until I pull off the road and shut the car off and wait two minutes and restart the car and then it returns. I don't care what brand of car from the most costly to the least that's just plain discusting. I was looking at a Chevy Equinox and only if I would have know I would be driving one. I will never buy another new car without test driving the bluetooth.
4. The dealer has the unliest dealer stickers ever that they put on the car and I just had to remove it."
"02 20, 2015",Lynch Toyota Manchester Ct,"I recently bought a 2014 Rav 4 LTD,
on the day I was picking up my Rav 4, Eduardo explained in great detail how to use Auto High Beam, Lane Departure Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and plus Entune Premium JBL Audio with Navigation Multimedia App Suite, and connecting my I Phone including my address book and music.
Yesterday had a problem with my music not connected, called and Eduardo was on a trip to New York, he called later in the afternoon, set up appointment in the evening and this problem was corrected in 5 minuets.
Lynch Toyota is very lucky to have this terrific person on
their team."
"01 11, 2015",Overall Pleased,"We rented this vehicle for a trip from Florida to California and back. We spent 3 weeks and 5800 miles in it. Two adults and probably 400 lbs of cargo. I found the gas mileage around home (35-55 mph with few lights) was around 34 mpg. On the road at 75 mph we got 27ish mpg on 10% ethanol and 28+ on pure gas. At 70 mph it gave 28.5ish on ethanol and 30-31 on real gas and at 65 it was 29 on ethanol and 32-33 on pure gas. Around L.A. (the city of cars & traffic) we averaged 24.5. Overall we got 28+ mpg. for the trip. 28 heading west and 28.5 going east. I found the wind affected the mileage greatly. For 2 adults it was fine. Rode comfortably. When the adult kids were with us we found issues with the back seat belts not wanting to release. The cup holders in the back are not very user friendly either. For my wife and I, I would consider buying one of these. If we had younger kids I would still consider it. For a family with teens, I'm not so sure. One thing I found I did not like but I got used to was the hood flexed and bounced around. I thought it wasn't latched tight, but it was."
"01  1, 2015",Love this SUV,"We really love this car and it's a Toyota. I worked at a GM dealer for 40 years as a mechanic so do know my cars. Previously owned a 2004 Pontiac Vibe which really was a Toyota Matrix with Pontiac badges. It was a fantastic car with no problems in 135,000 miles. Bad move GM as we loved the Vibe so much that when it came time to replace the Vibe GM had quit making them. We would have purchased a Matrix but Toyota quit making them also. Bad move Toyota. Had made up our minds to purchase a Subaru Outback but having seen way too many bad reviews on them using oil. Took a Rav4 for a test drive and loved it. Live in Montana and the AWD is amazing for getting around on the snow/icy roads. It gives almost too much confidence on how well it handles horrible roads. Was going tonight put snow tires on but it would have been wasted moneys because it goes anywhere with the factory highway tires. I could nitpick but all the great features make up for everything."
"12 20, 2014",Poor Cabin Design,"We are leasing a Rav 4. As with most cars you have to live with it a while to see short comings. The interior has many flaws, poor location for many switches which cannot be accessed without contortions. Very poor interior lighting, especially in the rear. The bottom of the doors collect mud and snow leaving your clothes a mess as well as the garage floor. No illumination for controls located on the door. The heated seats are not as effective as others I have owned. The gas tank is too small. The radio operation requires a Masters from MIT, hundreds of pages to the manual! I am glad I am leasing and not owning."
"10 23, 2014",My other Toyota experience is promising.,"This is a very good car for the money. Seems to be more economical than advertised. Practically noiseless, and well controllable."
"10 11, 2014",Navigation Blues,"I found the navigation screen almost impossible to use due to the glare. I have overcome this by using a $200. Garmin Nuvi, and stuck the suction onto a hockey puck then dropped the whole thing into the front cup holder. The power outlet is right there and the screen can be tilted toward the driver and is crystal clear regardless of bright sunlight. The puck fits snugly into the cup holder which is a convenient coincidence. As far as reading radio stations and other data, well that is still a problem for me, anyone got an idea?"
"10 10, 2014",Rav4 Ride!,Purchased 2014 Rav4 after comparing with other famous sports utility and been driving it for about 2 months now. Cabin is noisy and ride is bumpy!
"09 29, 2014",First time Toyota user,"this is the first time I have purchased a Toyota personally. I have had friends with them, but for me I have not owned one. So far, with the one month of use, I like the vehicle. I am a bit disappointed in the engine size but with time I hope to get use to it. On the highway it takes a bit to get the car moving..."
"09 23, 2014",Still learning,"Have owned the Rav4 for a month. We are very pleased with it so far. Ride and comfort are excellent. We are still learning what the car can do. The manual for electronics package alone is 200 pages. One small complaint, display screen is nearly flush with dash board and sometimes unreadable in bright sunlight."
"09 23, 2014",Nicest Car I have Ever Owned,"After reviewing rating online and consumer reports, I decided to see a Toyota Rav4 at the dealership. My husband and I found this vehicle to be everything we both were looking for in a sporty vehicle. Being that we like to do outdoor activities, Sunday drives, traveling, this vehicle provides everything we were looking for in a car. We purchase the XLE model that included the navigation. It has the sun roof, gps and other applications such as weather and traffic. It also has fog lights and many other features to make our trips enjoyable. We are very pleased with out purchase."
"09 18, 2014",bad MPG,"Dad MPG, this is my toyota, and i getting bad MPG 21 city; 26 hwy. love the radio and phone setup. at 4,000 miles. no problem."
"09 12, 2014",love my rav4,"It's really too early to give an impression of the things on the list, we just bought it yesterdqy. BUT, it was a replacement for a 2012 Rav 4 which was totaled in a MVA. Our 2012 was very reliable. Never had a bit of trouble with it. . I love Toyota!!"
"09  8, 2014",Make sure you're comfortable in the RAV4,"I've driven the RAV4 for about 1000 miles an overall I'm very happy, you as a prospective Rav 4 buyer compare the XLE and Limited for seat comfort. I find the armrest moves back-and-forth ""adjustable"" and sometimes is annoying and blocks the drink holder. Also a couple of the controls are in-conveniently placed above your left knee while sitting in the driver seat. I purchased the limited because I wanted blizzard pearl paint and I am very happy that I did I'm happy with all at this point after driving the thousand miles the liftgate is very convienient The pushbutton start is wonderful and the doorhandles lock and unlock is a very convenient feature. I would highly recommend the RAV4 for mileage and controls and drivability and I would recommend it to a friend"
"09  5, 2014",Good and bad.,"I just got a new 2014 RAV 4 Limited edition last month. I previously drove 2008 RAV 4 for 4 years and a 2012 Rave 4 XLE for 2 years. They are very reliable SUVs.

2014 RAV 4 Pro:
- Very reliable to drive during all season
- Easier to maneuver, turn and drive
- It has slightly better shock absorption capacity from uneven road than the previous models.
- Good mirrors that provide wider and better view of the road.
- Limited edition comes with lots of features, like back up camera, seat warmer etc.
- Good cargo space but less than the 2008 and 2012 models.
- Comes with two separate mats for winter and summer.
- Well priced for a SUV.

2014 RAV 4 Con:
- It has absolutely no leg space in the back passenger seats. It is impossible for normal height and tall people to seat comfortably at the back. It has less space than a normal sedan. The inside is tiny.
- The integrated software system for GPS and audio control is very bad and full of flaws.
- Consumes way more gas then the two previous models I drove.
- It has only two storage compartment at the front, smaller in size than the previous models. The previous models had multiple small compartments that were convenient to store things like sunglass, spare change for emergency and other electronic items like phones out of sight. The 2014 model have none of these. The compartment they made to keep phone is out in the open and every time the car stops even decelerating gradually, it slips and falls on the floor.
Overall, Toyota made 2014 RAV 4 cheap by cutting out all the useful, convenient little things. If you had a previous model with good features, don't change to this new model. If you are buying a RAV 4, buy a previous model with added features. I drove 2008 and 2012 models; they are very good, reliable cars with a better fuel mileage. If I had a Limited edition of 2012 RAV 4, I definitely would have kept it.
Good luck!"
"09  5, 2014",Third Toyota I've Owned,"I've been very satisfied with all 3 Toyotas I've had. I chose the RAV 4 because I needed a car large enough to hold a big dog crate (with the backseats down), but didn't want a huge SUV.
Had the car less than a month, but have been really happy with it."
"08 28, 2014",To Purchase or Not Purchase,"I own a 2014 XLE AWD. I've read the reviews and here are my thoughts:

Likes:
Flat, big cargo space for a little SUV.
MPG is what they claim... Hwy 29-32, City 24-28.
Bluetooth handless phone capability.
Control panel on steering wheel.

Dislikes:
Uncomfortable seat and head rest.
Blind spots due to high door design.
Heated seat option not available.
Glare on monitor screen.
Feels like a high center of gravity. Not stout.
Muffler and pipes visible.
Yes, the hood does bounce.
Funky cruise control post.
Lack of comfortable driver arm rests.
Yes, there is a vibration with windows open.
Unable to activate/deactivate all interior lights with one switch.

Recommendation:
I can't recommend this vehicle primarily because the seats are uncomfortable and there are too many blind spots due to high door design."
"08 22, 2014",Just fine,"I've owned this car for a month - 2014 xle. Purchased this over the Mazda CX-5 because of the price alone (Toyota has bargaining power. Mazda doesn't at this point). I've owned a lot of Toyotas and they all drive pretty much the same. The second I drove this car, I felt comfortable. It responds well, it feels exactly like other toyotas I've owned. I'm not, however, blown away. There is a crazy glare on the screen. I'm technologically savvy and the computer system organization doesn't make any freaking sense. I've read the manual, spent more time than I have on candy crush personalizing the navigation, and I still can't get a seamless experience when driving. The voice command doesn't understand me and I've tried to calibrate it multiple times. Other issues - I have to step back every time I open the back door and there aren't enough storage compartments (I used to own a 2 door Yaris with more small-storage space than this car). Those things aside - it's a toyota and has AMAZING resell value (My yaris depriciated $200 in 5 years) and amazing reliability and my dealer has a great service department. I'm not crazy about this car, but for the money and the company, it's a great choice."
"08 16, 2014",I Love my Rav 4,It's sporty and responsive. I can't imagine owning anything else. Everyone that has looked at it will be considering the Rav 4 for their next vehicle. Toyota makes such a great product!
"08 13, 2014",Best car that I can see out of really good,I can see out of this vehicle all around and love the backup camera.It rides a little like a truck but it has big wheels so that is probably the reason.All in all I like this vehicle.
"08  9, 2014",Overall excellent...some disappointments,"I bought this car to replace a well used and loved 2006 Highlander. The mileage in the RAV4 is substantially higher. It is not quite as large, but will do the job.

I've been driving it for almost a month and following are my comments.

Disappointments:
1. Noisy, jumpy ride
2. Terrible radio
3. No remote opener for garage doors (on top model)
4. No space for sunglasses and other odds and ends
5. Non locking glove compartment (!)
6. Overly complex electronics
7. Hard seats
8. Would like stronger headlights (as I have aged, my eyes get worse at night vision)

What I like:
1. It's a Toyota (dependable and effecient)
2. Nice looking vehicle
3. Decent cargo capacity
4. Power liftgate (reason I didn't consider CRV)"
"08  6, 2014",RAV 4,"Better equipment and technology than a Honda CRV. Trying to get adjusted to a smaller vehicle (sold Ram1500 4X4 Quad Cab) Not a solid as the Rm but better mileage. Choice was between Ford Edge, CRV and RAV4. Edge & RAV4 equal except in price."
"08  3, 2014",Good SUV,"I have owned Toyotas for last 25 years and happy with the performance. With basic maintenance, never had any major problems. New RAV-4 Limited has lots of options that normally I expected in Lexus or luxury car.
Navigation, Backup camera, Blind spot, Lane designation, etc. makes it easy to drive. Ride is not very comfortable as car or van but I expected that being SUV."
"07  9, 2014",Not so pleased,"After driving a 2011 Nissan Rogue, I purchased a RAV4 basically for the looks and Toyota's rep on quality. Trading it in. The seats are hard and uncomfortable and the ride is like a wagon. I can feel every bump! I purchased the XLE and even though it has back up camera, bluetooth, etc, NO electric seats, no sunglass case. I couldve done without the sunroof for electric seats and a better ride!!!"
"06 16, 2014",Realistic Review,"6/16/2014

This is an objective and realistic review from a person who has owned a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD for two weeks and has completed several 300 mile trips. Male, 5'8"", 180 lbs, age 50.

PROS

- Hwy MPG averaging 31.
- Cargo Space is larger than competition.
- Voice activated Bluetooth cellular functionality.
- Voice and Hand activated stereo functionality.
- Seems like a quiet smooth ride.
- Front seat side cushions are comfortable.
- AWD availability.
- Reliable track record.

CONS

- Nowhere to rest elbows during driving. Uncomfortable. Try it.
- Seat is hard an uncomfortable after 2 hours.
- No neck support...There is a monster head support that doesn't adjust well, but why can't mfgrs make a nice neck support!!
- Very very loud rumble/vibration if rear windows are open during driving.
- Can't read air/heat temperature because the mounting plate is tilted toward sunroof reflection.
- New ""sleek"" design is less functional providing less cargo space and access for large items.
- More door height and less window... personal preference to have more window, less door panel.
- Heated seats not available...Come on gang!!!

I believe the 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD is more ""sporty"" than comfortable and is targeted to the younger generation. I believe the focus is to attract this market with a ""sleek"" design and bells and whistles provided thru the monitor screen. Most of the mini SUV mfgrs appear to be copying each other with this new design.

Personally, I prefer to have more cargo space than a ""sleek"" design so I can fit things into my mini SUV. The loveseat I recently purchased won't fit because they tapered off the back end. Otherwise, it would have fit. I would also prefer more seat comfort, elbow rests and neck rest! If you want comfort, make sure you test drive it several times. The Honda CRV seemed more comfortable but had less cargo area. It is a nice looking vehicle and has some bells to play with, but try to look beyond looks and whistles if you also desire functionality and comfort."
"05 30, 2014",Not as good as CRV,"Rav-4 no sunglass holder, front hood has sun glare, does not take bumps and potholes as good as Honda CRV,rear child locks needed. Leased will tolerate for few years."
"05 29, 2014",Toyota rav4 is the best SUV,If you are on the market for a SUV you can not go past the rav4 becomes it is not that expensive to by and it has a grate re-sale value. Also if you are looking for a SUV that can be used for mol table courses such as for off roading or for camping or for local city driving well I recommend this is the perfect car for you.
"05 26, 2014",one of the most reliable cars i have owned,"viewing excellent, dual air conditioning in front, bluetooth hands off to control phone, and radio, power sun roof, new styling front fenders and rear lights. great car probably the last car I will buy!!!"
"05 20, 2014",First brand new car,It is my first brand new car. I feel so relax by driving it. I definitely love my new Toyota Rav4 and I will recommend my friend to buy it.
"05 19, 2014","Happy with Wellesley Toyota, Wellesley MA","I am very happy with TOyota RAV4. It has a beautiful exterior in greay and the interior is also impressive.

What impressed me was the Sales Manager who sold me the car. He was one of the best representatives of any Toyota dealer I've gone to, Martin Hansberry of Wellesley Toyota explained the features of several makes and i am very happy with his suggestions. We negotiated for a price and I was very happy with our final agreement. I had prevously gone to another dealer in Framingham and was very dissatisfied even though I had purchased three other new Toyotas from that same dealer, Their offer was insulting and I will never go back.
Happily Wellesley Toyota makes me a customer for life.."
"05 17, 2014",great car,"After looking at the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester I decided on the Rav 4. I own 4 Camrys for a business and sold an older one last year with 249,000 miles. Toyota reliability speaks for itself. I got the LE with roof rack, mats and mud flaps. Rides nice with wrap around seats. Great gas mileage compared to my trade in 2003 6 cyl. Mazda Tribute. Engine has plenty of power. Sound system is great with Bluetooth and IPOD capability. I removed the rear seat passenger headrest for better visibility when I don't have passengers. But mirrors are positioned well. Looking out the front window over towards the passenger side front area takes some getting use to as the fender is flared upwards. Would recommend this to a friend for sure"
"05 15, 2014",2014 Rav 4 LE......seat comfort,"Regarding the 2014 RAV 4 LE:
Recently test drove it, then purchased it. Does any one else feel a springy band across the seat cushions which bounces into your butt when you drive? This is a really weird feeling! and it's right under your butt! It appears to be in all the seats, but I feel it especially in the front bucket seats.
If I felt it before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
"05  8, 2014",Fabulous!,I absolutely love my brand new Rav 4! I am 62 yrs. old and this is my first brand new car and I feel like a queen! It has everything I need in it and more! It drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage! I would definitedly tell my friends to buy one of these!
"05  5, 2014",Reliability,"Love my Rav 4 so far, especially the flexibility of drive modes. Very important to save on fuel. Will reserve final review after I drive through snow!"
"05  3, 2014",2012 Rav 4,"My 4th Toyota, 1st SUV, 1st preowned car. Absolutely love it! Was nervous about preowned, but it's an excellent car. Of course, it's Toyota!."
"05  3, 2014",good value,"I have owned 7 new Toyota's over the years and am constantly amazed at how they choose the ""standard"" features for each model. They don't seem to make any common sense. For example. My new RAV-4 XLE comes with a standard power sunroof which I might use 2 times as year! I would rather have the 8-way power seat which my wife and I would use every day!
Also the placement of the electric outside driver mirror switch is in a difficult location to operate. I have to look down towards the floor and to the far left, totally away from the road. I have to pull over and stop just to change the angle of the mirror! Also to operate the radio is a nightmare, I have been through the manual but cannot understand how to lock in a new station. What ever happened to just turning a knob and pushing a button? It's crazy!"
"05  1, 2014",Tuff for my gsd,"The only things I don't like
1. No Keyless trunk open (offered on limited, but had to get leather seats to get limited)
2. Got to ""pump"" yah seat up w a lever on side. Not electric.
I"
"04 27, 2014",Hooked on Toyota,"This review is based solely on dealer test drives, therefore my ratings on this RAV4 are limited. However, something may need to be asked about driver visibility on this vehicle. I am over six feet and yet when I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful SUV, I see all hood and no road. Even with a height adjustment, this unfortunate design still exists. I owned a 2003 RAV4 and I remember its selling point to me was the clarity of vision while sitting behind the wheel. Am I the only one reacting this way? My wife and I want to buy this vehicle but this is an issue that troubles us. Any thoughts on this?"
"04 23, 2014",nice car,FOCUS ON THE VEHICL'E FEATURES AND BE SPECIFIC. DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEFORE REVIEWING IT. INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE AND SPECIFIC DEALERSHIP.
"04 19, 2014",thought we liked it not at all,we leased 2013 xle its ok ride is terrible accelerates terrible no power very cheap interior not real happy had it for a year wish we got a camry highlander I think were paying to much for that vehicle to
"04 15, 2014",poor Rav-4,This is the worst SUV that i have ever brought...it has not space and have a really bad 4-wheel drive
"04 13, 2014",Updates on 2014 RAV 4,"Back cargo area has insufficient lighting ( adding ) more of my own. Radio control panel/Navigation impossible to use in certain sunlight, Not just a little. Also, some switches behind and lower of steering are very difficult to use because steering wheel blocks them out. Like the cars. but these three things are very irritating to me,. And I think the 2 year, 25,000 mile warranty would have been a deal breaker if I was thinking more clearly."
"04 12, 2014",Two Weeks from Purchase,"I had a tough time in deciding between the Terrain and the RAV4, but more acceleration (translating safety) and wife's comfort in the seats was the final determinant. Previously owning a '06 Camry also pointed toward reliability. Last weekend we took a round trip of about 400 miles, and I perceived a much stiffer ride than that of the Camry, although it is quite nimble in handling, and quieter. I did notice that on bumpy roads the hood vibrated, especially along the back leading edge. (Perhaps I am too picky.) Investigation revealed just a flexible plastic ""support"" structure under this edge, no steel, so no bolstering pad can be applied under the hood there. This design flaw should be ameliorated.

The transmission shifts well, but the audio controls are a bit confusing for old folks, even though we are computer literate.

Would I buy it again after this two weeks of driving experience? Probably, but its just like getting married - its going to take a while to adjust to the changes, and to really KNOW, although you have committed for life."
"04  9, 2014",Perfect starter SUV,"This is a lux, easy to use and drive ""starter"" SUV. It has a comfortable ride and it feels sturdy and safe. I appreciate that it has an eco and sport mode, and it comes with a lot of upgraded features even in the base LE. My only complaint is the touch screen. I wish it was either angled to the driver or had a small lip or visor over it as when the sun is out it becomes very hard to read."
"04  8, 2014",Smooth Driving Machine,This is a reliable crossover/SUV with a lot of inner space and comfort for front row and back row passengers.
"04  7, 2014",Great vehicle,Very pleased with this RAV 4!!!!!!! Bought the limited after not planning for anything past the XLE. Turned out to be a great decision! Highly recommended!!!!'mm
"03 22, 2014","nice vehicle, but not totally satisfied","This review is on the 2014 Rav4 Limited Edition.
While the exterior and interior are great to look at....I have some reservations on the vehicle regarding majority of the interior.
1. My #1 complaint is about the touchscreen radio. I wear polarized sunglasses (to minimize glare) but when the sun hits the screen...I can't see ANYTHING on the touchscreen radio!! I have to take my glasses off and then I can KIND of see. They should make the touch screen anti-glare or something because even when not wearing my sunglasses, when the sun hits the screen it is VERY difficult to see anything.
2. There are NO INTERIOR LIGHTING in the glove compartment, center console, or cargo area!!!! So, when it's night time and I have to get something from the glove box or center compartment I have to use the lighting from the top by the rear view mirror. And if I have to get anything in the cargo area at night...forget about it!!! I can't see anything, so I have to get out a flashlight or use my cell phone to look around. Granted, I do have black interior but still...at the very least wouldn't you think that there'd be SOME kind of lighting for the cargo area?!
3. There are very few interior compartments and the center console is pretty shallow compared to other vehicles I've had. At the very least, for the limited edition they could have included a compartment for your glasses. I find myself having to stuff everything into one place since there's such limited room. My smaller Honda Civic had wayyy more compartments and little nooks than this bigger size Rav4.
4. I'm sure they added all of the plastic pieces to the vehicle to save $. It would've been nicer without it, but of course it would've been much more expensive.
Aside from all of that...I will say, the vehicle is a beauty to look at. I really like the different things you can do with the radio, change settings to certain things to fit what you want, and I absolutely love the heated seats. The ECO mode and the SPORT mode are interesting...but I honestly don't feel too much of a difference. The vehicle is very smooth to drive and I'm hoping to be keeping it around for another 10+ years!"
"03 20, 2014",Love my Rav4,Just traded in my 2005 Rav4 for a new 2014 one. Love the interior and the comfort. The outside is beautiful. Interior features I did not know was in there. As always it drives so smoothly and effortlessly. Would not of traded in my old Rav4 but the new features on the new one will make my life easier. I never had a problem with the old one and am sure I will experience the same high quality on the new Rav4.
"03 19, 2014",Can't beat a Toyota,"Out of the other cars in this class that I looked at, I like the fact that the RAV4 sits up a bit higher. I also like that the spare wheel is no longer mounted on the hatch door but located inside, I also like that the hatch door rises up, versus opening from left to right. Much easier for loading/unloading to have the door out of the way.

The back seats fold down fairly flat. I don't have to remove the head rests or move the front seats up any.

I wish that Toyota had kept the lock on the glove box, but I guess they have to reduce costs somewhere. The inside styling is a little more functional and looks nice. The rear view camera is a nice addition.

I love the hands-free calling thru the radio. The sound quality is very good. No more tunnel sounds or wind-rushing sounds on the other end. Easy to set up and use. The voice activated calling is great. I was very surprised. I also like that Pandora, when open on my phone, automatically streams thru the radio as soon as I turn on the ignition.

I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but so far it is great.

The only drawback at this point, is the cloth seat has a seam indentation near the seat-back. At first I thought this was a defect in the cushion, but soon discovered that it is the style of the seat. It is kind of strange to get used to at first, but I'm sure eventually I'll forget about it.

The heated air takes about 5 minutes to warm up when the car is cold, and is not super hot, but adequate to stave of the cold. I find in general, that Toyotas take a bit longer to reach a hot air temperature, compared to other brands.

I also find that I have to be careful to shut the door firmly, otherwise the latch catches, but the door isn't shut all the way. Several times I have failed to shut either the hatch or side doors properly and have to open and re-shut them. Only a minor nuisance.

By the way, this review is based on the LE, automatic transmission. I really wanted the heated seats, but did not want to sacrifice the 3inches of head space for the sun-roof. I think it is a great car and will give me many years of satisfaction."
"03 10, 2014",Love my RAV4!,"I purchased a Camry XLE in December 2013. I HATED it. So, after 2 months of driving it I traded it in for a 2014 RAV4 XLE. It was so worth it. I love everything about this car. I love the way it looks, the interior styling and features, the exterior, the technology, the way it drives-it's *exactly* what I wanted in a new vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it. The *one* thing I do wish it had more of is interior compartments/storage nooks-like a coin compartment or a compartment for my sunglasses. That's the only thing it lacks.
I am so glad that I didn't waste any more time with the Camry and got my RAV4.
I couldn't be happier with it!"
"03  8, 2014",Glad I Purchased,"I originally test drove this car based on a friend's recommendation. He has an older model RAV4 and is pleased with it.

I have been driving my new RAV4 for approximately one month, and I am enjoying it! The only reason for 4 stars in the ""Comfort"" category is that I find that when getting into the driver's seat, I have to make sure to be positioned perfectly (for me) or, if driving for an extended period, I begin to get somewhat uncomfortable. I think that this problem will go away as the car and I ""get used to each other"", so not a biggie in the downgrade department.

One review I read (before buying) did not think the car had fast enough acceleration when in the ""eco"", or efficient gas mode. However, I keep it in ""eco"" all the time and have not had any trouble safely accelerating while entering highway traffic. Also, my latest MPG was 26 combined town and highway, with more local than highway driving.

In short....I love this vehicle and think Toyota has done an outstanding design job! I can't think of an item they may have overlooked."
"03  5, 2014",Love my Rav4,"I've had my car for over a month and really love it. The seats are comfortable and everything is within reach when driving. The blue tooth does not work as well as I wish it did, but I bought the car for its reliability and safety. So far I am getting better gas mileage than my 2007 Camry (it was a v6). The drive is smooth and if I want a little more kick, I can change from the eco setting to the sport setting. If I could change anything, I wish the back window was a little larger and that I could get more visibility out of it especially when trying to zip in and out of traffic. Other than that, it's a winner."
"03  5, 2014",My favorite car of all time,"This is my third Rav4. I owned a 2001 and 2005 Rav4 previously. I needed a bigger car in 2008 and the Sienna felt a little small. I purchased a 2008 Chrysler Town & Country. What a mistake that was, I had nothing but problems from the day I purchased it. It is a beautiful car but poorly built. I have NEVER had a problem with my Rav4's so I went back to that. It is the best car ever!!!
Thank you Toyota!
Catherine"
"02 25, 2014",Over & above my expectations!,"My family has always had Fords, but we wanted to try a lease and had seen the good deals on the Toyota Rav 4 - went to Spitzer in Monroeville and dealt with Jim Yoxall - he was excellent! He took the time to explain the lease to us, and answer any questions we had on the car, it was over and above all my expectations! It handles so smoothly, ride is extremely comfortable, has many features and has done wonderful on gas mileage for us. The car has done extremely well in the bad weather we have recently had in PA, and I would highly recommend this car! If anyone is unsure of a Toyota take a trip to Spitzer and ask to talk to Jim and see what a good deal and exceptional vehicle hecan put you in. I will definitely return to Spitzer to deal again when our lease is up."
"02 19, 2014",Great experience,I recently bought a Rav 4 from a salesmen by the name of Shawn. He was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. I had a great experience and I feel like everyone should know.....Go see the boys of Lakewood Toyota!!
"02 14, 2014",Fun and Sassy to Drive,"This vehicle has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Just turned 10K miles. Fun to drive and a wow factor too. I purchased it for local, run around yet overall smaller than the previous Sienna . It fit those profiles. Now, unexpectedly I've had to make to long haul trips (750 mi) each way and guess what? Quiet, smooth, exceptional handling and good gas mileage too. These I did not expect with a small SUV. The ""sport mode"" really gives this little engine some get up and go! Usually drive in the economy mode though. I do wish I had bought the auto rear deck opener. I think a good value with Toyota quality included."
"01 30, 2014",Good Reliable compact SUV for my daughter,Good and nice small compact SUV for daughter. so she can go to college and work.good gas milege and saving money
"01 16, 2014",my 2014 not as good aS OUR 2011,"OUR 2014 DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR 2011

BUT WE DO LIKE THE MISSING OUTSIDE SPARE
THE SEATS COULD USE MORE PADDING
THIS ONE DONT HAVE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS"
"01  7, 2014",Third New Toyota,"Toyota's have always given me excellent service. They are reliable, well- built and affordable.Sales staff highly professional and courteous. Volunteered information and advice that made purchase experience very enjoyable."
"12  5, 2023",rav4 very gud,"Overall, the RAV4 is a great car for commuting, families of four, and space. The RAV4 is the best when it comes to reliability. The RAV4 is very spacious in the second row and the trunk and the car offers comfortable seats. The RAV4 gets okay fuel economy but it does do decent in the snow. However there are some things that it lacks. The RAV4's navigation system is very frustrating to use, just use google maps instead. The RAV4's interior quality is not that great either, there are tons of fake buttons and plastic throughout the interior, but no one who buys a RAV4 cares about the interior. The RAV4 has decent styling, but it is not as stylish as the Mazda CX-5. The RAV4 only has 1 engine option, but does not feel underpowered. The RAV4 also doesn't have a very quiet or comfortable ride. Even though the seats are comfortable, the ride is loud and the inside rattles frequently. If you don't care about luxury and want a practical, reliable car, the RAV4 is perfect."
"07 26, 2023",Very Reliable!!,I absolutely am in love with my Rav! The gas mileage is great! I have owned my Rav for years! I just turned over 100000 miles on it. I have not had any big problems with it at all! They don't make cars like this anymore! My RAV is so very reliable!  It also does super great in the snow as well!
"06 28, 2023",THE BEST NEW CAR EVER PURCHASED BY ME!!!,"Owned a silver 2014 Rav 4 XLS for 9+ years now. The best car I have ever owned to date just required to do regular oil and filter changes 2 brake jobs and routine maintenance. Very good on gas consumption compared to my GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherooke!"
"07 15, 2022",Not recommend for anybody,My stereo system keep showing loading signals and then blackout. It’s completely not working. Called Toyota made a complaint and no solution. Lots people having the same issue. They have to have a recall on that. Worst customer service in Toyota. I will never buy it. I will not recommend Toyota to anybody either
"03  3, 2022",Toyota RAV4 2014,"Best cat I've ever had almost up to 450,000 Kilometres and have had no problems. It's never broke down and the Sports mode is a Beast."
"04  8, 2021",Toyota is for everv and reasonable price,It’s a good car reliable comfort easy to use and drive trustable  smooth spacious three option of speed and low gas consumtion per hundred mile.
"03 31, 2021",Best car I've owned since 1982,This car is simply fabulous in every way!!!!! :)  I feel safe and comfortable and I finally have a radio that works! Could not be happier.
"09 14, 2020",Very fast,I love my car it the ride fit for mi and my family and is good in gas too and very comfortable nice in side
"08 18, 2020",The best car I've owned.,"Toyota RAV4 is a very good compact SUV, and it's easy to see why it's one of the best-selling nameplates in the United States. It delivers impressive fuel economy and comes loaded with plenty of standard features. This Toyota also has an upscale, roomy interior."
"07 19, 2020",Nicest used Cari have ever owned.,This car net all my needs. As a tall-ish guy this car offered a lot of interior room and leg space. It has great gas mileage and handles nicely.
"07 14, 2020",Once I go back  home for good I will buy the same!,"This car was very good for me. I need to sell it Because I'm going back home for good. I will buy the same car for sure!
Money saver.. only 4 cylinder!"
"03  4, 2020",Great value in a sport ute,"Styling, comfort and reliability fully met Toyota expectations.  Fuel economy is a bit less than hoped, but security of 4x4 drive in severe Winter conditions worthwhile.  It’s everything from a grocery getter to regular commuter.  Even gets occasional light duty off-road use on fishing and hunting trips."
"02 27, 2020",Never Letting this one go!!,"I got my 2014 in late 2017 as I was in the process of a divorce and working 2 jobs. Traded in my 2012 Corolla for this. The Vechile is now 6 years old and the suspension and steering still feel like brand new, mine is a base model LE with a Sport and Eco Mode. The Eco Mode on mine I find to limiting, (best if you’re going on a long trip with a low speed limit not during Rush hour at best.) Sport Mode on the other hand is a dream come true driving. The Interior after helping my mom boy her ‘13, my ex-husband buy a ‘15 and my best friend buy a ‘17 does feel a bit on the cheaply made side.  But apart from that it’s wonderful! My Rav has AWD, Traction control, and (thankfully it became standard) a backup camera."
"01 29, 2020",Great vehicle,Great vehicle with lots of room. It is easy to drive and handle. Has lots of room in back for wheelchair or other needed items.
"01 28, 2020",Third RAV4 in the family,"Just purchased a used '11 RAV4 for our daughter to join the '04 and '14 RAV4s already in the family. Great reliability, good gas mileage, compact/easy to maneuver and park, good safety...what's not to like. Because I'm a large guy, slightly bigger seats would be nice, but hardly a show-stopper. Also, I really enjoy all of the additional ""luxury"" items included in my '14 Limited edition, e.g., AWD, blind side monitor, back-up camera, XM radio, heated seats, bluetooth, auto headlights."
"01 21, 2020",2014 RAV radio issues,"My 2014 Rav 4 stereo just went out!!  The bluetooth began to kick on and off a few days ago,  I thought is was issues with my phone."
"01  8, 2020",Meet my expectation in every way,"I owned this car since 2014. The front seat at least for a smaller person (5'6"") is comfy, though an adjustable lumbar support would make the seat better.Engine power is enough to easily get up to speed on most interstate ramps.  Gas mileage is not better than advertised except on long flat runs in the mid 60 mph range, then I get 35mpg or better.  This car has very usable load room. I had many long trips with family and it's best car."
"01  5, 2020","Attractive, functional, reliable, affordable",The perfect car for getting around town comfortably.  Comfortable ride and lots of room inside.  Brand new tires and battery.  Very solid gas mileage and handles great city or highway.
"12 21, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,This car met all my needs. I absolutely love it. It is beautiful on the inside and outside. I am so glad I chose a Rav4.
"11 25, 2019",Good investment for 30k,"This car is reliable, durable, well made for small family or single person. Trunk space is adequate. Features plentiful. The car handles well in highway traffic. Gears change smoothly. Ride is comfortable. One car seat is goid and two would be capacity."
"11 21, 2019",Great all purpose vehicle,"Excellent suspension and road compatibility.  Easy to handle and delivers a smooth, comfortable ride. My wife especially loves the RAV feeling very safe while driving it."
"11  4, 2019",Love the  performance o and reliability of Toyotas,Thi vehicle is not new to us. We just upgraded from a 2009 to a 2014 in the same color etc. We like the reliability.
"10 27, 2019",Excellent Value,This car is very nice and comfortable. For the value you can’t find a better car like RAV4. They are reliable and make a great family vehicle.
"09 27, 2019",Versatile and Reliable,"Full disclosure:  I used to sell Toyota, Buick, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks.  For my money, Toyota offers extreme reliability at a reasonable cost. My 3014 RAV4 was Toyota Certified with 35,000 miles on the odometer.  Two and a half years later the RAV4 has 90,000 plus miles. The SUV still runs and looks like new. I have done only routine maintenance, replaced original equipment tires with Michelins and replaced the radio with a Kenwood model that featured Apple CarPlay. This RAV4 was as close to a good investment as any car or truck I ever purchased."
"06 10, 2019",5 years never any mechanical issues. Great car!,"I am a big guy. This car is very comfortable to drive with plenty of legroom. Family loves it for long trips to the mountains and beach.  Also plenty of room in the trunk for all my families grocery, toys and if you need even more room like bringing home 20 bags of bark from the garden supply store just make rear seat flat."
"05 20, 2019",It’s Toyota got to be reliable! Enjoying the Ride,"This car meets our needs very reliable comfortable ride ! Great on gas, would recommend same vehicle to friends and family . For a used vehicle and of course a Toyota you know your getting a great car. The 2014 Rav 4 is great and it was a one owner car well taken car of we are now a Toyota family along with my Tundra. Looking to purchase another Tundra or Tacoma soon and passing my used Tundra down to my son."
"04 13, 2019",best car i vere owned,this car meets our need good leg room good gas mileage lots of power rear seats lay down for extra cargo space sun roof towing package if you need it
"04  8, 2019",Very nice vehicle I love it,This vehicle was just what I was looking for. I have owned Volvo’s  this vehicle is just as nice and very easy to drive  love it
"03 27, 2019",Great vehicle,"Plenty of room, easy to get in and out of.  Seats are comfortable.  Love the back up camera, the Bluetooth feature easy to handle and good on gas"
"02  9, 2019",Things gone bad,Radio quit working after warranty expired.  Car was less than 3 years old.  Toyota is not standing by their product and won't replace it even though this is a common problem.  Now transmission fluid is leaking.  Car is a lemon!
"01 30, 2019",Pontiac vibe,You cannot go wrong with the Toyota engine very dependable good on gas all wheel drive is the way to go with the 1.8 engine
"01  9, 2019",I like RAV4 limited owsam. Car I like everything,Really good family car  it has all the features that we need to make our life luxury  plus previous owner installed Remot Startar  i recommend everyone one to buy limited rav4
"01  2, 2019",Toyota reliability is nearly unmatched,"I purchased this vehicle to be my personal take me to the mountains, rivers, golf course, etc.  It has been totally reliable and given good comfort doing it.  On long trips I get better than advertised gas mileage."
"12 23, 2018",Disappointing!,"Too many issues...been serviced only at  Griffin ...radio/stereo quit working and all door locks do not work!!  Only 41,000 miles!!!!  Very dissatisfied and disappointed in problems and cost to tepair issues that should have not even been an issue with such a new car!!!"
"12  5, 2018",Lots of road noise,When we drove it a little sluggish when asked to get up to freeway speed and enough road noise anyone in the back seat couldn't hear.
"11 27, 2018",coolest most reliable car I have owned !!!,I needed a car that was AWD and simple - this rides on the snow like a snow mobile especially if you add snow tires...gas mileage is great and style is perfect for me !!! I love em' so much I bought a second !!!
"11  4, 2018",Most best value car i ever owned,This car exhibited all my needs. One of the best value price car. Design is really great. Very comfortable car. Most successful car from Toyota for the reasonable price
"10 15, 2018",reliable and lots of room,"This vehicle has definitely met my needs being roomy, all wheel drive and I am able to use the racks on top for transporting my kayaks  and by the way, I love the color."
"10  2, 2018",Can't compare to any other small SUV,"We looked for several other cars before getting this RAV4. We compared to a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and Honda CRX. But none of those cars compares to our Toyota. We love how smooth it is to drive, how fuel efficient it is, the cargo space has no comparison and even though we own an LE (lowest trim), the interior is very comfortable, and it has almost every accommodation that the competitors' mid trims have (except the automatic lights)"
"08  8, 2018",A nice and reliable car to own,It is really good for me with all my needs. I will buy the newest model to have the best and latest accessories every one is longing for.
"07 18, 2018",Zippy dependable commuter and traveling vehicle.,Owned the car for four years.  I love how it handles and quickly accelerates.  The ride could be smoother and quieter.  I never had to take it to the shop for anything other than maintenance.
"06 27, 2018","Easy to buy, own, resell","On second RAV4. Great mileage for an SUV non-hybrid. Excellent acceleration in Economy mode, never mind Sport. Roomy enough for four adults . Lots of storage."
"06 23, 2018",We are a Toyota Family,This was an easy choice.  Toyota is a great brand and we know we can always count on the car!!  Thanks for being there for the family.
"06 22, 2018",Versatility is the best of all cars owned.,"This car has usability that prior cars could never equal, with the rear seats being able to push all the way down flat. This allows extending the cargo area enough to carry items most cars would not be able to. Yet, it's smaller in length, so it fits nicely into smaller spaces."
"06  4, 2018",Most comfortable Automobile I have owned.,"I found myself in need of a vehicle that will perform well in snow due to job location change.
The Rav4 has exceeding my expectations for comfort and has performed very well in snow.
My job is at one of the higher elevations and at the top of the hill...I see many vehicles sliding
when it snows and I have had no problem at all."
"05 30, 2018",Disappointed but I don?t hate the car,I wish I shopped around more and looked and more cars in the same class. It took me a little while and I started to find this this car really lacked!
"05 26, 2018",Most reliable car ever,This car makes me drive like a boss as I just stated my own business I would like to have this rav4 do that I can never worry about breakdowns
"05 24, 2018",Great suv,The RAV4 is a great suv. I bought it because I needed a bigger car than my Camry when I got a dog and bought a house. The 75lb pup has room and I have room for transporting yard clean up to the dump. Because of my raves about this car 2 of my friends are now happy RAV4 owners.
"05 19, 2018",Love my Rav4,"Great cargo space. Love the backup camera, steering wheel controls for audio and bluetooth. Deep cup holders so bottles won't rattle around and plenty of storage for all the things I keep in the car. Bought it at a great dealership - A1 Toyota in New Haven CT. Wouldn't shop anywhere else."
"05 16, 2018",Best car i have ever driven.,This car is reliable and comfortable to drive. It holds its value and feels very safe driving in the winter weather. Only car I will ever own.
"05  3, 2018",I have always wanted to own one.,"Overall I am pleased. Improvements could be made on quality of interior. A storage compartment on the dash for a cell phone or transponder. Also, better floor mats."
"04 21, 2018",I got exactly what I was told i will be getting.,The vehicle was in excellent condition and the price was also less than average market value. Due to the low price i did not even had to bargain
"03 30, 2018",Love my RAV,"My sister recommended the RAV and I really like mine.  I've driven it almost 100,000 km since 2015 and would definitely buy another one.  Gas mileage is great with my 4 cylinder engine.  No blind spots when you change lanes compared to my Ford Escape.  Never had one issue with it in the 3 years I've owned it."
"03 21, 2018",We're on our 2nd Rav4 and most likely to #3?,The Rav4 is the perfect vehicle for us. There's plenty room for whatever you do. The rear seats fold down for even more cargo space. Dependability is just another reason we love our Toyota.
"03 20, 2018","I love Toyota, and I especially love my 2014 Rav4","The Rav4 is well priced for its comfort, options and performance.  It drives and handles like a much more expensive vehicle, is super dependable and a very comfortable ride."
"03  7, 2018",Review of 2014 Toyota RAV4,"Would prefer armrests for long driving.  - Hoped I would get 30 mpg on long trips. Am near but not quite able to accomplish that yet. - Very comfortable for long periods in car.  Car suspension system especially comfortable.  - Have added a hitch, crossbars for roof rack, fog lights to increase usefulness of this car.  Wish seats would fold forward completely to leave a flat surface in the back of the car.  As it is there is a slight incline where the seats fall forward. -  All driving apparatus near at hand and their use is not difficult to grasp for the first-time driver.  Wish car's odometer would always show (it doesn't) when looking for other available readings such as current mpg, average mpg, Trip A, Trip B, etc.  - Am a hard marker so I think the 4 stars I have given is a very high rating for the car.    5 Stars might have been given but for the exceptions mentioned above."
"03  1, 2018",Adore my Rav 4,"Perfect size, great features, drives like a dream and is very comfortable. So glad I found this vehicle. It?s perfect! Even used its rock solid."
"02 27, 2018",Very smooth ride.,"I have only owned this vehicle for a few weeks but so far I love it. It rides smooth and has a sleek design.
If I were to have recommended an improvement it would be to improve the quality of the interior."
"02 13, 2018",Beautiful Car,I love this car. It is so nice inside and out. I bought it used and it has held up its value vary nicely. I would buy it again.
"02  7, 2018",Not the most reliable,"I've driven this car for three years now, we are at 85,000 km and the transmission is now failing. Any one having the same problem?"
"02  2, 2018",I love my RAV4,RAV4 is a great car for travel and to cruise around town. It is spacious and comfortable and I am enjoying every bit of it.
"01 31, 2018",I love RAV-4 Toyota,"It is confortable, cute, economic. And is perfect for women like me. It is not expensive and  I can fell sure driving far away or I. Express way for it estabity."
"01 29, 2018",Multi functional car.,The rav is zippy around town and gets 22 mpg as rated.  The all wheel drive works great in the snow.  I can haul a six foot step ladder with the rear seats down.  Tall adults can ride comfortably in the back seat.  I have gotten 31mpg on the highway.
"01 17, 2018",Very reliable car.,"I very seldom drive it, my wife drives the majority of the time. The size of the vehicle is much easier for to drive. Previously owned a GMC Acadia she didn't like the vehicle to big."
"01  9, 2018",Best Car Ever!!!,I had wanted a Rav 4 for a long time and now that I have one I am not disappointed!  This car handles the road well under any conditions.  I am very happy with the 29 mpg it gets.  It is very comfortable for long distance trips  both front and back with lots of leg room.  It has a spacious cargo area that I use constantly.  The interior feels very luxurious especially with all the features that came on this model.  When it is time for a new vehicle I will definitely get another Toyota Rav 4!
"12 30, 2017",LOVE my RAV 4's!!!,"Just upgraded to this vehicle....I've owned 2 others and never looked back! Excellent performance & handling, roomy, comfortable and safe for my 16 year old daughter to drive!!"
"12 28, 2017",this rav 4 has nore room inside than you think,"the rav4 is great on gas for being a awd car it has comfortable room for someone who is 6'5  and i have alot of leg room and for people in the back seats it has alot of room as well ,and when you put the seats down you haul a good amount of things as well"
"12 11, 2017",Great Car,This car met my needs.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and the back.  It rides nice and goes great in the snow.  I'm really enjoying the car.
"12  1, 2017",Love this car!,We purchased this car in October and it is great. It was a great value relative to other comparable? vehicles and we love it.
"11 29, 2017",RAV4 owner,"I purchased this car almost a year ago, after having an older model RAV4.  I love love love this car."
"11 11, 2017",the most reliable car i have owned is the one i'm,i like it because it's good on gas. it's comfortable all the way around. we go on long rides now and i don't have to get out half way threw the trip.
"11 10, 2017",AMAZING,Just bought one it is gorgeous. Cannot wait to drive my new car!!!!! The sunroof is an awesome buying feature!
"11 10, 2017",Great relialablity,Great driving enjoy the heated seats and sun roof. Electric rear hatch is easy to use and very useful.
"11 10, 2017",2012 and older were built much better,Car is just okay very disappointed after owning a 2012 rave 4 quality was sacrificed for cheaper plastics to get more fuel mileage
"11  2, 2017",My first smaller car,It met all my needs. I got good gas mileage with it. I had no problems and service was great. They did all the paper work when I bought the car.
"11  2, 2017","I leased this car new, liked it so  I bought it.","Easy to drive, easy to park. Service was great. the only problem I had was when I bought it at the end of my lease I had to wait about 5 weeks to get my title to register the after I had paid for it in full"
"10 24, 2017",Relability+,Great highway vehicle. Great fuel economy coupled with plenty of engine power. Enough goodies to make the vehicle enjoyable.
"10 22, 2017",Love my Rav4,"We love this car.  Runs great, good gas mileage and dependable.  Lots of room.  Love the back seat laying down so we can carry things.  Would recommend."
"10 21, 2017",my first car,The car met all of my needs.  It is very comfortable for me. I am driving every day to my work and bask.
"10 21, 2017",Love my RAV4!',"This car is better than I expected! Meets all my needs and is a pleasure to drive. Highly recommended to family and friends. Dealership New Country Toyota, Westport CT, and especially Nick (sales) and Jessica (service)"
"10 11, 2017",Most reliable SUV on the market.,Most reliable SUV on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"09 16, 2017",Great AWD small SUV,"We wanted an AWD, small SUV with decent gas mileage and great reliability. This car checks all the boxes! We owned a Subaru Forrester in the past; it was good but not quite as reliable."
"09 10, 2017",Best alround car on the market,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)"
"09  6, 2017",Love all the safety options,I love the way this vehicle handles. It is very cost efficient with great fuel mileage. Love the roominess in the inside for a small SUV.
"09  6, 2017","RAV4 Limited -AWD, xtra security features, loaded!",Excellent reliable and top model car with technology package included.  Hard to find Limited models with the technology package and blizzard pearl exterior with two tone interior: black/cinnamon.
"09  3, 2017",Great small SUV,"Love this car, plenty of room, power when needed and good on fuel. I've owned several Toyota's and I like this one the most."
"08 29, 2017",So far so good,"I haven't owned the car long, but it has been a good car so far. I would recommend it to people looking for a good midsize vehicle."
"08 29, 2017",Really good suv,I think that's one of the best and most reliable car I've ever owned. I really like it. Never had any issues with it.
"08 22, 2017",Couldn't be happier with my choice,"This car fits all of my needs. The back seat offers great leg room suitable for my in-laws who are over 6ft tall. The dual-zone climate control is a great feature that is included in the XLE. Backup cameras come standard and are super helpful for safety and parallel parking. I feel so safe in this vehicle and have no worries when my wife drives to work. The seats can wear you down a little bit on road trips over 3 hours long. However, once you find the way you like the seat you won't have a problem; it took me one trip to figure out just how to adjust the seat to make it fit my needs perfectly. You won't regret buying this vehicle. Another plus is that you can get fuel economy of 30+ mpg on highway driving!"
"08 10, 2017",Rideshare customers love this vehicle,"As a senior citizen, this  vehicle and all the items I was looking for in a new car including  rear camera, side mirror turn signal's, plenty of cupholders, fog lamps.  Unfortunately, hybrid technology was not available in the RAV 4 in 2014.  Rideshare customers love the roominess and comfort of the vehicle, and so do I."
"08  7, 2017",I love this car!!!!!,This was the best car for me. I'm so happy I used the service to find the most ideal vehicle for me. I found everything I wanted in the car. Thank you thank you thank you!!!
"08  7, 2017",RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION,"YOU CANT BEAT A TOYOTA FOR ALL AROUND QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I ONLY FILLED UP THE GAS TANK EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND I DROVE AROUND A LOT."
"08  5, 2017",Love my Rav4,"I just purchased my Rav4 this week.  So far I couldn't ask for a better vehicle.  It is roomy, comfortable, smooth riding and just all around perfect for me."
"08  4, 2017",Love my Rav4!!,"I've just had it a few days, but I love it!!  I have been wanting one for a long time.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  Can't wait to travel with it."
"08  3, 2017","Spacious, sporty and fun","We test drove three different cars before landing on our RAV4. We chose it because of the options of Eco Mode and Sport Mode for driving, the AWD capabilities, the absolute comfort both front and back, the look, the interior, and of course the Toyota brand! So happy to have a Toyota back in my life!"
"08  3, 2017",Sound system computer died,I am very disappointed.  I had my car less than 5 months and the radio system went out and I was told I would have to pay 800 for a new one.
"08  3, 2017",Go For The Limited,"Love the drivability of the RAV4. Once I found one with a black exterior & then experienced the interior of a Limited trim level, it was all over. I knew I had found the perfect car for me."
"07 31, 2017",Most Stylish Car I've Owned,"I have driven RAV4s before, but never one this stylish. The interior has 2-tone softex leather-trimmed seats that are not only the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but also a thing of beauty!!! It handles incredibly well and, even though it is 3 years old, it looks and handles like a brand new car. Toyota's are the best!"
"07 28, 2017",Very fun to drice,"Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love it. It drives very well and has been very reliable so far. I really like the interior design"
"07 28, 2017",Sit back and enjoy the ride,Great features on the interior. Loved the power seats that were also heated seats. 2nd row seat that reclines. Perfect size for everyday commute.
"07 24, 2017",Best car to upgrade to!,"This car is the ultimate vehicle - lots of space/leg room, great mpg for an SUV, just overall the best car I've ever owned! Highly recommend the RAV4 to anyone looking for a new car, you will not be disappointed!"
"07 23, 2017",Has power,This vehicle has power and keeps it's value. It is a Toyota by the way.  Lots of cup holders!   Very cute Suv and very reliable
"07 13, 2017",It's a Toyota!,"This is my second RAV4 and fifth Toyota overall. First RAV4 (2009) I put over 120K on it with only routine maintenance and two sets of tires. Traded for a Subaru Impreza hatchback but was not happy with it (to small). Traded Subaru for 2014 RAV4 love the looks and the size very happy, I will never own anything but Toyota! Keep up routine maintenance and Toyota will last forever."
"07  2, 2017","New owner, a leased vehicle 2 years old. Used.",",Still getting used to it, my immediate negatives were lack of storage spaces around the cabin and arm resting places while driving.  Visually there are more blind spots than I am used to, but I say that is more my adjustment than the car.  Road noise is sort of  loud, but I hit a different patch of concrete and total silence.  Is it tires or something else?  I don't have a complaint about zippy, cuz the car will adjust to your desire. I had a Montero Sport 6 cyl with the same HP and had to drive  1200 Lbs more. Positives.  I like the Blue tooth,  radio controls on the steering column.  The fuel consumption meters, backup camera, and the SPACE OVERALL. One other thing is the dash trim has a reflective surface with the sun, sort of a chrome shine."
"06 23, 2017",Love it,"The Rav4 drives smoothly, is very comfortable and has awesome features. I would highly recommend it."
"06 15, 2017",my little dream suv,"Love the whole pkg...from color to size, comfort, gas mileage. sporty looking . The Interior being black and brown called Terracotta sealed my love for it."
"06 12, 2017",Great Reliable SUV at a great price,"I'm a tall fellow at 6'4"" and the Rav4 LE fits me just fine. The right console is designed just right so my knee can rest comfortably. The Safety features are great, as is the gas mileage for an SUV. The only cons that I've found so far is there is some road noise over rough surfaces and the lack of android auto/ability to show google maps on the LED screen for navigation."
"06  3, 2017",Nice interior and exterior plus reliable,I really like  toyota Rav4. It is nice exterior and nice interior even though some are disappoint me.
"05 31, 2017",Toyotas most reliable the only cars i buy,I love my RAV4 XLE  I am comfortable and its just the right size. I wish it had GPS and an alert signal for when I am going to change lanes.
"05 31, 2017",Very reliable stylish car,Very reliable stylish car. Excellent coverage under Toyota care. The car is very comfortable and spacious and suitable for road trips as it is good on mileage.
"05 30, 2017",2013 RAV4 XLE,"The RAV4 XLE is a great value for the money. Looking for a smaller SUV, this is it.  2013 and newer has so many more options, from Bluetooth to a backup camera."
"05 23, 2017",comfortable and sleek looking,"So far, love this car.
 Cars.com had a great variety in my area. Response was immediate.Dealer was informative and helpful. Made the purchase easy."
"05 23, 2017",Great styling and reliability,Reliable vehicle with spacious and well laid out interior. Good gas mileage. Put a hitch on it and planning to tow a small boat and installed bike rack.  Great family car.
"05 21, 2017",So far so good,Just what my wife needed! Easy to get in and out of! Plenty of room for grandkids and gardening hobby.....
"05 17, 2017",I am loving my choice!,"I was able to test drive three vehicles and purchased the Toyota Rav4 XLE! Love this vehicle! It handles well, very comfortable, nice interior and great on gas.  The navigation and bluetooth ability is definitely a plus! The ECO or Sport mode option when driving is excellent! One of my better decisions in purchasing a vehicle."
"05  3, 2017",Great car for the money,"I've only had this car for a little bit but so far it's been great.  Great on gas for a crossover SUV, looks sharp, handles well and has that Toyota reliability!  A lot more spacious than it looks from the outside.  The AWD will be handy once winter hits again in here in the midwest.  It is a quiet ride also!  Great little car all around.  So far so good."
"04 24, 2017",Somewhat disappointed,"I leased a standard model RAV4 three years ago, and when deciding whether to take the car I was bothered by dumb changes they have made to the interior, plus I wasn't thrilled with the exterior design either. And today I feel the same way. For instance, they moved the cup holders so that one is under the dash making it hard to get out. There is no longer a tray in the mid-seat compartment. There is still a compartment over the glove box, but they omitted the door that would go over it. There is no light over the front cup holder and adjacent areas. To turn on the overhead lights you have to feel around for a switch instead of just tapping on the light as before. Etc. All pretty annoying if you've owned an earlier RAV4. Door keys on the earlier model design you could easily feel the buttons, whereas the new style you cannot. I'm not crazy about the lift-up rear door, but that's just me. These things still annoy me after three years of having the car, so much so that I'm thinking of trading down to an earlier model. Performance is good, including the new transmission. It's still a good vehicle, I just think they made some real mistakes in the design. I would have given the car higher reliability rating if I had not had to do a near-complete brake job a few days ago."
"04 22, 2017",Navigation screen,I own a 2014 rav4 limitted. After 2 years of using the nav screen keeps on rebooting. When i went to toyota to have it fix but the cust service said that they cant fix the screen because it is not a toyota product I was so disappointed. My vehicle is out of warranty and im willing to pay for repair.  I will never go for toyota again.
"04 11, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,me and my family  love this car because Toyota is great. Thats why we love the rav4. It is really good for children
"04  1, 2017",Decent car,I had this car for three years. The road noise was loud but it drove really well in the snow!  Overall it was a good car but my family needed something bigger
"03 24, 2017","Excellent aerodinamic, economic in gas","Good I recommend it. If you can afford a hybrid, get it. very good in gas, excellent in sport mode if you wanna get away fast. The entertainment system is not good, cheap, a pain to upgrade, and only navigation in full loaded."
"03 10, 2017",RAV4 Limited,"I love this vehicle though I am open-minded. I am on the lookout for a similar/different vehicle that is very reliable, comfortable and has economical gas consumption."
"03  7, 2017",I had a RAV4 for 10 years. I love this one too,I had a 2006 RAV4 and then went to a Camry for the last year and a half. It was so low to the ground and just wasn't me. I love the room and comfort of the RAV4
"02 10, 2017",Toyota Rav 4 2014,Bought my rav 4 brand new in 2014 jan.1 year later i noticed colour change in my moulding looking like burnt patches.Filled a claim with Toyota which they declined to replace and told me i will have to pay for it.Now we are in 2017 the patches have continue to increase.Six months ago my radio just stopped working again i went to Toyota and reported all they said was i need to replace a new radio.It keeps reloading then goes off again and again.I have noticed this is a common problem with toyota.I am a very dissatisfied and disappointed customer.Am still paying for car.
"01  9, 2017",Radio Issues,My radio recently went out on my Toyota Rav 4. I haven't even owned  the vehicle for three years. I am over on miles so the warranty is void. The dealership wants 1200 dollars to replace my existing radio with a refurbished radio. I have checked the internet and this seems to be a defect with the system.
"12 19, 2016",2014 Red Toyota Rav4 LE,I bought my Toyota Rav4 as a certified Pre-Owned and it never disappointed me. The car is very smooth and definitely recommend to others.
"10 23, 2016",It's not a Porsche,"Awesome car for the money. If you are looking for top of the line quality leather, and you can't live without another cup holder, buy a Lexus. If you need speed,  buy a Porsche.  If you want style, and want to look like you know what you're spong, buy this Rav 4. And stop borrowing your grandmother's Buick!"
"09  1, 2016",Radio/Bluetooth,Have had my 2014 Toyota RAV 4 into the dealership 3 times with radio/bluetooth problems and it is still not fixed. The first time the radio was stuck on a station and I could not control volumn. Took it to dealership and they said it was a computer upgrade. Picked up the car and then the blue tooth was not working and constantly flashes connect/disconnect they said they fixed it again. Picked it up and still not working so took it back to dealer and they say they will replace the entire radio. Get it back with the new radio and still not working. Now they will not call me back to get it in again and it will be a week tomorrow since I picked it up and called them on 8/27/2016 saying it is still not working. Besides this problem they sold me a clear coat on the paint and scotch guard for inside and it seems like the paint chips even worse than any other car I've ever owned. The ride is not smooth and feels like you're in a truck when you go over bumps. I bought the car new in 2014 but I probably won't be hanging onto it for much longer.
"01  2, 2016",Rav4 a good bet,"I was shopping at end of year for 2013-2014 AWD vehicle with hatchback. I test drove the Subaru Outback , Toyota Rav4 Limited, Ford Escape SE and Titanius and Honda CRV touring. For the money and features the Toyota was the best buy. I will say the Honda was the smoothest ride and the Ford had the best engine performance. The Toyota was in-between these two for performance and comfort. The sport mode did give it better performance and the eco mode is nice for basic driving. Subaru Outback was not as good driving and I was surprised. Looking at the XLE and Limited in my view the Limited is worth it (~2-3K more on the used model). The limited has better seats and comfort. Also just more stand items included. Some have complained on the Bluetooth system. It works with my iphone 5 just fine and the dealer showed me a few tricks. The nav system is not the greatest, but not a big deal for me. since I like to use my phone anyway (included with limited so I have it). The interior lighting is a bit for for the switches but not a show stopper.

Things I really liked were visibility, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, drivers seat adjustments., AWD, handling and overall power."
"10  8, 2015",i hate this piece,I rented this car and I was NOT impressed. Everyone was saying the same thing.. S it has backseat recliners wow.. I would buy the Ford Escape or the X Trail or the CRV or something else I can't believe I rented this... I hate Toyota cars because they are extremely boring and timeless...Their parts are expensive and the don't last as long as you think
"09 30, 2015",2014 rav 4,Never enjoyed a day with my 2014 rav 4. So regretted buying it. The ride is the worst I have ever experienced causing my central nervous system to take a hit. Toyota says thats how they are built.
"09 25, 2015","Great vehicle, overall","I own a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD. Pros: Stable, comfortable ride with a relatively smooth and well-behaved 6-speed automatic transmission. Back-up camera is fantastic. Rear leg room is massive, especially compared to a sedan of equal length. The rear seats recline, which is great. The heated seats are phenomenal. The AWD system, brakes, and traction control make this vehicle feel extremely steady in poor, wintery conditions. It surprised me how well it all works. Cons: Cheap plastic around shifter lever. Rear styling is weird. The tail lights are odd-looking, and the button to release the rear hatch is far too high. Engine is very weak. I would have bought a V6 if it were still available. Overall, it's a great little SUV. It has a good balance of utility, size, and car-like handling. Just don't buy this vehicle if you're looking for something exciting to drive. It's not for people who value performance."
"09 16, 2015",Overated but Good Space and MPG,"Pros:
Nice Cargo Space for Mini SUV.
Good MPG.
Fairly quiet ride.

Cons:
Blind Spots due to High Metal doors and tailgate. Very Loud Interior Rumble when back windows are open. Uncomfortable seat after one hour of driving. Lack of true recreation assistance features. Lightweight aluminum doors dent very easily. Tailpipe and muffler hang down like they forgot to plan for it. No way to tie down tailgate when transporting large items with tailgate open. No way to shut off annoying beeper when tailgate is open. Tiny tiny arm rest storage box. Integrated voice calling and stereo need improvement.

Summary
A bit disappointed. I would not purchase a RAV4 again."
"08 31, 2015",terrible interioal finish,Just want to let every one knows rav4 has terrible and unacceptable defects in the interioal finish. to look at the joint between windshield and top and you can see how rough the job they have done.that is really unacceptable!!!!!!! looks just like junk !!! not understand why they made rav4 like this. I checked other cars there is no one make this joint like rav4
"08 17, 2015",Excellant car,"Lots of Space, great gas mileage, dependable, good dealer network. The wind noise very noticeable at freeway speeds specially when going over 75mph. But good outward visibility, smooth breaking, and powertrain is smooth and efficient"
"07  1, 2015",Unrepairable Air conditioner (AC),"Car is beautiful over all,
but it has stinky Air conditioner. And Toyota refuse to fix it under warranty. IT costs about 160$ every 3-4 months to have it deodorizer and change cabin filter."
"04  7, 2015",rav 4 negatives,"I purchased a 2014 rav4 on Nov 3, 2014. The xle model is great looking but not knowing the rating on the vehicle I did purchase the full 5yr 100,000 extra warraty. Now for the negatives as follows:
1. The speed indicator is off a solid two miles an hour and I hope I don't get a speeding ticket.
2. Too much glare on the screen in middle of dash.
3. This one makes me balistic - The bluetooth system really sucks, sucks, and sucks some more. I had it to the dealer and he said my problem is the brand of phone I have-bull ! I have a 2013 Chevy Silverado and the phone works the was it should on the bluetooth system so it's not my phone. This is how bad it is - When I receive a call after around two minutes the connectivety is lost and will not return until I pull off the road and shut the car off and wait two minutes and restart the car and then it returns. I don't care what brand of car from the most costly to the least that's just plain discusting. I was looking at a Chevy Equinox and only if I would have know I would be driving one. I will never buy another new car without test driving the bluetooth.
4. The dealer has the unliest dealer stickers ever that they put on the car and I just had to remove it."
"02 20, 2015",Lynch Toyota Manchester Ct,"I recently bought a 2014 Rav 4 LTD,
on the day I was picking up my Rav 4, Eduardo explained in great detail how to use Auto High Beam, Lane Departure Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and plus Entune Premium JBL Audio with Navigation Multimedia App Suite, and connecting my I Phone including my address book and music.
Yesterday had a problem with my music not connected, called and Eduardo was on a trip to New York, he called later in the afternoon, set up appointment in the evening and this problem was corrected in 5 minuets.
Lynch Toyota is very lucky to have this terrific person on
their team."
"01 11, 2015",Overall Pleased,"We rented this vehicle for a trip from Florida to California and back. We spent 3 weeks and 5800 miles in it. Two adults and probably 400 lbs of cargo. I found the gas mileage around home (35-55 mph with few lights) was around 34 mpg. On the road at 75 mph we got 27ish mpg on 10% ethanol and 28+ on pure gas. At 70 mph it gave 28.5ish on ethanol and 30-31 on real gas and at 65 it was 29 on ethanol and 32-33 on pure gas. Around L.A. (the city of cars & traffic) we averaged 24.5. Overall we got 28+ mpg. for the trip. 28 heading west and 28.5 going east. I found the wind affected the mileage greatly. For 2 adults it was fine. Rode comfortably. When the adult kids were with us we found issues with the back seat belts not wanting to release. The cup holders in the back are not very user friendly either. For my wife and I, I would consider buying one of these. If we had younger kids I would still consider it. For a family with teens, I'm not so sure. One thing I found I did not like but I got used to was the hood flexed and bounced around. I thought it wasn't latched tight, but it was."
"01  1, 2015",Love this SUV,"We really love this car and it's a Toyota. I worked at a GM dealer for 40 years as a mechanic so do know my cars. Previously owned a 2004 Pontiac Vibe which really was a Toyota Matrix with Pontiac badges. It was a fantastic car with no problems in 135,000 miles. Bad move GM as we loved the Vibe so much that when it came time to replace the Vibe GM had quit making them. We would have purchased a Matrix but Toyota quit making them also. Bad move Toyota. Had made up our minds to purchase a Subaru Outback but having seen way too many bad reviews on them using oil. Took a Rav4 for a test drive and loved it. Live in Montana and the AWD is amazing for getting around on the snow/icy roads. It gives almost too much confidence on how well it handles horrible roads. Was going tonight put snow tires on but it would have been wasted moneys because it goes anywhere with the factory highway tires. I could nitpick but all the great features make up for everything."
"12 20, 2014",Poor Cabin Design,"We are leasing a Rav 4. As with most cars you have to live with it a while to see short comings. The interior has many flaws, poor location for many switches which cannot be accessed without contortions. Very poor interior lighting, especially in the rear. The bottom of the doors collect mud and snow leaving your clothes a mess as well as the garage floor. No illumination for controls located on the door. The heated seats are not as effective as others I have owned. The gas tank is too small. The radio operation requires a Masters from MIT, hundreds of pages to the manual! I am glad I am leasing and not owning."
"10 23, 2014",My other Toyota experience is promising.,"This is a very good car for the money. Seems to be more economical than advertised. Practically noiseless, and well controllable."
"10 11, 2014",Navigation Blues,"I found the navigation screen almost impossible to use due to the glare. I have overcome this by using a $200. Garmin Nuvi, and stuck the suction onto a hockey puck then dropped the whole thing into the front cup holder. The power outlet is right there and the screen can be tilted toward the driver and is crystal clear regardless of bright sunlight. The puck fits snugly into the cup holder which is a convenient coincidence. As far as reading radio stations and other data, well that is still a problem for me, anyone got an idea?"
"10 10, 2014",Rav4 Ride!,Purchased 2014 Rav4 after comparing with other famous sports utility and been driving it for about 2 months now. Cabin is noisy and ride is bumpy!
"09 29, 2014",First time Toyota user,"this is the first time I have purchased a Toyota personally. I have had friends with them, but for me I have not owned one. So far, with the one month of use, I like the vehicle. I am a bit disappointed in the engine size but with time I hope to get use to it. On the highway it takes a bit to get the car moving..."
"09 23, 2014",Still learning,"Have owned the Rav4 for a month. We are very pleased with it so far. Ride and comfort are excellent. We are still learning what the car can do. The manual for electronics package alone is 200 pages. One small complaint, display screen is nearly flush with dash board and sometimes unreadable in bright sunlight."
"09 23, 2014",Nicest Car I have Ever Owned,"After reviewing rating online and consumer reports, I decided to see a Toyota Rav4 at the dealership. My husband and I found this vehicle to be everything we both were looking for in a sporty vehicle. Being that we like to do outdoor activities, Sunday drives, traveling, this vehicle provides everything we were looking for in a car. We purchase the XLE model that included the navigation. It has the sun roof, gps and other applications such as weather and traffic. It also has fog lights and many other features to make our trips enjoyable. We are very pleased with out purchase."
"09 18, 2014",bad MPG,"Dad MPG, this is my toyota, and i getting bad MPG 21 city; 26 hwy. love the radio and phone setup. at 4,000 miles. no problem."
"09 12, 2014",love my rav4,"It's really too early to give an impression of the things on the list, we just bought it yesterdqy. BUT, it was a replacement for a 2012 Rav 4 which was totaled in a MVA. Our 2012 was very reliable. Never had a bit of trouble with it. . I love Toyota!!"
"09  8, 2014",Make sure you're comfortable in the RAV4,"I've driven the RAV4 for about 1000 miles an overall I'm very happy, you as a prospective Rav 4 buyer compare the XLE and Limited for seat comfort. I find the armrest moves back-and-forth ""adjustable"" and sometimes is annoying and blocks the drink holder. Also a couple of the controls are in-conveniently placed above your left knee while sitting in the driver seat. I purchased the limited because I wanted blizzard pearl paint and I am very happy that I did I'm happy with all at this point after driving the thousand miles the liftgate is very convienient The pushbutton start is wonderful and the doorhandles lock and unlock is a very convenient feature. I would highly recommend the RAV4 for mileage and controls and drivability and I would recommend it to a friend"
"09  5, 2014",Good and bad.,"I just got a new 2014 RAV 4 Limited edition last month. I previously drove 2008 RAV 4 for 4 years and a 2012 Rave 4 XLE for 2 years. They are very reliable SUVs.

2014 RAV 4 Pro:
- Very reliable to drive during all season
- Easier to maneuver, turn and drive
- It has slightly better shock absorption capacity from uneven road than the previous models.
- Good mirrors that provide wider and better view of the road.
- Limited edition comes with lots of features, like back up camera, seat warmer etc.
- Good cargo space but less than the 2008 and 2012 models.
- Comes with two separate mats for winter and summer.
- Well priced for a SUV.

2014 RAV 4 Con:
- It has absolutely no leg space in the back passenger seats. It is impossible for normal height and tall people to seat comfortably at the back. It has less space than a normal sedan. The inside is tiny.
- The integrated software system for GPS and audio control is very bad and full of flaws.
- Consumes way more gas then the two previous models I drove.
- It has only two storage compartment at the front, smaller in size than the previous models. The previous models had multiple small compartments that were convenient to store things like sunglass, spare change for emergency and other electronic items like phones out of sight. The 2014 model have none of these. The compartment they made to keep phone is out in the open and every time the car stops even decelerating gradually, it slips and falls on the floor.
Overall, Toyota made 2014 RAV 4 cheap by cutting out all the useful, convenient little things. If you had a previous model with good features, don't change to this new model. If you are buying a RAV 4, buy a previous model with added features. I drove 2008 and 2012 models; they are very good, reliable cars with a better fuel mileage. If I had a Limited edition of 2012 RAV 4, I definitely would have kept it.
Good luck!"
"09  5, 2014",Third Toyota I've Owned,"I've been very satisfied with all 3 Toyotas I've had. I chose the RAV 4 because I needed a car large enough to hold a big dog crate (with the backseats down), but didn't want a huge SUV.
Had the car less than a month, but have been really happy with it."
"08 28, 2014",To Purchase or Not Purchase,"I own a 2014 XLE AWD. I've read the reviews and here are my thoughts:

Likes:
Flat, big cargo space for a little SUV.
MPG is what they claim... Hwy 29-32, City 24-28.
Bluetooth handless phone capability.
Control panel on steering wheel.

Dislikes:
Uncomfortable seat and head rest.
Blind spots due to high door design.
Heated seat option not available.
Glare on monitor screen.
Feels like a high center of gravity. Not stout.
Muffler and pipes visible.
Yes, the hood does bounce.
Funky cruise control post.
Lack of comfortable driver arm rests.
Yes, there is a vibration with windows open.
Unable to activate/deactivate all interior lights with one switch.

Recommendation:
I can't recommend this vehicle primarily because the seats are uncomfortable and there are too many blind spots due to high door design."
"08 22, 2014",Just fine,"I've owned this car for a month - 2014 xle. Purchased this over the Mazda CX-5 because of the price alone (Toyota has bargaining power. Mazda doesn't at this point). I've owned a lot of Toyotas and they all drive pretty much the same. The second I drove this car, I felt comfortable. It responds well, it feels exactly like other toyotas I've owned. I'm not, however, blown away. There is a crazy glare on the screen. I'm technologically savvy and the computer system organization doesn't make any freaking sense. I've read the manual, spent more time than I have on candy crush personalizing the navigation, and I still can't get a seamless experience when driving. The voice command doesn't understand me and I've tried to calibrate it multiple times. Other issues - I have to step back every time I open the back door and there aren't enough storage compartments (I used to own a 2 door Yaris with more small-storage space than this car). Those things aside - it's a toyota and has AMAZING resell value (My yaris depriciated $200 in 5 years) and amazing reliability and my dealer has a great service department. I'm not crazy about this car, but for the money and the company, it's a great choice."
"08 16, 2014",I Love my Rav 4,It's sporty and responsive. I can't imagine owning anything else. Everyone that has looked at it will be considering the Rav 4 for their next vehicle. Toyota makes such a great product!
"08 13, 2014",Best car that I can see out of really good,I can see out of this vehicle all around and love the backup camera.It rides a little like a truck but it has big wheels so that is probably the reason.All in all I like this vehicle.
"08  9, 2014",Overall excellent...some disappointments,"I bought this car to replace a well used and loved 2006 Highlander. The mileage in the RAV4 is substantially higher. It is not quite as large, but will do the job.

I've been driving it for almost a month and following are my comments.

Disappointments:
1. Noisy, jumpy ride
2. Terrible radio
3. No remote opener for garage doors (on top model)
4. No space for sunglasses and other odds and ends
5. Non locking glove compartment (!)
6. Overly complex electronics
7. Hard seats
8. Would like stronger headlights (as I have aged, my eyes get worse at night vision)

What I like:
1. It's a Toyota (dependable and effecient)
2. Nice looking vehicle
3. Decent cargo capacity
4. Power liftgate (reason I didn't consider CRV)"
"08  6, 2014",RAV 4,"Better equipment and technology than a Honda CRV. Trying to get adjusted to a smaller vehicle (sold Ram1500 4X4 Quad Cab) Not a solid as the Rm but better mileage. Choice was between Ford Edge, CRV and RAV4. Edge & RAV4 equal except in price."
"08  3, 2014",Good SUV,"I have owned Toyotas for last 25 years and happy with the performance. With basic maintenance, never had any major problems. New RAV-4 Limited has lots of options that normally I expected in Lexus or luxury car.
Navigation, Backup camera, Blind spot, Lane designation, etc. makes it easy to drive. Ride is not very comfortable as car or van but I expected that being SUV."
"07  9, 2014",Not so pleased,"After driving a 2011 Nissan Rogue, I purchased a RAV4 basically for the looks and Toyota's rep on quality. Trading it in. The seats are hard and uncomfortable and the ride is like a wagon. I can feel every bump! I purchased the XLE and even though it has back up camera, bluetooth, etc, NO electric seats, no sunglass case. I couldve done without the sunroof for electric seats and a better ride!!!"
"06 16, 2014",Realistic Review,"6/16/2014

This is an objective and realistic review from a person who has owned a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD for two weeks and has completed several 300 mile trips. Male, 5'8"", 180 lbs, age 50.

PROS

- Hwy MPG averaging 31.
- Cargo Space is larger than competition.
- Voice activated Bluetooth cellular functionality.
- Voice and Hand activated stereo functionality.
- Seems like a quiet smooth ride.
- Front seat side cushions are comfortable.
- AWD availability.
- Reliable track record.

CONS

- Nowhere to rest elbows during driving. Uncomfortable. Try it.
- Seat is hard an uncomfortable after 2 hours.
- No neck support...There is a monster head support that doesn't adjust well, but why can't mfgrs make a nice neck support!!
- Very very loud rumble/vibration if rear windows are open during driving.
- Can't read air/heat temperature because the mounting plate is tilted toward sunroof reflection.
- New ""sleek"" design is less functional providing less cargo space and access for large items.
- More door height and less window... personal preference to have more window, less door panel.
- Heated seats not available...Come on gang!!!

I believe the 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD is more ""sporty"" than comfortable and is targeted to the younger generation. I believe the focus is to attract this market with a ""sleek"" design and bells and whistles provided thru the monitor screen. Most of the mini SUV mfgrs appear to be copying each other with this new design.

Personally, I prefer to have more cargo space than a ""sleek"" design so I can fit things into my mini SUV. The loveseat I recently purchased won't fit because they tapered off the back end. Otherwise, it would have fit. I would also prefer more seat comfort, elbow rests and neck rest! If you want comfort, make sure you test drive it several times. The Honda CRV seemed more comfortable but had less cargo area. It is a nice looking vehicle and has some bells to play with, but try to look beyond looks and whistles if you also desire functionality and comfort."
"05 30, 2014",Not as good as CRV,"Rav-4 no sunglass holder, front hood has sun glare, does not take bumps and potholes as good as Honda CRV,rear child locks needed. Leased will tolerate for few years."
"05 29, 2014",Toyota rav4 is the best SUV,If you are on the market for a SUV you can not go past the rav4 becomes it is not that expensive to by and it has a grate re-sale value. Also if you are looking for a SUV that can be used for mol table courses such as for off roading or for camping or for local city driving well I recommend this is the perfect car for you.
"05 26, 2014",one of the most reliable cars i have owned,"viewing excellent, dual air conditioning in front, bluetooth hands off to control phone, and radio, power sun roof, new styling front fenders and rear lights. great car probably the last car I will buy!!!"
"05 20, 2014",First brand new car,It is my first brand new car. I feel so relax by driving it. I definitely love my new Toyota Rav4 and I will recommend my friend to buy it.
"05 19, 2014","Happy with Wellesley Toyota, Wellesley MA","I am very happy with TOyota RAV4. It has a beautiful exterior in greay and the interior is also impressive.

What impressed me was the Sales Manager who sold me the car. He was one of the best representatives of any Toyota dealer I've gone to, Martin Hansberry of Wellesley Toyota explained the features of several makes and i am very happy with his suggestions. We negotiated for a price and I was very happy with our final agreement. I had prevously gone to another dealer in Framingham and was very dissatisfied even though I had purchased three other new Toyotas from that same dealer, Their offer was insulting and I will never go back.
Happily Wellesley Toyota makes me a customer for life.."
"05 17, 2014",great car,"After looking at the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester I decided on the Rav 4. I own 4 Camrys for a business and sold an older one last year with 249,000 miles. Toyota reliability speaks for itself. I got the LE with roof rack, mats and mud flaps. Rides nice with wrap around seats. Great gas mileage compared to my trade in 2003 6 cyl. Mazda Tribute. Engine has plenty of power. Sound system is great with Bluetooth and IPOD capability. I removed the rear seat passenger headrest for better visibility when I don't have passengers. But mirrors are positioned well. Looking out the front window over towards the passenger side front area takes some getting use to as the fender is flared upwards. Would recommend this to a friend for sure"
"05 15, 2014",2014 Rav 4 LE......seat comfort,"Regarding the 2014 RAV 4 LE:
Recently test drove it, then purchased it. Does any one else feel a springy band across the seat cushions which bounces into your butt when you drive? This is a really weird feeling! and it's right under your butt! It appears to be in all the seats, but I feel it especially in the front bucket seats.
If I felt it before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
"05  8, 2014",Fabulous!,I absolutely love my brand new Rav 4! I am 62 yrs. old and this is my first brand new car and I feel like a queen! It has everything I need in it and more! It drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage! I would definitedly tell my friends to buy one of these!
"05  5, 2014",Reliability,"Love my Rav 4 so far, especially the flexibility of drive modes. Very important to save on fuel. Will reserve final review after I drive through snow!"
"05  3, 2014",2012 Rav 4,"My 4th Toyota, 1st SUV, 1st preowned car. Absolutely love it! Was nervous about preowned, but it's an excellent car. Of course, it's Toyota!."
"05  3, 2014",good value,"I have owned 7 new Toyota's over the years and am constantly amazed at how they choose the ""standard"" features for each model. They don't seem to make any common sense. For example. My new RAV-4 XLE comes with a standard power sunroof which I might use 2 times as year! I would rather have the 8-way power seat which my wife and I would use every day!
Also the placement of the electric outside driver mirror switch is in a difficult location to operate. I have to look down towards the floor and to the far left, totally away from the road. I have to pull over and stop just to change the angle of the mirror! Also to operate the radio is a nightmare, I have been through the manual but cannot understand how to lock in a new station. What ever happened to just turning a knob and pushing a button? It's crazy!"
"05  1, 2014",Tuff for my gsd,"The only things I don't like
1. No Keyless trunk open (offered on limited, but had to get leather seats to get limited)
2. Got to ""pump"" yah seat up w a lever on side. Not electric.
I"
"04 27, 2014",Hooked on Toyota,"This review is based solely on dealer test drives, therefore my ratings on this RAV4 are limited. However, something may need to be asked about driver visibility on this vehicle. I am over six feet and yet when I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful SUV, I see all hood and no road. Even with a height adjustment, this unfortunate design still exists. I owned a 2003 RAV4 and I remember its selling point to me was the clarity of vision while sitting behind the wheel. Am I the only one reacting this way? My wife and I want to buy this vehicle but this is an issue that troubles us. Any thoughts on this?"
"04 23, 2014",nice car,FOCUS ON THE VEHICL'E FEATURES AND BE SPECIFIC. DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEFORE REVIEWING IT. INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE AND SPECIFIC DEALERSHIP.
"04 19, 2014",thought we liked it not at all,we leased 2013 xle its ok ride is terrible accelerates terrible no power very cheap interior not real happy had it for a year wish we got a camry highlander I think were paying to much for that vehicle to
"04 15, 2014",poor Rav-4,This is the worst SUV that i have ever brought...it has not space and have a really bad 4-wheel drive
"04 13, 2014",Updates on 2014 RAV 4,"Back cargo area has insufficient lighting ( adding ) more of my own. Radio control panel/Navigation impossible to use in certain sunlight, Not just a little. Also, some switches behind and lower of steering are very difficult to use because steering wheel blocks them out. Like the cars. but these three things are very irritating to me,. And I think the 2 year, 25,000 mile warranty would have been a deal breaker if I was thinking more clearly."
"04 12, 2014",Two Weeks from Purchase,"I had a tough time in deciding between the Terrain and the RAV4, but more acceleration (translating safety) and wife's comfort in the seats was the final determinant. Previously owning a '06 Camry also pointed toward reliability. Last weekend we took a round trip of about 400 miles, and I perceived a much stiffer ride than that of the Camry, although it is quite nimble in handling, and quieter. I did notice that on bumpy roads the hood vibrated, especially along the back leading edge. (Perhaps I am too picky.) Investigation revealed just a flexible plastic ""support"" structure under this edge, no steel, so no bolstering pad can be applied under the hood there. This design flaw should be ameliorated.

The transmission shifts well, but the audio controls are a bit confusing for old folks, even though we are computer literate.

Would I buy it again after this two weeks of driving experience? Probably, but its just like getting married - its going to take a while to adjust to the changes, and to really KNOW, although you have committed for life."
"04  9, 2014",Perfect starter SUV,"This is a lux, easy to use and drive ""starter"" SUV. It has a comfortable ride and it feels sturdy and safe. I appreciate that it has an eco and sport mode, and it comes with a lot of upgraded features even in the base LE. My only complaint is the touch screen. I wish it was either angled to the driver or had a small lip or visor over it as when the sun is out it becomes very hard to read."
"04  8, 2014",Smooth Driving Machine,This is a reliable crossover/SUV with a lot of inner space and comfort for front row and back row passengers.
"04  7, 2014",Great vehicle,Very pleased with this RAV 4!!!!!!! Bought the limited after not planning for anything past the XLE. Turned out to be a great decision! Highly recommended!!!!'mm
"03 22, 2014","nice vehicle, but not totally satisfied","This review is on the 2014 Rav4 Limited Edition.
While the exterior and interior are great to look at....I have some reservations on the vehicle regarding majority of the interior.
1. My #1 complaint is about the touchscreen radio. I wear polarized sunglasses (to minimize glare) but when the sun hits the screen...I can't see ANYTHING on the touchscreen radio!! I have to take my glasses off and then I can KIND of see. They should make the touch screen anti-glare or something because even when not wearing my sunglasses, when the sun hits the screen it is VERY difficult to see anything.
2. There are NO INTERIOR LIGHTING in the glove compartment, center console, or cargo area!!!! So, when it's night time and I have to get something from the glove box or center compartment I have to use the lighting from the top by the rear view mirror. And if I have to get anything in the cargo area at night...forget about it!!! I can't see anything, so I have to get out a flashlight or use my cell phone to look around. Granted, I do have black interior but still...at the very least wouldn't you think that there'd be SOME kind of lighting for the cargo area?!
3. There are very few interior compartments and the center console is pretty shallow compared to other vehicles I've had. At the very least, for the limited edition they could have included a compartment for your glasses. I find myself having to stuff everything into one place since there's such limited room. My smaller Honda Civic had wayyy more compartments and little nooks than this bigger size Rav4.
4. I'm sure they added all of the plastic pieces to the vehicle to save $. It would've been nicer without it, but of course it would've been much more expensive.
Aside from all of that...I will say, the vehicle is a beauty to look at. I really like the different things you can do with the radio, change settings to certain things to fit what you want, and I absolutely love the heated seats. The ECO mode and the SPORT mode are interesting...but I honestly don't feel too much of a difference. The vehicle is very smooth to drive and I'm hoping to be keeping it around for another 10+ years!"
"03 20, 2014",Love my Rav4,Just traded in my 2005 Rav4 for a new 2014 one. Love the interior and the comfort. The outside is beautiful. Interior features I did not know was in there. As always it drives so smoothly and effortlessly. Would not of traded in my old Rav4 but the new features on the new one will make my life easier. I never had a problem with the old one and am sure I will experience the same high quality on the new Rav4.
"03 19, 2014",Can't beat a Toyota,"Out of the other cars in this class that I looked at, I like the fact that the RAV4 sits up a bit higher. I also like that the spare wheel is no longer mounted on the hatch door but located inside, I also like that the hatch door rises up, versus opening from left to right. Much easier for loading/unloading to have the door out of the way.

The back seats fold down fairly flat. I don't have to remove the head rests or move the front seats up any.

I wish that Toyota had kept the lock on the glove box, but I guess they have to reduce costs somewhere. The inside styling is a little more functional and looks nice. The rear view camera is a nice addition.

I love the hands-free calling thru the radio. The sound quality is very good. No more tunnel sounds or wind-rushing sounds on the other end. Easy to set up and use. The voice activated calling is great. I was very surprised. I also like that Pandora, when open on my phone, automatically streams thru the radio as soon as I turn on the ignition.

I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but so far it is great.

The only drawback at this point, is the cloth seat has a seam indentation near the seat-back. At first I thought this was a defect in the cushion, but soon discovered that it is the style of the seat. It is kind of strange to get used to at first, but I'm sure eventually I'll forget about it.

The heated air takes about 5 minutes to warm up when the car is cold, and is not super hot, but adequate to stave of the cold. I find in general, that Toyotas take a bit longer to reach a hot air temperature, compared to other brands.

I also find that I have to be careful to shut the door firmly, otherwise the latch catches, but the door isn't shut all the way. Several times I have failed to shut either the hatch or side doors properly and have to open and re-shut them. Only a minor nuisance.

By the way, this review is based on the LE, automatic transmission. I really wanted the heated seats, but did not want to sacrifice the 3inches of head space for the sun-roof. I think it is a great car and will give me many years of satisfaction."
"03 10, 2014",Love my RAV4!,"I purchased a Camry XLE in December 2013. I HATED it. So, after 2 months of driving it I traded it in for a 2014 RAV4 XLE. It was so worth it. I love everything about this car. I love the way it looks, the interior styling and features, the exterior, the technology, the way it drives-it's *exactly* what I wanted in a new vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it. The *one* thing I do wish it had more of is interior compartments/storage nooks-like a coin compartment or a compartment for my sunglasses. That's the only thing it lacks.
I am so glad that I didn't waste any more time with the Camry and got my RAV4.
I couldn't be happier with it!"
"03  8, 2014",Glad I Purchased,"I originally test drove this car based on a friend's recommendation. He has an older model RAV4 and is pleased with it.

I have been driving my new RAV4 for approximately one month, and I am enjoying it! The only reason for 4 stars in the ""Comfort"" category is that I find that when getting into the driver's seat, I have to make sure to be positioned perfectly (for me) or, if driving for an extended period, I begin to get somewhat uncomfortable. I think that this problem will go away as the car and I ""get used to each other"", so not a biggie in the downgrade department.

One review I read (before buying) did not think the car had fast enough acceleration when in the ""eco"", or efficient gas mode. However, I keep it in ""eco"" all the time and have not had any trouble safely accelerating while entering highway traffic. Also, my latest MPG was 26 combined town and highway, with more local than highway driving.

In short....I love this vehicle and think Toyota has done an outstanding design job! I can't think of an item they may have overlooked."
"03  5, 2014",Love my Rav4,"I've had my car for over a month and really love it. The seats are comfortable and everything is within reach when driving. The blue tooth does not work as well as I wish it did, but I bought the car for its reliability and safety. So far I am getting better gas mileage than my 2007 Camry (it was a v6). The drive is smooth and if I want a little more kick, I can change from the eco setting to the sport setting. If I could change anything, I wish the back window was a little larger and that I could get more visibility out of it especially when trying to zip in and out of traffic. Other than that, it's a winner."
"03  5, 2014",My favorite car of all time,"This is my third Rav4. I owned a 2001 and 2005 Rav4 previously. I needed a bigger car in 2008 and the Sienna felt a little small. I purchased a 2008 Chrysler Town & Country. What a mistake that was, I had nothing but problems from the day I purchased it. It is a beautiful car but poorly built. I have NEVER had a problem with my Rav4's so I went back to that. It is the best car ever!!!
Thank you Toyota!
Catherine"
"02 25, 2014",Over & above my expectations!,"My family has always had Fords, but we wanted to try a lease and had seen the good deals on the Toyota Rav 4 - went to Spitzer in Monroeville and dealt with Jim Yoxall - he was excellent! He took the time to explain the lease to us, and answer any questions we had on the car, it was over and above all my expectations! It handles so smoothly, ride is extremely comfortable, has many features and has done wonderful on gas mileage for us. The car has done extremely well in the bad weather we have recently had in PA, and I would highly recommend this car! If anyone is unsure of a Toyota take a trip to Spitzer and ask to talk to Jim and see what a good deal and exceptional vehicle hecan put you in. I will definitely return to Spitzer to deal again when our lease is up."
"02 19, 2014",Great experience,I recently bought a Rav 4 from a salesmen by the name of Shawn. He was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. I had a great experience and I feel like everyone should know.....Go see the boys of Lakewood Toyota!!
"02 14, 2014",Fun and Sassy to Drive,"This vehicle has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Just turned 10K miles. Fun to drive and a wow factor too. I purchased it for local, run around yet overall smaller than the previous Sienna . It fit those profiles. Now, unexpectedly I've had to make to long haul trips (750 mi) each way and guess what? Quiet, smooth, exceptional handling and good gas mileage too. These I did not expect with a small SUV. The ""sport mode"" really gives this little engine some get up and go! Usually drive in the economy mode though. I do wish I had bought the auto rear deck opener. I think a good value with Toyota quality included."
"01 30, 2014",Good Reliable compact SUV for my daughter,Good and nice small compact SUV for daughter. so she can go to college and work.good gas milege and saving money
"01 16, 2014",my 2014 not as good aS OUR 2011,"OUR 2014 DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR 2011

BUT WE DO LIKE THE MISSING OUTSIDE SPARE
THE SEATS COULD USE MORE PADDING
THIS ONE DONT HAVE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS"
"01  7, 2014",Third New Toyota,"Toyota's have always given me excellent service. They are reliable, well- built and affordable.Sales staff highly professional and courteous. Volunteered information and advice that made purchase experience very enjoyable."
"12  5, 2023",rav4 very gud,"Overall, the RAV4 is a great car for commuting, families of four, and space. The RAV4 is the best when it comes to reliability. The RAV4 is very spacious in the second row and the trunk and the car offers comfortable seats. The RAV4 gets okay fuel economy but it does do decent in the snow. However there are some things that it lacks. The RAV4's navigation system is very frustrating to use, just use google maps instead. The RAV4's interior quality is not that great either, there are tons of fake buttons and plastic throughout the interior, but no one who buys a RAV4 cares about the interior. The RAV4 has decent styling, but it is not as stylish as the Mazda CX-5. The RAV4 only has 1 engine option, but does not feel underpowered. The RAV4 also doesn't have a very quiet or comfortable ride. Even though the seats are comfortable, the ride is loud and the inside rattles frequently. If you don't care about luxury and want a practical, reliable car, the RAV4 is perfect."
"07 26, 2023",Very Reliable!!,I absolutely am in love with my Rav! The gas mileage is great! I have owned my Rav for years! I just turned over 100000 miles on it. I have not had any big problems with it at all! They don't make cars like this anymore! My RAV is so very reliable!  It also does super great in the snow as well!
"06 28, 2023",THE BEST NEW CAR EVER PURCHASED BY ME!!!,"Owned a silver 2014 Rav 4 XLS for 9+ years now. The best car I have ever owned to date just required to do regular oil and filter changes 2 brake jobs and routine maintenance. Very good on gas consumption compared to my GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherooke!"
"07 15, 2022",Not recommend for anybody,My stereo system keep showing loading signals and then blackout. It’s completely not working. Called Toyota made a complaint and no solution. Lots people having the same issue. They have to have a recall on that. Worst customer service in Toyota. I will never buy it. I will not recommend Toyota to anybody either
"03  3, 2022",Toyota RAV4 2014,"Best cat I've ever had almost up to 450,000 Kilometres and have had no problems. It's never broke down and the Sports mode is a Beast."
"04  8, 2021",Toyota is for everv and reasonable price,It’s a good car reliable comfort easy to use and drive trustable  smooth spacious three option of speed and low gas consumtion per hundred mile.
"03 31, 2021",Best car I've owned since 1982,This car is simply fabulous in every way!!!!! :)  I feel safe and comfortable and I finally have a radio that works! Could not be happier.
"09 14, 2020",Very fast,I love my car it the ride fit for mi and my family and is good in gas too and very comfortable nice in side
"08 18, 2020",The best car I've owned.,"Toyota RAV4 is a very good compact SUV, and it's easy to see why it's one of the best-selling nameplates in the United States. It delivers impressive fuel economy and comes loaded with plenty of standard features. This Toyota also has an upscale, roomy interior."
"07 19, 2020",Nicest used Cari have ever owned.,This car net all my needs. As a tall-ish guy this car offered a lot of interior room and leg space. It has great gas mileage and handles nicely.
"07 14, 2020",Once I go back  home for good I will buy the same!,"This car was very good for me. I need to sell it Because I'm going back home for good. I will buy the same car for sure!
Money saver.. only 4 cylinder!"
"03  4, 2020",Great value in a sport ute,"Styling, comfort and reliability fully met Toyota expectations.  Fuel economy is a bit less than hoped, but security of 4x4 drive in severe Winter conditions worthwhile.  It’s everything from a grocery getter to regular commuter.  Even gets occasional light duty off-road use on fishing and hunting trips."
"02 27, 2020",Never Letting this one go!!,"I got my 2014 in late 2017 as I was in the process of a divorce and working 2 jobs. Traded in my 2012 Corolla for this. The Vechile is now 6 years old and the suspension and steering still feel like brand new, mine is a base model LE with a Sport and Eco Mode. The Eco Mode on mine I find to limiting, (best if you’re going on a long trip with a low speed limit not during Rush hour at best.) Sport Mode on the other hand is a dream come true driving. The Interior after helping my mom boy her ‘13, my ex-husband buy a ‘15 and my best friend buy a ‘17 does feel a bit on the cheaply made side.  But apart from that it’s wonderful! My Rav has AWD, Traction control, and (thankfully it became standard) a backup camera."
"01 29, 2020",Great vehicle,Great vehicle with lots of room. It is easy to drive and handle. Has lots of room in back for wheelchair or other needed items.
"01 28, 2020",Third RAV4 in the family,"Just purchased a used '11 RAV4 for our daughter to join the '04 and '14 RAV4s already in the family. Great reliability, good gas mileage, compact/easy to maneuver and park, good safety...what's not to like. Because I'm a large guy, slightly bigger seats would be nice, but hardly a show-stopper. Also, I really enjoy all of the additional ""luxury"" items included in my '14 Limited edition, e.g., AWD, blind side monitor, back-up camera, XM radio, heated seats, bluetooth, auto headlights."
"01 21, 2020",2014 RAV radio issues,"My 2014 Rav 4 stereo just went out!!  The bluetooth began to kick on and off a few days ago,  I thought is was issues with my phone."
"01  8, 2020",Meet my expectation in every way,"I owned this car since 2014. The front seat at least for a smaller person (5'6"") is comfy, though an adjustable lumbar support would make the seat better.Engine power is enough to easily get up to speed on most interstate ramps.  Gas mileage is not better than advertised except on long flat runs in the mid 60 mph range, then I get 35mpg or better.  This car has very usable load room. I had many long trips with family and it's best car."
"01  5, 2020","Attractive, functional, reliable, affordable",The perfect car for getting around town comfortably.  Comfortable ride and lots of room inside.  Brand new tires and battery.  Very solid gas mileage and handles great city or highway.
"12 21, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,This car met all my needs. I absolutely love it. It is beautiful on the inside and outside. I am so glad I chose a Rav4.
"11 25, 2019",Good investment for 30k,"This car is reliable, durable, well made for small family or single person. Trunk space is adequate. Features plentiful. The car handles well in highway traffic. Gears change smoothly. Ride is comfortable. One car seat is goid and two would be capacity."
"11 21, 2019",Great all purpose vehicle,"Excellent suspension and road compatibility.  Easy to handle and delivers a smooth, comfortable ride. My wife especially loves the RAV feeling very safe while driving it."
"11  4, 2019",Love the  performance o and reliability of Toyotas,Thi vehicle is not new to us. We just upgraded from a 2009 to a 2014 in the same color etc. We like the reliability.
"10 27, 2019",Excellent Value,This car is very nice and comfortable. For the value you can’t find a better car like RAV4. They are reliable and make a great family vehicle.
"09 27, 2019",Versatile and Reliable,"Full disclosure:  I used to sell Toyota, Buick, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks.  For my money, Toyota offers extreme reliability at a reasonable cost. My 3014 RAV4 was Toyota Certified with 35,000 miles on the odometer.  Two and a half years later the RAV4 has 90,000 plus miles. The SUV still runs and looks like new. I have done only routine maintenance, replaced original equipment tires with Michelins and replaced the radio with a Kenwood model that featured Apple CarPlay. This RAV4 was as close to a good investment as any car or truck I ever purchased."
"06 10, 2019",5 years never any mechanical issues. Great car!,"I am a big guy. This car is very comfortable to drive with plenty of legroom. Family loves it for long trips to the mountains and beach.  Also plenty of room in the trunk for all my families grocery, toys and if you need even more room like bringing home 20 bags of bark from the garden supply store just make rear seat flat."
"05 20, 2019",It’s Toyota got to be reliable! Enjoying the Ride,"This car meets our needs very reliable comfortable ride ! Great on gas, would recommend same vehicle to friends and family . For a used vehicle and of course a Toyota you know your getting a great car. The 2014 Rav 4 is great and it was a one owner car well taken car of we are now a Toyota family along with my Tundra. Looking to purchase another Tundra or Tacoma soon and passing my used Tundra down to my son."
"04 13, 2019",best car i vere owned,this car meets our need good leg room good gas mileage lots of power rear seats lay down for extra cargo space sun roof towing package if you need it
"04  8, 2019",Very nice vehicle I love it,This vehicle was just what I was looking for. I have owned Volvo’s  this vehicle is just as nice and very easy to drive  love it
"03 27, 2019",Great vehicle,"Plenty of room, easy to get in and out of.  Seats are comfortable.  Love the back up camera, the Bluetooth feature easy to handle and good on gas"
"02  9, 2019",Things gone bad,Radio quit working after warranty expired.  Car was less than 3 years old.  Toyota is not standing by their product and won't replace it even though this is a common problem.  Now transmission fluid is leaking.  Car is a lemon!
"01 30, 2019",Pontiac vibe,You cannot go wrong with the Toyota engine very dependable good on gas all wheel drive is the way to go with the 1.8 engine
"01  9, 2019",I like RAV4 limited owsam. Car I like everything,Really good family car  it has all the features that we need to make our life luxury  plus previous owner installed Remot Startar  i recommend everyone one to buy limited rav4
"01  2, 2019",Toyota reliability is nearly unmatched,"I purchased this vehicle to be my personal take me to the mountains, rivers, golf course, etc.  It has been totally reliable and given good comfort doing it.  On long trips I get better than advertised gas mileage."
"12 23, 2018",Disappointing!,"Too many issues...been serviced only at  Griffin ...radio/stereo quit working and all door locks do not work!!  Only 41,000 miles!!!!  Very dissatisfied and disappointed in problems and cost to tepair issues that should have not even been an issue with such a new car!!!"
"12  5, 2018",Lots of road noise,When we drove it a little sluggish when asked to get up to freeway speed and enough road noise anyone in the back seat couldn't hear.
"11 27, 2018",coolest most reliable car I have owned !!!,I needed a car that was AWD and simple - this rides on the snow like a snow mobile especially if you add snow tires...gas mileage is great and style is perfect for me !!! I love em' so much I bought a second !!!
"11  4, 2018",Most best value car i ever owned,This car exhibited all my needs. One of the best value price car. Design is really great. Very comfortable car. Most successful car from Toyota for the reasonable price
"10 15, 2018",reliable and lots of room,"This vehicle has definitely met my needs being roomy, all wheel drive and I am able to use the racks on top for transporting my kayaks  and by the way, I love the color."
"10  2, 2018",Can't compare to any other small SUV,"We looked for several other cars before getting this RAV4. We compared to a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and Honda CRX. But none of those cars compares to our Toyota. We love how smooth it is to drive, how fuel efficient it is, the cargo space has no comparison and even though we own an LE (lowest trim), the interior is very comfortable, and it has almost every accommodation that the competitors' mid trims have (except the automatic lights)"
"08  8, 2018",A nice and reliable car to own,It is really good for me with all my needs. I will buy the newest model to have the best and latest accessories every one is longing for.
"07 18, 2018",Zippy dependable commuter and traveling vehicle.,Owned the car for four years.  I love how it handles and quickly accelerates.  The ride could be smoother and quieter.  I never had to take it to the shop for anything other than maintenance.
"06 27, 2018","Easy to buy, own, resell","On second RAV4. Great mileage for an SUV non-hybrid. Excellent acceleration in Economy mode, never mind Sport. Roomy enough for four adults . Lots of storage."
"06 23, 2018",We are a Toyota Family,This was an easy choice.  Toyota is a great brand and we know we can always count on the car!!  Thanks for being there for the family.
"06 22, 2018",Versatility is the best of all cars owned.,"This car has usability that prior cars could never equal, with the rear seats being able to push all the way down flat. This allows extending the cargo area enough to carry items most cars would not be able to. Yet, it's smaller in length, so it fits nicely into smaller spaces."
"06  4, 2018",Most comfortable Automobile I have owned.,"I found myself in need of a vehicle that will perform well in snow due to job location change.
The Rav4 has exceeding my expectations for comfort and has performed very well in snow.
My job is at one of the higher elevations and at the top of the hill...I see many vehicles sliding
when it snows and I have had no problem at all."
"05 30, 2018",Disappointed but I don?t hate the car,I wish I shopped around more and looked and more cars in the same class. It took me a little while and I started to find this this car really lacked!
"05 26, 2018",Most reliable car ever,This car makes me drive like a boss as I just stated my own business I would like to have this rav4 do that I can never worry about breakdowns
"05 24, 2018",Great suv,The RAV4 is a great suv. I bought it because I needed a bigger car than my Camry when I got a dog and bought a house. The 75lb pup has room and I have room for transporting yard clean up to the dump. Because of my raves about this car 2 of my friends are now happy RAV4 owners.
"05 19, 2018",Love my Rav4,"Great cargo space. Love the backup camera, steering wheel controls for audio and bluetooth. Deep cup holders so bottles won't rattle around and plenty of storage for all the things I keep in the car. Bought it at a great dealership - A1 Toyota in New Haven CT. Wouldn't shop anywhere else."
"05 16, 2018",Best car i have ever driven.,This car is reliable and comfortable to drive. It holds its value and feels very safe driving in the winter weather. Only car I will ever own.
"05  3, 2018",I have always wanted to own one.,"Overall I am pleased. Improvements could be made on quality of interior. A storage compartment on the dash for a cell phone or transponder. Also, better floor mats."
"04 21, 2018",I got exactly what I was told i will be getting.,The vehicle was in excellent condition and the price was also less than average market value. Due to the low price i did not even had to bargain
"03 30, 2018",Love my RAV,"My sister recommended the RAV and I really like mine.  I've driven it almost 100,000 km since 2015 and would definitely buy another one.  Gas mileage is great with my 4 cylinder engine.  No blind spots when you change lanes compared to my Ford Escape.  Never had one issue with it in the 3 years I've owned it."
"03 21, 2018",We're on our 2nd Rav4 and most likely to #3?,The Rav4 is the perfect vehicle for us. There's plenty room for whatever you do. The rear seats fold down for even more cargo space. Dependability is just another reason we love our Toyota.
"03 20, 2018","I love Toyota, and I especially love my 2014 Rav4","The Rav4 is well priced for its comfort, options and performance.  It drives and handles like a much more expensive vehicle, is super dependable and a very comfortable ride."
"03  7, 2018",Review of 2014 Toyota RAV4,"Would prefer armrests for long driving.  - Hoped I would get 30 mpg on long trips. Am near but not quite able to accomplish that yet. - Very comfortable for long periods in car.  Car suspension system especially comfortable.  - Have added a hitch, crossbars for roof rack, fog lights to increase usefulness of this car.  Wish seats would fold forward completely to leave a flat surface in the back of the car.  As it is there is a slight incline where the seats fall forward. -  All driving apparatus near at hand and their use is not difficult to grasp for the first-time driver.  Wish car's odometer would always show (it doesn't) when looking for other available readings such as current mpg, average mpg, Trip A, Trip B, etc.  - Am a hard marker so I think the 4 stars I have given is a very high rating for the car.    5 Stars might have been given but for the exceptions mentioned above."
"03  1, 2018",Adore my Rav 4,"Perfect size, great features, drives like a dream and is very comfortable. So glad I found this vehicle. It?s perfect! Even used its rock solid."
"02 27, 2018",Very smooth ride.,"I have only owned this vehicle for a few weeks but so far I love it. It rides smooth and has a sleek design.
If I were to have recommended an improvement it would be to improve the quality of the interior."
"02 13, 2018",Beautiful Car,I love this car. It is so nice inside and out. I bought it used and it has held up its value vary nicely. I would buy it again.
"02  7, 2018",Not the most reliable,"I've driven this car for three years now, we are at 85,000 km and the transmission is now failing. Any one having the same problem?"
"02  2, 2018",I love my RAV4,RAV4 is a great car for travel and to cruise around town. It is spacious and comfortable and I am enjoying every bit of it.
"01 31, 2018",I love RAV-4 Toyota,"It is confortable, cute, economic. And is perfect for women like me. It is not expensive and  I can fell sure driving far away or I. Express way for it estabity."
"01 29, 2018",Multi functional car.,The rav is zippy around town and gets 22 mpg as rated.  The all wheel drive works great in the snow.  I can haul a six foot step ladder with the rear seats down.  Tall adults can ride comfortably in the back seat.  I have gotten 31mpg on the highway.
"01 17, 2018",Very reliable car.,"I very seldom drive it, my wife drives the majority of the time. The size of the vehicle is much easier for to drive. Previously owned a GMC Acadia she didn't like the vehicle to big."
"01  9, 2018",Best Car Ever!!!,I had wanted a Rav 4 for a long time and now that I have one I am not disappointed!  This car handles the road well under any conditions.  I am very happy with the 29 mpg it gets.  It is very comfortable for long distance trips  both front and back with lots of leg room.  It has a spacious cargo area that I use constantly.  The interior feels very luxurious especially with all the features that came on this model.  When it is time for a new vehicle I will definitely get another Toyota Rav 4!
"12 30, 2017",LOVE my RAV 4's!!!,"Just upgraded to this vehicle....I've owned 2 others and never looked back! Excellent performance & handling, roomy, comfortable and safe for my 16 year old daughter to drive!!"
"12 28, 2017",this rav 4 has nore room inside than you think,"the rav4 is great on gas for being a awd car it has comfortable room for someone who is 6'5  and i have alot of leg room and for people in the back seats it has alot of room as well ,and when you put the seats down you haul a good amount of things as well"
"12 11, 2017",Great Car,This car met my needs.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and the back.  It rides nice and goes great in the snow.  I'm really enjoying the car.
"12  1, 2017",Love this car!,We purchased this car in October and it is great. It was a great value relative to other comparable? vehicles and we love it.
"11 29, 2017",RAV4 owner,"I purchased this car almost a year ago, after having an older model RAV4.  I love love love this car."
"11 11, 2017",the most reliable car i have owned is the one i'm,i like it because it's good on gas. it's comfortable all the way around. we go on long rides now and i don't have to get out half way threw the trip.
"11 10, 2017",AMAZING,Just bought one it is gorgeous. Cannot wait to drive my new car!!!!! The sunroof is an awesome buying feature!
"11 10, 2017",Great relialablity,Great driving enjoy the heated seats and sun roof. Electric rear hatch is easy to use and very useful.
"11 10, 2017",2012 and older were built much better,Car is just okay very disappointed after owning a 2012 rave 4 quality was sacrificed for cheaper plastics to get more fuel mileage
"11  2, 2017",My first smaller car,It met all my needs. I got good gas mileage with it. I had no problems and service was great. They did all the paper work when I bought the car.
"11  2, 2017","I leased this car new, liked it so  I bought it.","Easy to drive, easy to park. Service was great. the only problem I had was when I bought it at the end of my lease I had to wait about 5 weeks to get my title to register the after I had paid for it in full"
"10 24, 2017",Relability+,Great highway vehicle. Great fuel economy coupled with plenty of engine power. Enough goodies to make the vehicle enjoyable.
"10 22, 2017",Love my Rav4,"We love this car.  Runs great, good gas mileage and dependable.  Lots of room.  Love the back seat laying down so we can carry things.  Would recommend."
"10 21, 2017",my first car,The car met all of my needs.  It is very comfortable for me. I am driving every day to my work and bask.
"10 21, 2017",Love my RAV4!',"This car is better than I expected! Meets all my needs and is a pleasure to drive. Highly recommended to family and friends. Dealership New Country Toyota, Westport CT, and especially Nick (sales) and Jessica (service)"
"10 11, 2017",Most reliable SUV on the market.,Most reliable SUV on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"09 16, 2017",Great AWD small SUV,"We wanted an AWD, small SUV with decent gas mileage and great reliability. This car checks all the boxes! We owned a Subaru Forrester in the past; it was good but not quite as reliable."
"09 10, 2017",Best alround car on the market,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)"
"09  6, 2017",Love all the safety options,I love the way this vehicle handles. It is very cost efficient with great fuel mileage. Love the roominess in the inside for a small SUV.
"09  6, 2017","RAV4 Limited -AWD, xtra security features, loaded!",Excellent reliable and top model car with technology package included.  Hard to find Limited models with the technology package and blizzard pearl exterior with two tone interior: black/cinnamon.
"09  3, 2017",Great small SUV,"Love this car, plenty of room, power when needed and good on fuel. I've owned several Toyota's and I like this one the most."
"08 29, 2017",So far so good,"I haven't owned the car long, but it has been a good car so far. I would recommend it to people looking for a good midsize vehicle."
"08 29, 2017",Really good suv,I think that's one of the best and most reliable car I've ever owned. I really like it. Never had any issues with it.
"08 22, 2017",Couldn't be happier with my choice,"This car fits all of my needs. The back seat offers great leg room suitable for my in-laws who are over 6ft tall. The dual-zone climate control is a great feature that is included in the XLE. Backup cameras come standard and are super helpful for safety and parallel parking. I feel so safe in this vehicle and have no worries when my wife drives to work. The seats can wear you down a little bit on road trips over 3 hours long. However, once you find the way you like the seat you won't have a problem; it took me one trip to figure out just how to adjust the seat to make it fit my needs perfectly. You won't regret buying this vehicle. Another plus is that you can get fuel economy of 30+ mpg on highway driving!"
"08 10, 2017",Rideshare customers love this vehicle,"As a senior citizen, this  vehicle and all the items I was looking for in a new car including  rear camera, side mirror turn signal's, plenty of cupholders, fog lamps.  Unfortunately, hybrid technology was not available in the RAV 4 in 2014.  Rideshare customers love the roominess and comfort of the vehicle, and so do I."
"08  7, 2017",I love this car!!!!!,This was the best car for me. I'm so happy I used the service to find the most ideal vehicle for me. I found everything I wanted in the car. Thank you thank you thank you!!!
"08  7, 2017",RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION,"YOU CANT BEAT A TOYOTA FOR ALL AROUND QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I ONLY FILLED UP THE GAS TANK EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND I DROVE AROUND A LOT."
"08  5, 2017",Love my Rav4,"I just purchased my Rav4 this week.  So far I couldn't ask for a better vehicle.  It is roomy, comfortable, smooth riding and just all around perfect for me."
"08  4, 2017",Love my Rav4!!,"I've just had it a few days, but I love it!!  I have been wanting one for a long time.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  Can't wait to travel with it."
"08  3, 2017","Spacious, sporty and fun","We test drove three different cars before landing on our RAV4. We chose it because of the options of Eco Mode and Sport Mode for driving, the AWD capabilities, the absolute comfort both front and back, the look, the interior, and of course the Toyota brand! So happy to have a Toyota back in my life!"
"08  3, 2017",Sound system computer died,I am very disappointed.  I had my car less than 5 months and the radio system went out and I was told I would have to pay 800 for a new one.
"08  3, 2017",Go For The Limited,"Love the drivability of the RAV4. Once I found one with a black exterior & then experienced the interior of a Limited trim level, it was all over. I knew I had found the perfect car for me."
"07 31, 2017",Most Stylish Car I've Owned,"I have driven RAV4s before, but never one this stylish. The interior has 2-tone softex leather-trimmed seats that are not only the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but also a thing of beauty!!! It handles incredibly well and, even though it is 3 years old, it looks and handles like a brand new car. Toyota's are the best!"
"07 28, 2017",Very fun to drice,"Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love it. It drives very well and has been very reliable so far. I really like the interior design"
"07 28, 2017",Sit back and enjoy the ride,Great features on the interior. Loved the power seats that were also heated seats. 2nd row seat that reclines. Perfect size for everyday commute.
"07 24, 2017",Best car to upgrade to!,"This car is the ultimate vehicle - lots of space/leg room, great mpg for an SUV, just overall the best car I've ever owned! Highly recommend the RAV4 to anyone looking for a new car, you will not be disappointed!"
"07 23, 2017",Has power,This vehicle has power and keeps it's value. It is a Toyota by the way.  Lots of cup holders!   Very cute Suv and very reliable
"07 13, 2017",It's a Toyota!,"This is my second RAV4 and fifth Toyota overall. First RAV4 (2009) I put over 120K on it with only routine maintenance and two sets of tires. Traded for a Subaru Impreza hatchback but was not happy with it (to small). Traded Subaru for 2014 RAV4 love the looks and the size very happy, I will never own anything but Toyota! Keep up routine maintenance and Toyota will last forever."
"07  2, 2017","New owner, a leased vehicle 2 years old. Used.",",Still getting used to it, my immediate negatives were lack of storage spaces around the cabin and arm resting places while driving.  Visually there are more blind spots than I am used to, but I say that is more my adjustment than the car.  Road noise is sort of  loud, but I hit a different patch of concrete and total silence.  Is it tires or something else?  I don't have a complaint about zippy, cuz the car will adjust to your desire. I had a Montero Sport 6 cyl with the same HP and had to drive  1200 Lbs more. Positives.  I like the Blue tooth,  radio controls on the steering column.  The fuel consumption meters, backup camera, and the SPACE OVERALL. One other thing is the dash trim has a reflective surface with the sun, sort of a chrome shine."
"06 23, 2017",Love it,"The Rav4 drives smoothly, is very comfortable and has awesome features. I would highly recommend it."
"06 15, 2017",my little dream suv,"Love the whole pkg...from color to size, comfort, gas mileage. sporty looking . The Interior being black and brown called Terracotta sealed my love for it."
"06 12, 2017",Great Reliable SUV at a great price,"I'm a tall fellow at 6'4"" and the Rav4 LE fits me just fine. The right console is designed just right so my knee can rest comfortably. The Safety features are great, as is the gas mileage for an SUV. The only cons that I've found so far is there is some road noise over rough surfaces and the lack of android auto/ability to show google maps on the LED screen for navigation."
"06  3, 2017",Nice interior and exterior plus reliable,I really like  toyota Rav4. It is nice exterior and nice interior even though some are disappoint me.
"05 31, 2017",Toyotas most reliable the only cars i buy,I love my RAV4 XLE  I am comfortable and its just the right size. I wish it had GPS and an alert signal for when I am going to change lanes.
"05 31, 2017",Very reliable stylish car,Very reliable stylish car. Excellent coverage under Toyota care. The car is very comfortable and spacious and suitable for road trips as it is good on mileage.
"05 30, 2017",2013 RAV4 XLE,"The RAV4 XLE is a great value for the money. Looking for a smaller SUV, this is it.  2013 and newer has so many more options, from Bluetooth to a backup camera."
"05 23, 2017",comfortable and sleek looking,"So far, love this car.
 Cars.com had a great variety in my area. Response was immediate.Dealer was informative and helpful. Made the purchase easy."
"05 23, 2017",Great styling and reliability,Reliable vehicle with spacious and well laid out interior. Good gas mileage. Put a hitch on it and planning to tow a small boat and installed bike rack.  Great family car.
"05 21, 2017",So far so good,Just what my wife needed! Easy to get in and out of! Plenty of room for grandkids and gardening hobby.....
"05 17, 2017",I am loving my choice!,"I was able to test drive three vehicles and purchased the Toyota Rav4 XLE! Love this vehicle! It handles well, very comfortable, nice interior and great on gas.  The navigation and bluetooth ability is definitely a plus! The ECO or Sport mode option when driving is excellent! One of my better decisions in purchasing a vehicle."
"05  3, 2017",Great car for the money,"I've only had this car for a little bit but so far it's been great.  Great on gas for a crossover SUV, looks sharp, handles well and has that Toyota reliability!  A lot more spacious than it looks from the outside.  The AWD will be handy once winter hits again in here in the midwest.  It is a quiet ride also!  Great little car all around.  So far so good."
"04 24, 2017",Somewhat disappointed,"I leased a standard model RAV4 three years ago, and when deciding whether to take the car I was bothered by dumb changes they have made to the interior, plus I wasn't thrilled with the exterior design either. And today I feel the same way. For instance, they moved the cup holders so that one is under the dash making it hard to get out. There is no longer a tray in the mid-seat compartment. There is still a compartment over the glove box, but they omitted the door that would go over it. There is no light over the front cup holder and adjacent areas. To turn on the overhead lights you have to feel around for a switch instead of just tapping on the light as before. Etc. All pretty annoying if you've owned an earlier RAV4. Door keys on the earlier model design you could easily feel the buttons, whereas the new style you cannot. I'm not crazy about the lift-up rear door, but that's just me. These things still annoy me after three years of having the car, so much so that I'm thinking of trading down to an earlier model. Performance is good, including the new transmission. It's still a good vehicle, I just think they made some real mistakes in the design. I would have given the car higher reliability rating if I had not had to do a near-complete brake job a few days ago."
"04 22, 2017",Navigation screen,I own a 2014 rav4 limitted. After 2 years of using the nav screen keeps on rebooting. When i went to toyota to have it fix but the cust service said that they cant fix the screen because it is not a toyota product I was so disappointed. My vehicle is out of warranty and im willing to pay for repair.  I will never go for toyota again.
"04 11, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,me and my family  love this car because Toyota is great. Thats why we love the rav4. It is really good for children
"04  1, 2017",Decent car,I had this car for three years. The road noise was loud but it drove really well in the snow!  Overall it was a good car but my family needed something bigger
"03 24, 2017","Excellent aerodinamic, economic in gas","Good I recommend it. If you can afford a hybrid, get it. very good in gas, excellent in sport mode if you wanna get away fast. The entertainment system is not good, cheap, a pain to upgrade, and only navigation in full loaded."
"03 10, 2017",RAV4 Limited,"I love this vehicle though I am open-minded. I am on the lookout for a similar/different vehicle that is very reliable, comfortable and has economical gas consumption."
"03  7, 2017",I had a RAV4 for 10 years. I love this one too,I had a 2006 RAV4 and then went to a Camry for the last year and a half. It was so low to the ground and just wasn't me. I love the room and comfort of the RAV4
"02 10, 2017",Toyota Rav 4 2014,Bought my rav 4 brand new in 2014 jan.1 year later i noticed colour change in my moulding looking like burnt patches.Filled a claim with Toyota which they declined to replace and told me i will have to pay for it.Now we are in 2017 the patches have continue to increase.Six months ago my radio just stopped working again i went to Toyota and reported all they said was i need to replace a new radio.It keeps reloading then goes off again and again.I have noticed this is a common problem with toyota.I am a very dissatisfied and disappointed customer.Am still paying for car.
"01  9, 2017",Radio Issues,My radio recently went out on my Toyota Rav 4. I haven't even owned  the vehicle for three years. I am over on miles so the warranty is void. The dealership wants 1200 dollars to replace my existing radio with a refurbished radio. I have checked the internet and this seems to be a defect with the system.
"12 19, 2016",2014 Red Toyota Rav4 LE,I bought my Toyota Rav4 as a certified Pre-Owned and it never disappointed me. The car is very smooth and definitely recommend to others.
"10 23, 2016",It's not a Porsche,"Awesome car for the money. If you are looking for top of the line quality leather, and you can't live without another cup holder, buy a Lexus. If you need speed,  buy a Porsche.  If you want style, and want to look like you know what you're spong, buy this Rav 4. And stop borrowing your grandmother's Buick!"
"09  1, 2016",Radio/Bluetooth,Have had my 2014 Toyota RAV 4 into the dealership 3 times with radio/bluetooth problems and it is still not fixed. The first time the radio was stuck on a station and I could not control volumn. Took it to dealership and they said it was a computer upgrade. Picked up the car and then the blue tooth was not working and constantly flashes connect/disconnect they said they fixed it again. Picked it up and still not working so took it back to dealer and they say they will replace the entire radio. Get it back with the new radio and still not working. Now they will not call me back to get it in again and it will be a week tomorrow since I picked it up and called them on 8/27/2016 saying it is still not working. Besides this problem they sold me a clear coat on the paint and scotch guard for inside and it seems like the paint chips even worse than any other car I've ever owned. The ride is not smooth and feels like you're in a truck when you go over bumps. I bought the car new in 2014 but I probably won't be hanging onto it for much longer.
"01  2, 2016",Rav4 a good bet,"I was shopping at end of year for 2013-2014 AWD vehicle with hatchback. I test drove the Subaru Outback , Toyota Rav4 Limited, Ford Escape SE and Titanius and Honda CRV touring. For the money and features the Toyota was the best buy. I will say the Honda was the smoothest ride and the Ford had the best engine performance. The Toyota was in-between these two for performance and comfort. The sport mode did give it better performance and the eco mode is nice for basic driving. Subaru Outback was not as good driving and I was surprised. Looking at the XLE and Limited in my view the Limited is worth it (~2-3K more on the used model). The limited has better seats and comfort. Also just more stand items included. Some have complained on the Bluetooth system. It works with my iphone 5 just fine and the dealer showed me a few tricks. The nav system is not the greatest, but not a big deal for me. since I like to use my phone anyway (included with limited so I have it). The interior lighting is a bit for for the switches but not a show stopper.

Things I really liked were visibility, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, drivers seat adjustments., AWD, handling and overall power."
"10  8, 2015",i hate this piece,I rented this car and I was NOT impressed. Everyone was saying the same thing.. S it has backseat recliners wow.. I would buy the Ford Escape or the X Trail or the CRV or something else I can't believe I rented this... I hate Toyota cars because they are extremely boring and timeless...Their parts are expensive and the don't last as long as you think
"09 30, 2015",2014 rav 4,Never enjoyed a day with my 2014 rav 4. So regretted buying it. The ride is the worst I have ever experienced causing my central nervous system to take a hit. Toyota says thats how they are built.
"09 25, 2015","Great vehicle, overall","I own a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD. Pros: Stable, comfortable ride with a relatively smooth and well-behaved 6-speed automatic transmission. Back-up camera is fantastic. Rear leg room is massive, especially compared to a sedan of equal length. The rear seats recline, which is great. The heated seats are phenomenal. The AWD system, brakes, and traction control make this vehicle feel extremely steady in poor, wintery conditions. It surprised me how well it all works. Cons: Cheap plastic around shifter lever. Rear styling is weird. The tail lights are odd-looking, and the button to release the rear hatch is far too high. Engine is very weak. I would have bought a V6 if it were still available. Overall, it's a great little SUV. It has a good balance of utility, size, and car-like handling. Just don't buy this vehicle if you're looking for something exciting to drive. It's not for people who value performance."
"09 16, 2015",Overated but Good Space and MPG,"Pros:
Nice Cargo Space for Mini SUV.
Good MPG.
Fairly quiet ride.

Cons:
Blind Spots due to High Metal doors and tailgate. Very Loud Interior Rumble when back windows are open. Uncomfortable seat after one hour of driving. Lack of true recreation assistance features. Lightweight aluminum doors dent very easily. Tailpipe and muffler hang down like they forgot to plan for it. No way to tie down tailgate when transporting large items with tailgate open. No way to shut off annoying beeper when tailgate is open. Tiny tiny arm rest storage box. Integrated voice calling and stereo need improvement.

Summary
A bit disappointed. I would not purchase a RAV4 again."
"08 31, 2015",terrible interioal finish,Just want to let every one knows rav4 has terrible and unacceptable defects in the interioal finish. to look at the joint between windshield and top and you can see how rough the job they have done.that is really unacceptable!!!!!!! looks just like junk !!! not understand why they made rav4 like this. I checked other cars there is no one make this joint like rav4
"08 17, 2015",Excellant car,"Lots of Space, great gas mileage, dependable, good dealer network. The wind noise very noticeable at freeway speeds specially when going over 75mph. But good outward visibility, smooth breaking, and powertrain is smooth and efficient"
"07  1, 2015",Unrepairable Air conditioner (AC),"Car is beautiful over all,
but it has stinky Air conditioner. And Toyota refuse to fix it under warranty. IT costs about 160$ every 3-4 months to have it deodorizer and change cabin filter."
"04  7, 2015",rav 4 negatives,"I purchased a 2014 rav4 on Nov 3, 2014. The xle model is great looking but not knowing the rating on the vehicle I did purchase the full 5yr 100,000 extra warraty. Now for the negatives as follows:
1. The speed indicator is off a solid two miles an hour and I hope I don't get a speeding ticket.
2. Too much glare on the screen in middle of dash.
3. This one makes me balistic - The bluetooth system really sucks, sucks, and sucks some more. I had it to the dealer and he said my problem is the brand of phone I have-bull ! I have a 2013 Chevy Silverado and the phone works the was it should on the bluetooth system so it's not my phone. This is how bad it is - When I receive a call after around two minutes the connectivety is lost and will not return until I pull off the road and shut the car off and wait two minutes and restart the car and then it returns. I don't care what brand of car from the most costly to the least that's just plain discusting. I was looking at a Chevy Equinox and only if I would have know I would be driving one. I will never buy another new car without test driving the bluetooth.
4. The dealer has the unliest dealer stickers ever that they put on the car and I just had to remove it."
"02 20, 2015",Lynch Toyota Manchester Ct,"I recently bought a 2014 Rav 4 LTD,
on the day I was picking up my Rav 4, Eduardo explained in great detail how to use Auto High Beam, Lane Departure Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and plus Entune Premium JBL Audio with Navigation Multimedia App Suite, and connecting my I Phone including my address book and music.
Yesterday had a problem with my music not connected, called and Eduardo was on a trip to New York, he called later in the afternoon, set up appointment in the evening and this problem was corrected in 5 minuets.
Lynch Toyota is very lucky to have this terrific person on
their team."
"01 11, 2015",Overall Pleased,"We rented this vehicle for a trip from Florida to California and back. We spent 3 weeks and 5800 miles in it. Two adults and probably 400 lbs of cargo. I found the gas mileage around home (35-55 mph with few lights) was around 34 mpg. On the road at 75 mph we got 27ish mpg on 10% ethanol and 28+ on pure gas. At 70 mph it gave 28.5ish on ethanol and 30-31 on real gas and at 65 it was 29 on ethanol and 32-33 on pure gas. Around L.A. (the city of cars & traffic) we averaged 24.5. Overall we got 28+ mpg. for the trip. 28 heading west and 28.5 going east. I found the wind affected the mileage greatly. For 2 adults it was fine. Rode comfortably. When the adult kids were with us we found issues with the back seat belts not wanting to release. The cup holders in the back are not very user friendly either. For my wife and I, I would consider buying one of these. If we had younger kids I would still consider it. For a family with teens, I'm not so sure. One thing I found I did not like but I got used to was the hood flexed and bounced around. I thought it wasn't latched tight, but it was."
"01  1, 2015",Love this SUV,"We really love this car and it's a Toyota. I worked at a GM dealer for 40 years as a mechanic so do know my cars. Previously owned a 2004 Pontiac Vibe which really was a Toyota Matrix with Pontiac badges. It was a fantastic car with no problems in 135,000 miles. Bad move GM as we loved the Vibe so much that when it came time to replace the Vibe GM had quit making them. We would have purchased a Matrix but Toyota quit making them also. Bad move Toyota. Had made up our minds to purchase a Subaru Outback but having seen way too many bad reviews on them using oil. Took a Rav4 for a test drive and loved it. Live in Montana and the AWD is amazing for getting around on the snow/icy roads. It gives almost too much confidence on how well it handles horrible roads. Was going tonight put snow tires on but it would have been wasted moneys because it goes anywhere with the factory highway tires. I could nitpick but all the great features make up for everything."
"12 20, 2014",Poor Cabin Design,"We are leasing a Rav 4. As with most cars you have to live with it a while to see short comings. The interior has many flaws, poor location for many switches which cannot be accessed without contortions. Very poor interior lighting, especially in the rear. The bottom of the doors collect mud and snow leaving your clothes a mess as well as the garage floor. No illumination for controls located on the door. The heated seats are not as effective as others I have owned. The gas tank is too small. The radio operation requires a Masters from MIT, hundreds of pages to the manual! I am glad I am leasing and not owning."
"10 23, 2014",My other Toyota experience is promising.,"This is a very good car for the money. Seems to be more economical than advertised. Practically noiseless, and well controllable."
"10 11, 2014",Navigation Blues,"I found the navigation screen almost impossible to use due to the glare. I have overcome this by using a $200. Garmin Nuvi, and stuck the suction onto a hockey puck then dropped the whole thing into the front cup holder. The power outlet is right there and the screen can be tilted toward the driver and is crystal clear regardless of bright sunlight. The puck fits snugly into the cup holder which is a convenient coincidence. As far as reading radio stations and other data, well that is still a problem for me, anyone got an idea?"
"10 10, 2014",Rav4 Ride!,Purchased 2014 Rav4 after comparing with other famous sports utility and been driving it for about 2 months now. Cabin is noisy and ride is bumpy!
"09 29, 2014",First time Toyota user,"this is the first time I have purchased a Toyota personally. I have had friends with them, but for me I have not owned one. So far, with the one month of use, I like the vehicle. I am a bit disappointed in the engine size but with time I hope to get use to it. On the highway it takes a bit to get the car moving..."
"09 23, 2014",Still learning,"Have owned the Rav4 for a month. We are very pleased with it so far. Ride and comfort are excellent. We are still learning what the car can do. The manual for electronics package alone is 200 pages. One small complaint, display screen is nearly flush with dash board and sometimes unreadable in bright sunlight."
"09 23, 2014",Nicest Car I have Ever Owned,"After reviewing rating online and consumer reports, I decided to see a Toyota Rav4 at the dealership. My husband and I found this vehicle to be everything we both were looking for in a sporty vehicle. Being that we like to do outdoor activities, Sunday drives, traveling, this vehicle provides everything we were looking for in a car. We purchase the XLE model that included the navigation. It has the sun roof, gps and other applications such as weather and traffic. It also has fog lights and many other features to make our trips enjoyable. We are very pleased with out purchase."
"09 18, 2014",bad MPG,"Dad MPG, this is my toyota, and i getting bad MPG 21 city; 26 hwy. love the radio and phone setup. at 4,000 miles. no problem."
"09 12, 2014",love my rav4,"It's really too early to give an impression of the things on the list, we just bought it yesterdqy. BUT, it was a replacement for a 2012 Rav 4 which was totaled in a MVA. Our 2012 was very reliable. Never had a bit of trouble with it. . I love Toyota!!"
"09  8, 2014",Make sure you're comfortable in the RAV4,"I've driven the RAV4 for about 1000 miles an overall I'm very happy, you as a prospective Rav 4 buyer compare the XLE and Limited for seat comfort. I find the armrest moves back-and-forth ""adjustable"" and sometimes is annoying and blocks the drink holder. Also a couple of the controls are in-conveniently placed above your left knee while sitting in the driver seat. I purchased the limited because I wanted blizzard pearl paint and I am very happy that I did I'm happy with all at this point after driving the thousand miles the liftgate is very convienient The pushbutton start is wonderful and the doorhandles lock and unlock is a very convenient feature. I would highly recommend the RAV4 for mileage and controls and drivability and I would recommend it to a friend"
"09  5, 2014",Good and bad.,"I just got a new 2014 RAV 4 Limited edition last month. I previously drove 2008 RAV 4 for 4 years and a 2012 Rave 4 XLE for 2 years. They are very reliable SUVs.

2014 RAV 4 Pro:
- Very reliable to drive during all season
- Easier to maneuver, turn and drive
- It has slightly better shock absorption capacity from uneven road than the previous models.
- Good mirrors that provide wider and better view of the road.
- Limited edition comes with lots of features, like back up camera, seat warmer etc.
- Good cargo space but less than the 2008 and 2012 models.
- Comes with two separate mats for winter and summer.
- Well priced for a SUV.

2014 RAV 4 Con:
- It has absolutely no leg space in the back passenger seats. It is impossible for normal height and tall people to seat comfortably at the back. It has less space than a normal sedan. The inside is tiny.
- The integrated software system for GPS and audio control is very bad and full of flaws.
- Consumes way more gas then the two previous models I drove.
- It has only two storage compartment at the front, smaller in size than the previous models. The previous models had multiple small compartments that were convenient to store things like sunglass, spare change for emergency and other electronic items like phones out of sight. The 2014 model have none of these. The compartment they made to keep phone is out in the open and every time the car stops even decelerating gradually, it slips and falls on the floor.
Overall, Toyota made 2014 RAV 4 cheap by cutting out all the useful, convenient little things. If you had a previous model with good features, don't change to this new model. If you are buying a RAV 4, buy a previous model with added features. I drove 2008 and 2012 models; they are very good, reliable cars with a better fuel mileage. If I had a Limited edition of 2012 RAV 4, I definitely would have kept it.
Good luck!"
"09  5, 2014",Third Toyota I've Owned,"I've been very satisfied with all 3 Toyotas I've had. I chose the RAV 4 because I needed a car large enough to hold a big dog crate (with the backseats down), but didn't want a huge SUV.
Had the car less than a month, but have been really happy with it."
"08 28, 2014",To Purchase or Not Purchase,"I own a 2014 XLE AWD. I've read the reviews and here are my thoughts:

Likes:
Flat, big cargo space for a little SUV.
MPG is what they claim... Hwy 29-32, City 24-28.
Bluetooth handless phone capability.
Control panel on steering wheel.

Dislikes:
Uncomfortable seat and head rest.
Blind spots due to high door design.
Heated seat option not available.
Glare on monitor screen.
Feels like a high center of gravity. Not stout.
Muffler and pipes visible.
Yes, the hood does bounce.
Funky cruise control post.
Lack of comfortable driver arm rests.
Yes, there is a vibration with windows open.
Unable to activate/deactivate all interior lights with one switch.

Recommendation:
I can't recommend this vehicle primarily because the seats are uncomfortable and there are too many blind spots due to high door design."
"08 22, 2014",Just fine,"I've owned this car for a month - 2014 xle. Purchased this over the Mazda CX-5 because of the price alone (Toyota has bargaining power. Mazda doesn't at this point). I've owned a lot of Toyotas and they all drive pretty much the same. The second I drove this car, I felt comfortable. It responds well, it feels exactly like other toyotas I've owned. I'm not, however, blown away. There is a crazy glare on the screen. I'm technologically savvy and the computer system organization doesn't make any freaking sense. I've read the manual, spent more time than I have on candy crush personalizing the navigation, and I still can't get a seamless experience when driving. The voice command doesn't understand me and I've tried to calibrate it multiple times. Other issues - I have to step back every time I open the back door and there aren't enough storage compartments (I used to own a 2 door Yaris with more small-storage space than this car). Those things aside - it's a toyota and has AMAZING resell value (My yaris depriciated $200 in 5 years) and amazing reliability and my dealer has a great service department. I'm not crazy about this car, but for the money and the company, it's a great choice."
"08 16, 2014",I Love my Rav 4,It's sporty and responsive. I can't imagine owning anything else. Everyone that has looked at it will be considering the Rav 4 for their next vehicle. Toyota makes such a great product!
"08 13, 2014",Best car that I can see out of really good,I can see out of this vehicle all around and love the backup camera.It rides a little like a truck but it has big wheels so that is probably the reason.All in all I like this vehicle.
"08  9, 2014",Overall excellent...some disappointments,"I bought this car to replace a well used and loved 2006 Highlander. The mileage in the RAV4 is substantially higher. It is not quite as large, but will do the job.

I've been driving it for almost a month and following are my comments.

Disappointments:
1. Noisy, jumpy ride
2. Terrible radio
3. No remote opener for garage doors (on top model)
4. No space for sunglasses and other odds and ends
5. Non locking glove compartment (!)
6. Overly complex electronics
7. Hard seats
8. Would like stronger headlights (as I have aged, my eyes get worse at night vision)

What I like:
1. It's a Toyota (dependable and effecient)
2. Nice looking vehicle
3. Decent cargo capacity
4. Power liftgate (reason I didn't consider CRV)"
"08  6, 2014",RAV 4,"Better equipment and technology than a Honda CRV. Trying to get adjusted to a smaller vehicle (sold Ram1500 4X4 Quad Cab) Not a solid as the Rm but better mileage. Choice was between Ford Edge, CRV and RAV4. Edge & RAV4 equal except in price."
"08  3, 2014",Good SUV,"I have owned Toyotas for last 25 years and happy with the performance. With basic maintenance, never had any major problems. New RAV-4 Limited has lots of options that normally I expected in Lexus or luxury car.
Navigation, Backup camera, Blind spot, Lane designation, etc. makes it easy to drive. Ride is not very comfortable as car or van but I expected that being SUV."
"07  9, 2014",Not so pleased,"After driving a 2011 Nissan Rogue, I purchased a RAV4 basically for the looks and Toyota's rep on quality. Trading it in. The seats are hard and uncomfortable and the ride is like a wagon. I can feel every bump! I purchased the XLE and even though it has back up camera, bluetooth, etc, NO electric seats, no sunglass case. I couldve done without the sunroof for electric seats and a better ride!!!"
"06 16, 2014",Realistic Review,"6/16/2014

This is an objective and realistic review from a person who has owned a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD for two weeks and has completed several 300 mile trips. Male, 5'8"", 180 lbs, age 50.

PROS

- Hwy MPG averaging 31.
- Cargo Space is larger than competition.
- Voice activated Bluetooth cellular functionality.
- Voice and Hand activated stereo functionality.
- Seems like a quiet smooth ride.
- Front seat side cushions are comfortable.
- AWD availability.
- Reliable track record.

CONS

- Nowhere to rest elbows during driving. Uncomfortable. Try it.
- Seat is hard an uncomfortable after 2 hours.
- No neck support...There is a monster head support that doesn't adjust well, but why can't mfgrs make a nice neck support!!
- Very very loud rumble/vibration if rear windows are open during driving.
- Can't read air/heat temperature because the mounting plate is tilted toward sunroof reflection.
- New ""sleek"" design is less functional providing less cargo space and access for large items.
- More door height and less window... personal preference to have more window, less door panel.
- Heated seats not available...Come on gang!!!

I believe the 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD is more ""sporty"" than comfortable and is targeted to the younger generation. I believe the focus is to attract this market with a ""sleek"" design and bells and whistles provided thru the monitor screen. Most of the mini SUV mfgrs appear to be copying each other with this new design.

Personally, I prefer to have more cargo space than a ""sleek"" design so I can fit things into my mini SUV. The loveseat I recently purchased won't fit because they tapered off the back end. Otherwise, it would have fit. I would also prefer more seat comfort, elbow rests and neck rest! If you want comfort, make sure you test drive it several times. The Honda CRV seemed more comfortable but had less cargo area. It is a nice looking vehicle and has some bells to play with, but try to look beyond looks and whistles if you also desire functionality and comfort."
"05 30, 2014",Not as good as CRV,"Rav-4 no sunglass holder, front hood has sun glare, does not take bumps and potholes as good as Honda CRV,rear child locks needed. Leased will tolerate for few years."
"05 29, 2014",Toyota rav4 is the best SUV,If you are on the market for a SUV you can not go past the rav4 becomes it is not that expensive to by and it has a grate re-sale value. Also if you are looking for a SUV that can be used for mol table courses such as for off roading or for camping or for local city driving well I recommend this is the perfect car for you.
"05 26, 2014",one of the most reliable cars i have owned,"viewing excellent, dual air conditioning in front, bluetooth hands off to control phone, and radio, power sun roof, new styling front fenders and rear lights. great car probably the last car I will buy!!!"
"05 20, 2014",First brand new car,It is my first brand new car. I feel so relax by driving it. I definitely love my new Toyota Rav4 and I will recommend my friend to buy it.
"05 19, 2014","Happy with Wellesley Toyota, Wellesley MA","I am very happy with TOyota RAV4. It has a beautiful exterior in greay and the interior is also impressive.

What impressed me was the Sales Manager who sold me the car. He was one of the best representatives of any Toyota dealer I've gone to, Martin Hansberry of Wellesley Toyota explained the features of several makes and i am very happy with his suggestions. We negotiated for a price and I was very happy with our final agreement. I had prevously gone to another dealer in Framingham and was very dissatisfied even though I had purchased three other new Toyotas from that same dealer, Their offer was insulting and I will never go back.
Happily Wellesley Toyota makes me a customer for life.."
"05 17, 2014",great car,"After looking at the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester I decided on the Rav 4. I own 4 Camrys for a business and sold an older one last year with 249,000 miles. Toyota reliability speaks for itself. I got the LE with roof rack, mats and mud flaps. Rides nice with wrap around seats. Great gas mileage compared to my trade in 2003 6 cyl. Mazda Tribute. Engine has plenty of power. Sound system is great with Bluetooth and IPOD capability. I removed the rear seat passenger headrest for better visibility when I don't have passengers. But mirrors are positioned well. Looking out the front window over towards the passenger side front area takes some getting use to as the fender is flared upwards. Would recommend this to a friend for sure"
"05 15, 2014",2014 Rav 4 LE......seat comfort,"Regarding the 2014 RAV 4 LE:
Recently test drove it, then purchased it. Does any one else feel a springy band across the seat cushions which bounces into your butt when you drive? This is a really weird feeling! and it's right under your butt! It appears to be in all the seats, but I feel it especially in the front bucket seats.
If I felt it before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
"05  8, 2014",Fabulous!,I absolutely love my brand new Rav 4! I am 62 yrs. old and this is my first brand new car and I feel like a queen! It has everything I need in it and more! It drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage! I would definitedly tell my friends to buy one of these!
"05  5, 2014",Reliability,"Love my Rav 4 so far, especially the flexibility of drive modes. Very important to save on fuel. Will reserve final review after I drive through snow!"
"05  3, 2014",2012 Rav 4,"My 4th Toyota, 1st SUV, 1st preowned car. Absolutely love it! Was nervous about preowned, but it's an excellent car. Of course, it's Toyota!."
"05  3, 2014",good value,"I have owned 7 new Toyota's over the years and am constantly amazed at how they choose the ""standard"" features for each model. They don't seem to make any common sense. For example. My new RAV-4 XLE comes with a standard power sunroof which I might use 2 times as year! I would rather have the 8-way power seat which my wife and I would use every day!
Also the placement of the electric outside driver mirror switch is in a difficult location to operate. I have to look down towards the floor and to the far left, totally away from the road. I have to pull over and stop just to change the angle of the mirror! Also to operate the radio is a nightmare, I have been through the manual but cannot understand how to lock in a new station. What ever happened to just turning a knob and pushing a button? It's crazy!"
"05  1, 2014",Tuff for my gsd,"The only things I don't like
1. No Keyless trunk open (offered on limited, but had to get leather seats to get limited)
2. Got to ""pump"" yah seat up w a lever on side. Not electric.
I"
"04 27, 2014",Hooked on Toyota,"This review is based solely on dealer test drives, therefore my ratings on this RAV4 are limited. However, something may need to be asked about driver visibility on this vehicle. I am over six feet and yet when I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful SUV, I see all hood and no road. Even with a height adjustment, this unfortunate design still exists. I owned a 2003 RAV4 and I remember its selling point to me was the clarity of vision while sitting behind the wheel. Am I the only one reacting this way? My wife and I want to buy this vehicle but this is an issue that troubles us. Any thoughts on this?"
"04 23, 2014",nice car,FOCUS ON THE VEHICL'E FEATURES AND BE SPECIFIC. DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEFORE REVIEWING IT. INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE AND SPECIFIC DEALERSHIP.
"04 19, 2014",thought we liked it not at all,we leased 2013 xle its ok ride is terrible accelerates terrible no power very cheap interior not real happy had it for a year wish we got a camry highlander I think were paying to much for that vehicle to
"04 15, 2014",poor Rav-4,This is the worst SUV that i have ever brought...it has not space and have a really bad 4-wheel drive
"04 13, 2014",Updates on 2014 RAV 4,"Back cargo area has insufficient lighting ( adding ) more of my own. Radio control panel/Navigation impossible to use in certain sunlight, Not just a little. Also, some switches behind and lower of steering are very difficult to use because steering wheel blocks them out. Like the cars. but these three things are very irritating to me,. And I think the 2 year, 25,000 mile warranty would have been a deal breaker if I was thinking more clearly."
"04 12, 2014",Two Weeks from Purchase,"I had a tough time in deciding between the Terrain and the RAV4, but more acceleration (translating safety) and wife's comfort in the seats was the final determinant. Previously owning a '06 Camry also pointed toward reliability. Last weekend we took a round trip of about 400 miles, and I perceived a much stiffer ride than that of the Camry, although it is quite nimble in handling, and quieter. I did notice that on bumpy roads the hood vibrated, especially along the back leading edge. (Perhaps I am too picky.) Investigation revealed just a flexible plastic ""support"" structure under this edge, no steel, so no bolstering pad can be applied under the hood there. This design flaw should be ameliorated.

The transmission shifts well, but the audio controls are a bit confusing for old folks, even though we are computer literate.

Would I buy it again after this two weeks of driving experience? Probably, but its just like getting married - its going to take a while to adjust to the changes, and to really KNOW, although you have committed for life."
"04  9, 2014",Perfect starter SUV,"This is a lux, easy to use and drive ""starter"" SUV. It has a comfortable ride and it feels sturdy and safe. I appreciate that it has an eco and sport mode, and it comes with a lot of upgraded features even in the base LE. My only complaint is the touch screen. I wish it was either angled to the driver or had a small lip or visor over it as when the sun is out it becomes very hard to read."
"04  8, 2014",Smooth Driving Machine,This is a reliable crossover/SUV with a lot of inner space and comfort for front row and back row passengers.
"04  7, 2014",Great vehicle,Very pleased with this RAV 4!!!!!!! Bought the limited after not planning for anything past the XLE. Turned out to be a great decision! Highly recommended!!!!'mm
"03 22, 2014","nice vehicle, but not totally satisfied","This review is on the 2014 Rav4 Limited Edition.
While the exterior and interior are great to look at....I have some reservations on the vehicle regarding majority of the interior.
1. My #1 complaint is about the touchscreen radio. I wear polarized sunglasses (to minimize glare) but when the sun hits the screen...I can't see ANYTHING on the touchscreen radio!! I have to take my glasses off and then I can KIND of see. They should make the touch screen anti-glare or something because even when not wearing my sunglasses, when the sun hits the screen it is VERY difficult to see anything.
2. There are NO INTERIOR LIGHTING in the glove compartment, center console, or cargo area!!!! So, when it's night time and I have to get something from the glove box or center compartment I have to use the lighting from the top by the rear view mirror. And if I have to get anything in the cargo area at night...forget about it!!! I can't see anything, so I have to get out a flashlight or use my cell phone to look around. Granted, I do have black interior but still...at the very least wouldn't you think that there'd be SOME kind of lighting for the cargo area?!
3. There are very few interior compartments and the center console is pretty shallow compared to other vehicles I've had. At the very least, for the limited edition they could have included a compartment for your glasses. I find myself having to stuff everything into one place since there's such limited room. My smaller Honda Civic had wayyy more compartments and little nooks than this bigger size Rav4.
4. I'm sure they added all of the plastic pieces to the vehicle to save $. It would've been nicer without it, but of course it would've been much more expensive.
Aside from all of that...I will say, the vehicle is a beauty to look at. I really like the different things you can do with the radio, change settings to certain things to fit what you want, and I absolutely love the heated seats. The ECO mode and the SPORT mode are interesting...but I honestly don't feel too much of a difference. The vehicle is very smooth to drive and I'm hoping to be keeping it around for another 10+ years!"
"03 20, 2014",Love my Rav4,Just traded in my 2005 Rav4 for a new 2014 one. Love the interior and the comfort. The outside is beautiful. Interior features I did not know was in there. As always it drives so smoothly and effortlessly. Would not of traded in my old Rav4 but the new features on the new one will make my life easier. I never had a problem with the old one and am sure I will experience the same high quality on the new Rav4.
"03 19, 2014",Can't beat a Toyota,"Out of the other cars in this class that I looked at, I like the fact that the RAV4 sits up a bit higher. I also like that the spare wheel is no longer mounted on the hatch door but located inside, I also like that the hatch door rises up, versus opening from left to right. Much easier for loading/unloading to have the door out of the way.

The back seats fold down fairly flat. I don't have to remove the head rests or move the front seats up any.

I wish that Toyota had kept the lock on the glove box, but I guess they have to reduce costs somewhere. The inside styling is a little more functional and looks nice. The rear view camera is a nice addition.

I love the hands-free calling thru the radio. The sound quality is very good. No more tunnel sounds or wind-rushing sounds on the other end. Easy to set up and use. The voice activated calling is great. I was very surprised. I also like that Pandora, when open on my phone, automatically streams thru the radio as soon as I turn on the ignition.

I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but so far it is great.

The only drawback at this point, is the cloth seat has a seam indentation near the seat-back. At first I thought this was a defect in the cushion, but soon discovered that it is the style of the seat. It is kind of strange to get used to at first, but I'm sure eventually I'll forget about it.

The heated air takes about 5 minutes to warm up when the car is cold, and is not super hot, but adequate to stave of the cold. I find in general, that Toyotas take a bit longer to reach a hot air temperature, compared to other brands.

I also find that I have to be careful to shut the door firmly, otherwise the latch catches, but the door isn't shut all the way. Several times I have failed to shut either the hatch or side doors properly and have to open and re-shut them. Only a minor nuisance.

By the way, this review is based on the LE, automatic transmission. I really wanted the heated seats, but did not want to sacrifice the 3inches of head space for the sun-roof. I think it is a great car and will give me many years of satisfaction."
"03 10, 2014",Love my RAV4!,"I purchased a Camry XLE in December 2013. I HATED it. So, after 2 months of driving it I traded it in for a 2014 RAV4 XLE. It was so worth it. I love everything about this car. I love the way it looks, the interior styling and features, the exterior, the technology, the way it drives-it's *exactly* what I wanted in a new vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it. The *one* thing I do wish it had more of is interior compartments/storage nooks-like a coin compartment or a compartment for my sunglasses. That's the only thing it lacks.
I am so glad that I didn't waste any more time with the Camry and got my RAV4.
I couldn't be happier with it!"
"03  8, 2014",Glad I Purchased,"I originally test drove this car based on a friend's recommendation. He has an older model RAV4 and is pleased with it.

I have been driving my new RAV4 for approximately one month, and I am enjoying it! The only reason for 4 stars in the ""Comfort"" category is that I find that when getting into the driver's seat, I have to make sure to be positioned perfectly (for me) or, if driving for an extended period, I begin to get somewhat uncomfortable. I think that this problem will go away as the car and I ""get used to each other"", so not a biggie in the downgrade department.

One review I read (before buying) did not think the car had fast enough acceleration when in the ""eco"", or efficient gas mode. However, I keep it in ""eco"" all the time and have not had any trouble safely accelerating while entering highway traffic. Also, my latest MPG was 26 combined town and highway, with more local than highway driving.

In short....I love this vehicle and think Toyota has done an outstanding design job! I can't think of an item they may have overlooked."
"03  5, 2014",Love my Rav4,"I've had my car for over a month and really love it. The seats are comfortable and everything is within reach when driving. The blue tooth does not work as well as I wish it did, but I bought the car for its reliability and safety. So far I am getting better gas mileage than my 2007 Camry (it was a v6). The drive is smooth and if I want a little more kick, I can change from the eco setting to the sport setting. If I could change anything, I wish the back window was a little larger and that I could get more visibility out of it especially when trying to zip in and out of traffic. Other than that, it's a winner."
"03  5, 2014",My favorite car of all time,"This is my third Rav4. I owned a 2001 and 2005 Rav4 previously. I needed a bigger car in 2008 and the Sienna felt a little small. I purchased a 2008 Chrysler Town & Country. What a mistake that was, I had nothing but problems from the day I purchased it. It is a beautiful car but poorly built. I have NEVER had a problem with my Rav4's so I went back to that. It is the best car ever!!!
Thank you Toyota!
Catherine"
"02 25, 2014",Over & above my expectations!,"My family has always had Fords, but we wanted to try a lease and had seen the good deals on the Toyota Rav 4 - went to Spitzer in Monroeville and dealt with Jim Yoxall - he was excellent! He took the time to explain the lease to us, and answer any questions we had on the car, it was over and above all my expectations! It handles so smoothly, ride is extremely comfortable, has many features and has done wonderful on gas mileage for us. The car has done extremely well in the bad weather we have recently had in PA, and I would highly recommend this car! If anyone is unsure of a Toyota take a trip to Spitzer and ask to talk to Jim and see what a good deal and exceptional vehicle hecan put you in. I will definitely return to Spitzer to deal again when our lease is up."
"02 19, 2014",Great experience,I recently bought a Rav 4 from a salesmen by the name of Shawn. He was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. I had a great experience and I feel like everyone should know.....Go see the boys of Lakewood Toyota!!
"02 14, 2014",Fun and Sassy to Drive,"This vehicle has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Just turned 10K miles. Fun to drive and a wow factor too. I purchased it for local, run around yet overall smaller than the previous Sienna . It fit those profiles. Now, unexpectedly I've had to make to long haul trips (750 mi) each way and guess what? Quiet, smooth, exceptional handling and good gas mileage too. These I did not expect with a small SUV. The ""sport mode"" really gives this little engine some get up and go! Usually drive in the economy mode though. I do wish I had bought the auto rear deck opener. I think a good value with Toyota quality included."
"01 30, 2014",Good Reliable compact SUV for my daughter,Good and nice small compact SUV for daughter. so she can go to college and work.good gas milege and saving money
"01 16, 2014",my 2014 not as good aS OUR 2011,"OUR 2014 DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR 2011

BUT WE DO LIKE THE MISSING OUTSIDE SPARE
THE SEATS COULD USE MORE PADDING
THIS ONE DONT HAVE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS"
"01  7, 2014",Third New Toyota,"Toyota's have always given me excellent service. They are reliable, well- built and affordable.Sales staff highly professional and courteous. Volunteered information and advice that made purchase experience very enjoyable."
"12  5, 2023",rav4 very gud,"Overall, the RAV4 is a great car for commuting, families of four, and space. The RAV4 is the best when it comes to reliability. The RAV4 is very spacious in the second row and the trunk and the car offers comfortable seats. The RAV4 gets okay fuel economy but it does do decent in the snow. However there are some things that it lacks. The RAV4's navigation system is very frustrating to use, just use google maps instead. The RAV4's interior quality is not that great either, there are tons of fake buttons and plastic throughout the interior, but no one who buys a RAV4 cares about the interior. The RAV4 has decent styling, but it is not as stylish as the Mazda CX-5. The RAV4 only has 1 engine option, but does not feel underpowered. The RAV4 also doesn't have a very quiet or comfortable ride. Even though the seats are comfortable, the ride is loud and the inside rattles frequently. If you don't care about luxury and want a practical, reliable car, the RAV4 is perfect."
"07 26, 2023",Very Reliable!!,I absolutely am in love with my Rav! The gas mileage is great! I have owned my Rav for years! I just turned over 100000 miles on it. I have not had any big problems with it at all! They don't make cars like this anymore! My RAV is so very reliable!  It also does super great in the snow as well!
"06 28, 2023",THE BEST NEW CAR EVER PURCHASED BY ME!!!,"Owned a silver 2014 Rav 4 XLS for 9+ years now. The best car I have ever owned to date just required to do regular oil and filter changes 2 brake jobs and routine maintenance. Very good on gas consumption compared to my GMC Envoy, Jeep Grand Cherooke!"
"07 15, 2022",Not recommend for anybody,My stereo system keep showing loading signals and then blackout. It’s completely not working. Called Toyota made a complaint and no solution. Lots people having the same issue. They have to have a recall on that. Worst customer service in Toyota. I will never buy it. I will not recommend Toyota to anybody either
"03  3, 2022",Toyota RAV4 2014,"Best cat I've ever had almost up to 450,000 Kilometres and have had no problems. It's never broke down and the Sports mode is a Beast."
"04  8, 2021",Toyota is for everv and reasonable price,It’s a good car reliable comfort easy to use and drive trustable  smooth spacious three option of speed and low gas consumtion per hundred mile.
"03 31, 2021",Best car I've owned since 1982,This car is simply fabulous in every way!!!!! :)  I feel safe and comfortable and I finally have a radio that works! Could not be happier.
"09 14, 2020",Very fast,I love my car it the ride fit for mi and my family and is good in gas too and very comfortable nice in side
"08 18, 2020",The best car I've owned.,"Toyota RAV4 is a very good compact SUV, and it's easy to see why it's one of the best-selling nameplates in the United States. It delivers impressive fuel economy and comes loaded with plenty of standard features. This Toyota also has an upscale, roomy interior."
"07 19, 2020",Nicest used Cari have ever owned.,This car net all my needs. As a tall-ish guy this car offered a lot of interior room and leg space. It has great gas mileage and handles nicely.
"07 14, 2020",Once I go back  home for good I will buy the same!,"This car was very good for me. I need to sell it Because I'm going back home for good. I will buy the same car for sure!
Money saver.. only 4 cylinder!"
"03  4, 2020",Great value in a sport ute,"Styling, comfort and reliability fully met Toyota expectations.  Fuel economy is a bit less than hoped, but security of 4x4 drive in severe Winter conditions worthwhile.  It’s everything from a grocery getter to regular commuter.  Even gets occasional light duty off-road use on fishing and hunting trips."
"02 27, 2020",Never Letting this one go!!,"I got my 2014 in late 2017 as I was in the process of a divorce and working 2 jobs. Traded in my 2012 Corolla for this. The Vechile is now 6 years old and the suspension and steering still feel like brand new, mine is a base model LE with a Sport and Eco Mode. The Eco Mode on mine I find to limiting, (best if you’re going on a long trip with a low speed limit not during Rush hour at best.) Sport Mode on the other hand is a dream come true driving. The Interior after helping my mom boy her ‘13, my ex-husband buy a ‘15 and my best friend buy a ‘17 does feel a bit on the cheaply made side.  But apart from that it’s wonderful! My Rav has AWD, Traction control, and (thankfully it became standard) a backup camera."
"01 29, 2020",Great vehicle,Great vehicle with lots of room. It is easy to drive and handle. Has lots of room in back for wheelchair or other needed items.
"01 28, 2020",Third RAV4 in the family,"Just purchased a used '11 RAV4 for our daughter to join the '04 and '14 RAV4s already in the family. Great reliability, good gas mileage, compact/easy to maneuver and park, good safety...what's not to like. Because I'm a large guy, slightly bigger seats would be nice, but hardly a show-stopper. Also, I really enjoy all of the additional ""luxury"" items included in my '14 Limited edition, e.g., AWD, blind side monitor, back-up camera, XM radio, heated seats, bluetooth, auto headlights."
"01 21, 2020",2014 RAV radio issues,"My 2014 Rav 4 stereo just went out!!  The bluetooth began to kick on and off a few days ago,  I thought is was issues with my phone."
"01  8, 2020",Meet my expectation in every way,"I owned this car since 2014. The front seat at least for a smaller person (5'6"") is comfy, though an adjustable lumbar support would make the seat better.Engine power is enough to easily get up to speed on most interstate ramps.  Gas mileage is not better than advertised except on long flat runs in the mid 60 mph range, then I get 35mpg or better.  This car has very usable load room. I had many long trips with family and it's best car."
"01  5, 2020","Attractive, functional, reliable, affordable",The perfect car for getting around town comfortably.  Comfortable ride and lots of room inside.  Brand new tires and battery.  Very solid gas mileage and handles great city or highway.
"12 21, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,This car met all my needs. I absolutely love it. It is beautiful on the inside and outside. I am so glad I chose a Rav4.
"11 25, 2019",Good investment for 30k,"This car is reliable, durable, well made for small family or single person. Trunk space is adequate. Features plentiful. The car handles well in highway traffic. Gears change smoothly. Ride is comfortable. One car seat is goid and two would be capacity."
"11 21, 2019",Great all purpose vehicle,"Excellent suspension and road compatibility.  Easy to handle and delivers a smooth, comfortable ride. My wife especially loves the RAV feeling very safe while driving it."
"11  4, 2019",Love the  performance o and reliability of Toyotas,Thi vehicle is not new to us. We just upgraded from a 2009 to a 2014 in the same color etc. We like the reliability.
"10 27, 2019",Excellent Value,This car is very nice and comfortable. For the value you can’t find a better car like RAV4. They are reliable and make a great family vehicle.
"09 27, 2019",Versatile and Reliable,"Full disclosure:  I used to sell Toyota, Buick, Pontiac and GMC cars and trucks.  For my money, Toyota offers extreme reliability at a reasonable cost. My 3014 RAV4 was Toyota Certified with 35,000 miles on the odometer.  Two and a half years later the RAV4 has 90,000 plus miles. The SUV still runs and looks like new. I have done only routine maintenance, replaced original equipment tires with Michelins and replaced the radio with a Kenwood model that featured Apple CarPlay. This RAV4 was as close to a good investment as any car or truck I ever purchased."
"06 10, 2019",5 years never any mechanical issues. Great car!,"I am a big guy. This car is very comfortable to drive with plenty of legroom. Family loves it for long trips to the mountains and beach.  Also plenty of room in the trunk for all my families grocery, toys and if you need even more room like bringing home 20 bags of bark from the garden supply store just make rear seat flat."
"05 20, 2019",It’s Toyota got to be reliable! Enjoying the Ride,"This car meets our needs very reliable comfortable ride ! Great on gas, would recommend same vehicle to friends and family . For a used vehicle and of course a Toyota you know your getting a great car. The 2014 Rav 4 is great and it was a one owner car well taken car of we are now a Toyota family along with my Tundra. Looking to purchase another Tundra or Tacoma soon and passing my used Tundra down to my son."
"04 13, 2019",best car i vere owned,this car meets our need good leg room good gas mileage lots of power rear seats lay down for extra cargo space sun roof towing package if you need it
"04  8, 2019",Very nice vehicle I love it,This vehicle was just what I was looking for. I have owned Volvo’s  this vehicle is just as nice and very easy to drive  love it
"03 27, 2019",Great vehicle,"Plenty of room, easy to get in and out of.  Seats are comfortable.  Love the back up camera, the Bluetooth feature easy to handle and good on gas"
"02  9, 2019",Things gone bad,Radio quit working after warranty expired.  Car was less than 3 years old.  Toyota is not standing by their product and won't replace it even though this is a common problem.  Now transmission fluid is leaking.  Car is a lemon!
"01 30, 2019",Pontiac vibe,You cannot go wrong with the Toyota engine very dependable good on gas all wheel drive is the way to go with the 1.8 engine
"01  9, 2019",I like RAV4 limited owsam. Car I like everything,Really good family car  it has all the features that we need to make our life luxury  plus previous owner installed Remot Startar  i recommend everyone one to buy limited rav4
"01  2, 2019",Toyota reliability is nearly unmatched,"I purchased this vehicle to be my personal take me to the mountains, rivers, golf course, etc.  It has been totally reliable and given good comfort doing it.  On long trips I get better than advertised gas mileage."
"12 23, 2018",Disappointing!,"Too many issues...been serviced only at  Griffin ...radio/stereo quit working and all door locks do not work!!  Only 41,000 miles!!!!  Very dissatisfied and disappointed in problems and cost to tepair issues that should have not even been an issue with such a new car!!!"
"12  5, 2018",Lots of road noise,When we drove it a little sluggish when asked to get up to freeway speed and enough road noise anyone in the back seat couldn't hear.
"11 27, 2018",coolest most reliable car I have owned !!!,I needed a car that was AWD and simple - this rides on the snow like a snow mobile especially if you add snow tires...gas mileage is great and style is perfect for me !!! I love em' so much I bought a second !!!
"11  4, 2018",Most best value car i ever owned,This car exhibited all my needs. One of the best value price car. Design is really great. Very comfortable car. Most successful car from Toyota for the reasonable price
"10 15, 2018",reliable and lots of room,"This vehicle has definitely met my needs being roomy, all wheel drive and I am able to use the racks on top for transporting my kayaks  and by the way, I love the color."
"10  2, 2018",Can't compare to any other small SUV,"We looked for several other cars before getting this RAV4. We compared to a Mazda CX-5, Subaru Forester, and Honda CRX. But none of those cars compares to our Toyota. We love how smooth it is to drive, how fuel efficient it is, the cargo space has no comparison and even though we own an LE (lowest trim), the interior is very comfortable, and it has almost every accommodation that the competitors' mid trims have (except the automatic lights)"
"08  8, 2018",A nice and reliable car to own,It is really good for me with all my needs. I will buy the newest model to have the best and latest accessories every one is longing for.
"07 18, 2018",Zippy dependable commuter and traveling vehicle.,Owned the car for four years.  I love how it handles and quickly accelerates.  The ride could be smoother and quieter.  I never had to take it to the shop for anything other than maintenance.
"06 27, 2018","Easy to buy, own, resell","On second RAV4. Great mileage for an SUV non-hybrid. Excellent acceleration in Economy mode, never mind Sport. Roomy enough for four adults . Lots of storage."
"06 23, 2018",We are a Toyota Family,This was an easy choice.  Toyota is a great brand and we know we can always count on the car!!  Thanks for being there for the family.
"06 22, 2018",Versatility is the best of all cars owned.,"This car has usability that prior cars could never equal, with the rear seats being able to push all the way down flat. This allows extending the cargo area enough to carry items most cars would not be able to. Yet, it's smaller in length, so it fits nicely into smaller spaces."
"06  4, 2018",Most comfortable Automobile I have owned.,"I found myself in need of a vehicle that will perform well in snow due to job location change.
The Rav4 has exceeding my expectations for comfort and has performed very well in snow.
My job is at one of the higher elevations and at the top of the hill...I see many vehicles sliding
when it snows and I have had no problem at all."
"05 30, 2018",Disappointed but I don?t hate the car,I wish I shopped around more and looked and more cars in the same class. It took me a little while and I started to find this this car really lacked!
"05 26, 2018",Most reliable car ever,This car makes me drive like a boss as I just stated my own business I would like to have this rav4 do that I can never worry about breakdowns
"05 24, 2018",Great suv,The RAV4 is a great suv. I bought it because I needed a bigger car than my Camry when I got a dog and bought a house. The 75lb pup has room and I have room for transporting yard clean up to the dump. Because of my raves about this car 2 of my friends are now happy RAV4 owners.
"05 19, 2018",Love my Rav4,"Great cargo space. Love the backup camera, steering wheel controls for audio and bluetooth. Deep cup holders so bottles won't rattle around and plenty of storage for all the things I keep in the car. Bought it at a great dealership - A1 Toyota in New Haven CT. Wouldn't shop anywhere else."
"05 16, 2018",Best car i have ever driven.,This car is reliable and comfortable to drive. It holds its value and feels very safe driving in the winter weather. Only car I will ever own.
"05  3, 2018",I have always wanted to own one.,"Overall I am pleased. Improvements could be made on quality of interior. A storage compartment on the dash for a cell phone or transponder. Also, better floor mats."
"04 21, 2018",I got exactly what I was told i will be getting.,The vehicle was in excellent condition and the price was also less than average market value. Due to the low price i did not even had to bargain
"03 30, 2018",Love my RAV,"My sister recommended the RAV and I really like mine.  I've driven it almost 100,000 km since 2015 and would definitely buy another one.  Gas mileage is great with my 4 cylinder engine.  No blind spots when you change lanes compared to my Ford Escape.  Never had one issue with it in the 3 years I've owned it."
"03 21, 2018",We're on our 2nd Rav4 and most likely to #3?,The Rav4 is the perfect vehicle for us. There's plenty room for whatever you do. The rear seats fold down for even more cargo space. Dependability is just another reason we love our Toyota.
"03 20, 2018","I love Toyota, and I especially love my 2014 Rav4","The Rav4 is well priced for its comfort, options and performance.  It drives and handles like a much more expensive vehicle, is super dependable and a very comfortable ride."
"03  7, 2018",Review of 2014 Toyota RAV4,"Would prefer armrests for long driving.  - Hoped I would get 30 mpg on long trips. Am near but not quite able to accomplish that yet. - Very comfortable for long periods in car.  Car suspension system especially comfortable.  - Have added a hitch, crossbars for roof rack, fog lights to increase usefulness of this car.  Wish seats would fold forward completely to leave a flat surface in the back of the car.  As it is there is a slight incline where the seats fall forward. -  All driving apparatus near at hand and their use is not difficult to grasp for the first-time driver.  Wish car's odometer would always show (it doesn't) when looking for other available readings such as current mpg, average mpg, Trip A, Trip B, etc.  - Am a hard marker so I think the 4 stars I have given is a very high rating for the car.    5 Stars might have been given but for the exceptions mentioned above."
"03  1, 2018",Adore my Rav 4,"Perfect size, great features, drives like a dream and is very comfortable. So glad I found this vehicle. It?s perfect! Even used its rock solid."
"02 27, 2018",Very smooth ride.,"I have only owned this vehicle for a few weeks but so far I love it. It rides smooth and has a sleek design.
If I were to have recommended an improvement it would be to improve the quality of the interior."
"02 13, 2018",Beautiful Car,I love this car. It is so nice inside and out. I bought it used and it has held up its value vary nicely. I would buy it again.
"02  7, 2018",Not the most reliable,"I've driven this car for three years now, we are at 85,000 km and the transmission is now failing. Any one having the same problem?"
"02  2, 2018",I love my RAV4,RAV4 is a great car for travel and to cruise around town. It is spacious and comfortable and I am enjoying every bit of it.
"01 31, 2018",I love RAV-4 Toyota,"It is confortable, cute, economic. And is perfect for women like me. It is not expensive and  I can fell sure driving far away or I. Express way for it estabity."
"01 29, 2018",Multi functional car.,The rav is zippy around town and gets 22 mpg as rated.  The all wheel drive works great in the snow.  I can haul a six foot step ladder with the rear seats down.  Tall adults can ride comfortably in the back seat.  I have gotten 31mpg on the highway.
"01 17, 2018",Very reliable car.,"I very seldom drive it, my wife drives the majority of the time. The size of the vehicle is much easier for to drive. Previously owned a GMC Acadia she didn't like the vehicle to big."
"01  9, 2018",Best Car Ever!!!,I had wanted a Rav 4 for a long time and now that I have one I am not disappointed!  This car handles the road well under any conditions.  I am very happy with the 29 mpg it gets.  It is very comfortable for long distance trips  both front and back with lots of leg room.  It has a spacious cargo area that I use constantly.  The interior feels very luxurious especially with all the features that came on this model.  When it is time for a new vehicle I will definitely get another Toyota Rav 4!
"12 30, 2017",LOVE my RAV 4's!!!,"Just upgraded to this vehicle....I've owned 2 others and never looked back! Excellent performance & handling, roomy, comfortable and safe for my 16 year old daughter to drive!!"
"12 28, 2017",this rav 4 has nore room inside than you think,"the rav4 is great on gas for being a awd car it has comfortable room for someone who is 6'5  and i have alot of leg room and for people in the back seats it has alot of room as well ,and when you put the seats down you haul a good amount of things as well"
"12 11, 2017",Great Car,This car met my needs.  It has plenty of leg room in the front and the back.  It rides nice and goes great in the snow.  I'm really enjoying the car.
"12  1, 2017",Love this car!,We purchased this car in October and it is great. It was a great value relative to other comparable? vehicles and we love it.
"11 29, 2017",RAV4 owner,"I purchased this car almost a year ago, after having an older model RAV4.  I love love love this car."
"11 11, 2017",the most reliable car i have owned is the one i'm,i like it because it's good on gas. it's comfortable all the way around. we go on long rides now and i don't have to get out half way threw the trip.
"11 10, 2017",AMAZING,Just bought one it is gorgeous. Cannot wait to drive my new car!!!!! The sunroof is an awesome buying feature!
"11 10, 2017",Great relialablity,Great driving enjoy the heated seats and sun roof. Electric rear hatch is easy to use and very useful.
"11 10, 2017",2012 and older were built much better,Car is just okay very disappointed after owning a 2012 rave 4 quality was sacrificed for cheaper plastics to get more fuel mileage
"11  2, 2017",My first smaller car,It met all my needs. I got good gas mileage with it. I had no problems and service was great. They did all the paper work when I bought the car.
"11  2, 2017","I leased this car new, liked it so  I bought it.","Easy to drive, easy to park. Service was great. the only problem I had was when I bought it at the end of my lease I had to wait about 5 weeks to get my title to register the after I had paid for it in full"
"10 24, 2017",Relability+,Great highway vehicle. Great fuel economy coupled with plenty of engine power. Enough goodies to make the vehicle enjoyable.
"10 22, 2017",Love my Rav4,"We love this car.  Runs great, good gas mileage and dependable.  Lots of room.  Love the back seat laying down so we can carry things.  Would recommend."
"10 21, 2017",my first car,The car met all of my needs.  It is very comfortable for me. I am driving every day to my work and bask.
"10 21, 2017",Love my RAV4!',"This car is better than I expected! Meets all my needs and is a pleasure to drive. Highly recommended to family and friends. Dealership New Country Toyota, Westport CT, and especially Nick (sales) and Jessica (service)"
"10 11, 2017",Most reliable SUV on the market.,Most reliable SUV on the market!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"09 16, 2017",Great AWD small SUV,"We wanted an AWD, small SUV with decent gas mileage and great reliability. This car checks all the boxes! We owned a Subaru Forrester in the past; it was good but not quite as reliable."
"09 10, 2017",Best alround car on the market,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)"
"09  6, 2017",Love all the safety options,I love the way this vehicle handles. It is very cost efficient with great fuel mileage. Love the roominess in the inside for a small SUV.
"09  6, 2017","RAV4 Limited -AWD, xtra security features, loaded!",Excellent reliable and top model car with technology package included.  Hard to find Limited models with the technology package and blizzard pearl exterior with two tone interior: black/cinnamon.
"09  3, 2017",Great small SUV,"Love this car, plenty of room, power when needed and good on fuel. I've owned several Toyota's and I like this one the most."
"08 29, 2017",So far so good,"I haven't owned the car long, but it has been a good car so far. I would recommend it to people looking for a good midsize vehicle."
"08 29, 2017",Really good suv,I think that's one of the best and most reliable car I've ever owned. I really like it. Never had any issues with it.
"08 22, 2017",Couldn't be happier with my choice,"This car fits all of my needs. The back seat offers great leg room suitable for my in-laws who are over 6ft tall. The dual-zone climate control is a great feature that is included in the XLE. Backup cameras come standard and are super helpful for safety and parallel parking. I feel so safe in this vehicle and have no worries when my wife drives to work. The seats can wear you down a little bit on road trips over 3 hours long. However, once you find the way you like the seat you won't have a problem; it took me one trip to figure out just how to adjust the seat to make it fit my needs perfectly. You won't regret buying this vehicle. Another plus is that you can get fuel economy of 30+ mpg on highway driving!"
"08 10, 2017",Rideshare customers love this vehicle,"As a senior citizen, this  vehicle and all the items I was looking for in a new car including  rear camera, side mirror turn signal's, plenty of cupholders, fog lamps.  Unfortunately, hybrid technology was not available in the RAV 4 in 2014.  Rideshare customers love the roominess and comfort of the vehicle, and so do I."
"08  7, 2017",I love this car!!!!!,This was the best car for me. I'm so happy I used the service to find the most ideal vehicle for me. I found everything I wanted in the car. Thank you thank you thank you!!!
"08  7, 2017",RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION,"YOU CANT BEAT A TOYOTA FOR ALL AROUND QUALITY AND SAFETY.  I ONLY FILLED UP THE GAS TANK EVERY TWO WEEKS, AND I DROVE AROUND A LOT."
"08  5, 2017",Love my Rav4,"I just purchased my Rav4 this week.  So far I couldn't ask for a better vehicle.  It is roomy, comfortable, smooth riding and just all around perfect for me."
"08  4, 2017",Love my Rav4!!,"I've just had it a few days, but I love it!!  I have been wanting one for a long time.  It has exceeded my expectations!!  Can't wait to travel with it."
"08  3, 2017","Spacious, sporty and fun","We test drove three different cars before landing on our RAV4. We chose it because of the options of Eco Mode and Sport Mode for driving, the AWD capabilities, the absolute comfort both front and back, the look, the interior, and of course the Toyota brand! So happy to have a Toyota back in my life!"
"08  3, 2017",Sound system computer died,I am very disappointed.  I had my car less than 5 months and the radio system went out and I was told I would have to pay 800 for a new one.
"08  3, 2017",Go For The Limited,"Love the drivability of the RAV4. Once I found one with a black exterior & then experienced the interior of a Limited trim level, it was all over. I knew I had found the perfect car for me."
"07 31, 2017",Most Stylish Car I've Owned,"I have driven RAV4s before, but never one this stylish. The interior has 2-tone softex leather-trimmed seats that are not only the most comfortable I've ever sat in, but also a thing of beauty!!! It handles incredibly well and, even though it is 3 years old, it looks and handles like a brand new car. Toyota's are the best!"
"07 28, 2017",Very fun to drice,"Only had it for a few weeks, but so far I love it. It drives very well and has been very reliable so far. I really like the interior design"
"07 28, 2017",Sit back and enjoy the ride,Great features on the interior. Loved the power seats that were also heated seats. 2nd row seat that reclines. Perfect size for everyday commute.
"07 24, 2017",Best car to upgrade to!,"This car is the ultimate vehicle - lots of space/leg room, great mpg for an SUV, just overall the best car I've ever owned! Highly recommend the RAV4 to anyone looking for a new car, you will not be disappointed!"
"07 23, 2017",Has power,This vehicle has power and keeps it's value. It is a Toyota by the way.  Lots of cup holders!   Very cute Suv and very reliable
"07 13, 2017",It's a Toyota!,"This is my second RAV4 and fifth Toyota overall. First RAV4 (2009) I put over 120K on it with only routine maintenance and two sets of tires. Traded for a Subaru Impreza hatchback but was not happy with it (to small). Traded Subaru for 2014 RAV4 love the looks and the size very happy, I will never own anything but Toyota! Keep up routine maintenance and Toyota will last forever."
"07  2, 2017","New owner, a leased vehicle 2 years old. Used.",",Still getting used to it, my immediate negatives were lack of storage spaces around the cabin and arm resting places while driving.  Visually there are more blind spots than I am used to, but I say that is more my adjustment than the car.  Road noise is sort of  loud, but I hit a different patch of concrete and total silence.  Is it tires or something else?  I don't have a complaint about zippy, cuz the car will adjust to your desire. I had a Montero Sport 6 cyl with the same HP and had to drive  1200 Lbs more. Positives.  I like the Blue tooth,  radio controls on the steering column.  The fuel consumption meters, backup camera, and the SPACE OVERALL. One other thing is the dash trim has a reflective surface with the sun, sort of a chrome shine."
"06 23, 2017",Love it,"The Rav4 drives smoothly, is very comfortable and has awesome features. I would highly recommend it."
"06 15, 2017",my little dream suv,"Love the whole pkg...from color to size, comfort, gas mileage. sporty looking . The Interior being black and brown called Terracotta sealed my love for it."
"06 12, 2017",Great Reliable SUV at a great price,"I'm a tall fellow at 6'4"" and the Rav4 LE fits me just fine. The right console is designed just right so my knee can rest comfortably. The Safety features are great, as is the gas mileage for an SUV. The only cons that I've found so far is there is some road noise over rough surfaces and the lack of android auto/ability to show google maps on the LED screen for navigation."
"06  3, 2017",Nice interior and exterior plus reliable,I really like  toyota Rav4. It is nice exterior and nice interior even though some are disappoint me.
"05 31, 2017",Toyotas most reliable the only cars i buy,I love my RAV4 XLE  I am comfortable and its just the right size. I wish it had GPS and an alert signal for when I am going to change lanes.
"05 31, 2017",Very reliable stylish car,Very reliable stylish car. Excellent coverage under Toyota care. The car is very comfortable and spacious and suitable for road trips as it is good on mileage.
"05 30, 2017",2013 RAV4 XLE,"The RAV4 XLE is a great value for the money. Looking for a smaller SUV, this is it.  2013 and newer has so many more options, from Bluetooth to a backup camera."
"05 23, 2017",comfortable and sleek looking,"So far, love this car.
 Cars.com had a great variety in my area. Response was immediate.Dealer was informative and helpful. Made the purchase easy."
"05 23, 2017",Great styling and reliability,Reliable vehicle with spacious and well laid out interior. Good gas mileage. Put a hitch on it and planning to tow a small boat and installed bike rack.  Great family car.
"05 21, 2017",So far so good,Just what my wife needed! Easy to get in and out of! Plenty of room for grandkids and gardening hobby.....
"05 17, 2017",I am loving my choice!,"I was able to test drive three vehicles and purchased the Toyota Rav4 XLE! Love this vehicle! It handles well, very comfortable, nice interior and great on gas.  The navigation and bluetooth ability is definitely a plus! The ECO or Sport mode option when driving is excellent! One of my better decisions in purchasing a vehicle."
"05  3, 2017",Great car for the money,"I've only had this car for a little bit but so far it's been great.  Great on gas for a crossover SUV, looks sharp, handles well and has that Toyota reliability!  A lot more spacious than it looks from the outside.  The AWD will be handy once winter hits again in here in the midwest.  It is a quiet ride also!  Great little car all around.  So far so good."
"04 24, 2017",Somewhat disappointed,"I leased a standard model RAV4 three years ago, and when deciding whether to take the car I was bothered by dumb changes they have made to the interior, plus I wasn't thrilled with the exterior design either. And today I feel the same way. For instance, they moved the cup holders so that one is under the dash making it hard to get out. There is no longer a tray in the mid-seat compartment. There is still a compartment over the glove box, but they omitted the door that would go over it. There is no light over the front cup holder and adjacent areas. To turn on the overhead lights you have to feel around for a switch instead of just tapping on the light as before. Etc. All pretty annoying if you've owned an earlier RAV4. Door keys on the earlier model design you could easily feel the buttons, whereas the new style you cannot. I'm not crazy about the lift-up rear door, but that's just me. These things still annoy me after three years of having the car, so much so that I'm thinking of trading down to an earlier model. Performance is good, including the new transmission. It's still a good vehicle, I just think they made some real mistakes in the design. I would have given the car higher reliability rating if I had not had to do a near-complete brake job a few days ago."
"04 22, 2017",Navigation screen,I own a 2014 rav4 limitted. After 2 years of using the nav screen keeps on rebooting. When i went to toyota to have it fix but the cust service said that they cant fix the screen because it is not a toyota product I was so disappointed. My vehicle is out of warranty and im willing to pay for repair.  I will never go for toyota again.
"04 11, 2017",Most Reliable Car I've Owned,me and my family  love this car because Toyota is great. Thats why we love the rav4. It is really good for children
"04  1, 2017",Decent car,I had this car for three years. The road noise was loud but it drove really well in the snow!  Overall it was a good car but my family needed something bigger
"03 24, 2017","Excellent aerodinamic, economic in gas","Good I recommend it. If you can afford a hybrid, get it. very good in gas, excellent in sport mode if you wanna get away fast. The entertainment system is not good, cheap, a pain to upgrade, and only navigation in full loaded."
"03 10, 2017",RAV4 Limited,"I love this vehicle though I am open-minded. I am on the lookout for a similar/different vehicle that is very reliable, comfortable and has economical gas consumption."
"03  7, 2017",I had a RAV4 for 10 years. I love this one too,I had a 2006 RAV4 and then went to a Camry for the last year and a half. It was so low to the ground and just wasn't me. I love the room and comfort of the RAV4
"02 10, 2017",Toyota Rav 4 2014,Bought my rav 4 brand new in 2014 jan.1 year later i noticed colour change in my moulding looking like burnt patches.Filled a claim with Toyota which they declined to replace and told me i will have to pay for it.Now we are in 2017 the patches have continue to increase.Six months ago my radio just stopped working again i went to Toyota and reported all they said was i need to replace a new radio.It keeps reloading then goes off again and again.I have noticed this is a common problem with toyota.I am a very dissatisfied and disappointed customer.Am still paying for car.
"01  9, 2017",Radio Issues,My radio recently went out on my Toyota Rav 4. I haven't even owned  the vehicle for three years. I am over on miles so the warranty is void. The dealership wants 1200 dollars to replace my existing radio with a refurbished radio. I have checked the internet and this seems to be a defect with the system.
"12 19, 2016",2014 Red Toyota Rav4 LE,I bought my Toyota Rav4 as a certified Pre-Owned and it never disappointed me. The car is very smooth and definitely recommend to others.
"10 23, 2016",It's not a Porsche,"Awesome car for the money. If you are looking for top of the line quality leather, and you can't live without another cup holder, buy a Lexus. If you need speed,  buy a Porsche.  If you want style, and want to look like you know what you're spong, buy this Rav 4. And stop borrowing your grandmother's Buick!"
"09  1, 2016",Radio/Bluetooth,Have had my 2014 Toyota RAV 4 into the dealership 3 times with radio/bluetooth problems and it is still not fixed. The first time the radio was stuck on a station and I could not control volumn. Took it to dealership and they said it was a computer upgrade. Picked up the car and then the blue tooth was not working and constantly flashes connect/disconnect they said they fixed it again. Picked it up and still not working so took it back to dealer and they say they will replace the entire radio. Get it back with the new radio and still not working. Now they will not call me back to get it in again and it will be a week tomorrow since I picked it up and called them on 8/27/2016 saying it is still not working. Besides this problem they sold me a clear coat on the paint and scotch guard for inside and it seems like the paint chips even worse than any other car I've ever owned. The ride is not smooth and feels like you're in a truck when you go over bumps. I bought the car new in 2014 but I probably won't be hanging onto it for much longer.
"01  2, 2016",Rav4 a good bet,"I was shopping at end of year for 2013-2014 AWD vehicle with hatchback. I test drove the Subaru Outback , Toyota Rav4 Limited, Ford Escape SE and Titanius and Honda CRV touring. For the money and features the Toyota was the best buy. I will say the Honda was the smoothest ride and the Ford had the best engine performance. The Toyota was in-between these two for performance and comfort. The sport mode did give it better performance and the eco mode is nice for basic driving. Subaru Outback was not as good driving and I was surprised. Looking at the XLE and Limited in my view the Limited is worth it (~2-3K more on the used model). The limited has better seats and comfort. Also just more stand items included. Some have complained on the Bluetooth system. It works with my iphone 5 just fine and the dealer showed me a few tricks. The nav system is not the greatest, but not a big deal for me. since I like to use my phone anyway (included with limited so I have it). The interior lighting is a bit for for the switches but not a show stopper.

Things I really liked were visibility, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, drivers seat adjustments., AWD, handling and overall power."
"10  8, 2015",i hate this piece,I rented this car and I was NOT impressed. Everyone was saying the same thing.. S it has backseat recliners wow.. I would buy the Ford Escape or the X Trail or the CRV or something else I can't believe I rented this... I hate Toyota cars because they are extremely boring and timeless...Their parts are expensive and the don't last as long as you think
"09 30, 2015",2014 rav 4,Never enjoyed a day with my 2014 rav 4. So regretted buying it. The ride is the worst I have ever experienced causing my central nervous system to take a hit. Toyota says thats how they are built.
"09 25, 2015","Great vehicle, overall","I own a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD. Pros: Stable, comfortable ride with a relatively smooth and well-behaved 6-speed automatic transmission. Back-up camera is fantastic. Rear leg room is massive, especially compared to a sedan of equal length. The rear seats recline, which is great. The heated seats are phenomenal. The AWD system, brakes, and traction control make this vehicle feel extremely steady in poor, wintery conditions. It surprised me how well it all works. Cons: Cheap plastic around shifter lever. Rear styling is weird. The tail lights are odd-looking, and the button to release the rear hatch is far too high. Engine is very weak. I would have bought a V6 if it were still available. Overall, it's a great little SUV. It has a good balance of utility, size, and car-like handling. Just don't buy this vehicle if you're looking for something exciting to drive. It's not for people who value performance."
"09 16, 2015",Overated but Good Space and MPG,"Pros:
Nice Cargo Space for Mini SUV.
Good MPG.
Fairly quiet ride.

Cons:
Blind Spots due to High Metal doors and tailgate. Very Loud Interior Rumble when back windows are open. Uncomfortable seat after one hour of driving. Lack of true recreation assistance features. Lightweight aluminum doors dent very easily. Tailpipe and muffler hang down like they forgot to plan for it. No way to tie down tailgate when transporting large items with tailgate open. No way to shut off annoying beeper when tailgate is open. Tiny tiny arm rest storage box. Integrated voice calling and stereo need improvement.

Summary
A bit disappointed. I would not purchase a RAV4 again."
"08 31, 2015",terrible interioal finish,Just want to let every one knows rav4 has terrible and unacceptable defects in the interioal finish. to look at the joint between windshield and top and you can see how rough the job they have done.that is really unacceptable!!!!!!! looks just like junk !!! not understand why they made rav4 like this. I checked other cars there is no one make this joint like rav4
"08 17, 2015",Excellant car,"Lots of Space, great gas mileage, dependable, good dealer network. The wind noise very noticeable at freeway speeds specially when going over 75mph. But good outward visibility, smooth breaking, and powertrain is smooth and efficient"
"07  1, 2015",Unrepairable Air conditioner (AC),"Car is beautiful over all,
but it has stinky Air conditioner. And Toyota refuse to fix it under warranty. IT costs about 160$ every 3-4 months to have it deodorizer and change cabin filter."
"04  7, 2015",rav 4 negatives,"I purchased a 2014 rav4 on Nov 3, 2014. The xle model is great looking but not knowing the rating on the vehicle I did purchase the full 5yr 100,000 extra warraty. Now for the negatives as follows:
1. The speed indicator is off a solid two miles an hour and I hope I don't get a speeding ticket.
2. Too much glare on the screen in middle of dash.
3. This one makes me balistic - The bluetooth system really sucks, sucks, and sucks some more. I had it to the dealer and he said my problem is the brand of phone I have-bull ! I have a 2013 Chevy Silverado and the phone works the was it should on the bluetooth system so it's not my phone. This is how bad it is - When I receive a call after around two minutes the connectivety is lost and will not return until I pull off the road and shut the car off and wait two minutes and restart the car and then it returns. I don't care what brand of car from the most costly to the least that's just plain discusting. I was looking at a Chevy Equinox and only if I would have know I would be driving one. I will never buy another new car without test driving the bluetooth.
4. The dealer has the unliest dealer stickers ever that they put on the car and I just had to remove it."
"02 20, 2015",Lynch Toyota Manchester Ct,"I recently bought a 2014 Rav 4 LTD,
on the day I was picking up my Rav 4, Eduardo explained in great detail how to use Auto High Beam, Lane Departure Alert, Blind Spot Monitor and plus Entune Premium JBL Audio with Navigation Multimedia App Suite, and connecting my I Phone including my address book and music.
Yesterday had a problem with my music not connected, called and Eduardo was on a trip to New York, he called later in the afternoon, set up appointment in the evening and this problem was corrected in 5 minuets.
Lynch Toyota is very lucky to have this terrific person on
their team."
"01 11, 2015",Overall Pleased,"We rented this vehicle for a trip from Florida to California and back. We spent 3 weeks and 5800 miles in it. Two adults and probably 400 lbs of cargo. I found the gas mileage around home (35-55 mph with few lights) was around 34 mpg. On the road at 75 mph we got 27ish mpg on 10% ethanol and 28+ on pure gas. At 70 mph it gave 28.5ish on ethanol and 30-31 on real gas and at 65 it was 29 on ethanol and 32-33 on pure gas. Around L.A. (the city of cars & traffic) we averaged 24.5. Overall we got 28+ mpg. for the trip. 28 heading west and 28.5 going east. I found the wind affected the mileage greatly. For 2 adults it was fine. Rode comfortably. When the adult kids were with us we found issues with the back seat belts not wanting to release. The cup holders in the back are not very user friendly either. For my wife and I, I would consider buying one of these. If we had younger kids I would still consider it. For a family with teens, I'm not so sure. One thing I found I did not like but I got used to was the hood flexed and bounced around. I thought it wasn't latched tight, but it was."
"01  1, 2015",Love this SUV,"We really love this car and it's a Toyota. I worked at a GM dealer for 40 years as a mechanic so do know my cars. Previously owned a 2004 Pontiac Vibe which really was a Toyota Matrix with Pontiac badges. It was a fantastic car with no problems in 135,000 miles. Bad move GM as we loved the Vibe so much that when it came time to replace the Vibe GM had quit making them. We would have purchased a Matrix but Toyota quit making them also. Bad move Toyota. Had made up our minds to purchase a Subaru Outback but having seen way too many bad reviews on them using oil. Took a Rav4 for a test drive and loved it. Live in Montana and the AWD is amazing for getting around on the snow/icy roads. It gives almost too much confidence on how well it handles horrible roads. Was going tonight put snow tires on but it would have been wasted moneys because it goes anywhere with the factory highway tires. I could nitpick but all the great features make up for everything."
"12 20, 2014",Poor Cabin Design,"We are leasing a Rav 4. As with most cars you have to live with it a while to see short comings. The interior has many flaws, poor location for many switches which cannot be accessed without contortions. Very poor interior lighting, especially in the rear. The bottom of the doors collect mud and snow leaving your clothes a mess as well as the garage floor. No illumination for controls located on the door. The heated seats are not as effective as others I have owned. The gas tank is too small. The radio operation requires a Masters from MIT, hundreds of pages to the manual! I am glad I am leasing and not owning."
"10 23, 2014",My other Toyota experience is promising.,"This is a very good car for the money. Seems to be more economical than advertised. Practically noiseless, and well controllable."
"10 11, 2014",Navigation Blues,"I found the navigation screen almost impossible to use due to the glare. I have overcome this by using a $200. Garmin Nuvi, and stuck the suction onto a hockey puck then dropped the whole thing into the front cup holder. The power outlet is right there and the screen can be tilted toward the driver and is crystal clear regardless of bright sunlight. The puck fits snugly into the cup holder which is a convenient coincidence. As far as reading radio stations and other data, well that is still a problem for me, anyone got an idea?"
"10 10, 2014",Rav4 Ride!,Purchased 2014 Rav4 after comparing with other famous sports utility and been driving it for about 2 months now. Cabin is noisy and ride is bumpy!
"09 29, 2014",First time Toyota user,"this is the first time I have purchased a Toyota personally. I have had friends with them, but for me I have not owned one. So far, with the one month of use, I like the vehicle. I am a bit disappointed in the engine size but with time I hope to get use to it. On the highway it takes a bit to get the car moving..."
"09 23, 2014",Still learning,"Have owned the Rav4 for a month. We are very pleased with it so far. Ride and comfort are excellent. We are still learning what the car can do. The manual for electronics package alone is 200 pages. One small complaint, display screen is nearly flush with dash board and sometimes unreadable in bright sunlight."
"09 23, 2014",Nicest Car I have Ever Owned,"After reviewing rating online and consumer reports, I decided to see a Toyota Rav4 at the dealership. My husband and I found this vehicle to be everything we both were looking for in a sporty vehicle. Being that we like to do outdoor activities, Sunday drives, traveling, this vehicle provides everything we were looking for in a car. We purchase the XLE model that included the navigation. It has the sun roof, gps and other applications such as weather and traffic. It also has fog lights and many other features to make our trips enjoyable. We are very pleased with out purchase."
"09 18, 2014",bad MPG,"Dad MPG, this is my toyota, and i getting bad MPG 21 city; 26 hwy. love the radio and phone setup. at 4,000 miles. no problem."
"09 12, 2014",love my rav4,"It's really too early to give an impression of the things on the list, we just bought it yesterdqy. BUT, it was a replacement for a 2012 Rav 4 which was totaled in a MVA. Our 2012 was very reliable. Never had a bit of trouble with it. . I love Toyota!!"
"09  8, 2014",Make sure you're comfortable in the RAV4,"I've driven the RAV4 for about 1000 miles an overall I'm very happy, you as a prospective Rav 4 buyer compare the XLE and Limited for seat comfort. I find the armrest moves back-and-forth ""adjustable"" and sometimes is annoying and blocks the drink holder. Also a couple of the controls are in-conveniently placed above your left knee while sitting in the driver seat. I purchased the limited because I wanted blizzard pearl paint and I am very happy that I did I'm happy with all at this point after driving the thousand miles the liftgate is very convienient The pushbutton start is wonderful and the doorhandles lock and unlock is a very convenient feature. I would highly recommend the RAV4 for mileage and controls and drivability and I would recommend it to a friend"
"09  5, 2014",Good and bad.,"I just got a new 2014 RAV 4 Limited edition last month. I previously drove 2008 RAV 4 for 4 years and a 2012 Rave 4 XLE for 2 years. They are very reliable SUVs.

2014 RAV 4 Pro:
- Very reliable to drive during all season
- Easier to maneuver, turn and drive
- It has slightly better shock absorption capacity from uneven road than the previous models.
- Good mirrors that provide wider and better view of the road.
- Limited edition comes with lots of features, like back up camera, seat warmer etc.
- Good cargo space but less than the 2008 and 2012 models.
- Comes with two separate mats for winter and summer.
- Well priced for a SUV.

2014 RAV 4 Con:
- It has absolutely no leg space in the back passenger seats. It is impossible for normal height and tall people to seat comfortably at the back. It has less space than a normal sedan. The inside is tiny.
- The integrated software system for GPS and audio control is very bad and full of flaws.
- Consumes way more gas then the two previous models I drove.
- It has only two storage compartment at the front, smaller in size than the previous models. The previous models had multiple small compartments that were convenient to store things like sunglass, spare change for emergency and other electronic items like phones out of sight. The 2014 model have none of these. The compartment they made to keep phone is out in the open and every time the car stops even decelerating gradually, it slips and falls on the floor.
Overall, Toyota made 2014 RAV 4 cheap by cutting out all the useful, convenient little things. If you had a previous model with good features, don't change to this new model. If you are buying a RAV 4, buy a previous model with added features. I drove 2008 and 2012 models; they are very good, reliable cars with a better fuel mileage. If I had a Limited edition of 2012 RAV 4, I definitely would have kept it.
Good luck!"
"09  5, 2014",Third Toyota I've Owned,"I've been very satisfied with all 3 Toyotas I've had. I chose the RAV 4 because I needed a car large enough to hold a big dog crate (with the backseats down), but didn't want a huge SUV.
Had the car less than a month, but have been really happy with it."
"08 28, 2014",To Purchase or Not Purchase,"I own a 2014 XLE AWD. I've read the reviews and here are my thoughts:

Likes:
Flat, big cargo space for a little SUV.
MPG is what they claim... Hwy 29-32, City 24-28.
Bluetooth handless phone capability.
Control panel on steering wheel.

Dislikes:
Uncomfortable seat and head rest.
Blind spots due to high door design.
Heated seat option not available.
Glare on monitor screen.
Feels like a high center of gravity. Not stout.
Muffler and pipes visible.
Yes, the hood does bounce.
Funky cruise control post.
Lack of comfortable driver arm rests.
Yes, there is a vibration with windows open.
Unable to activate/deactivate all interior lights with one switch.

Recommendation:
I can't recommend this vehicle primarily because the seats are uncomfortable and there are too many blind spots due to high door design."
"08 22, 2014",Just fine,"I've owned this car for a month - 2014 xle. Purchased this over the Mazda CX-5 because of the price alone (Toyota has bargaining power. Mazda doesn't at this point). I've owned a lot of Toyotas and they all drive pretty much the same. The second I drove this car, I felt comfortable. It responds well, it feels exactly like other toyotas I've owned. I'm not, however, blown away. There is a crazy glare on the screen. I'm technologically savvy and the computer system organization doesn't make any freaking sense. I've read the manual, spent more time than I have on candy crush personalizing the navigation, and I still can't get a seamless experience when driving. The voice command doesn't understand me and I've tried to calibrate it multiple times. Other issues - I have to step back every time I open the back door and there aren't enough storage compartments (I used to own a 2 door Yaris with more small-storage space than this car). Those things aside - it's a toyota and has AMAZING resell value (My yaris depriciated $200 in 5 years) and amazing reliability and my dealer has a great service department. I'm not crazy about this car, but for the money and the company, it's a great choice."
"08 16, 2014",I Love my Rav 4,It's sporty and responsive. I can't imagine owning anything else. Everyone that has looked at it will be considering the Rav 4 for their next vehicle. Toyota makes such a great product!
"08 13, 2014",Best car that I can see out of really good,I can see out of this vehicle all around and love the backup camera.It rides a little like a truck but it has big wheels so that is probably the reason.All in all I like this vehicle.
"08  9, 2014",Overall excellent...some disappointments,"I bought this car to replace a well used and loved 2006 Highlander. The mileage in the RAV4 is substantially higher. It is not quite as large, but will do the job.

I've been driving it for almost a month and following are my comments.

Disappointments:
1. Noisy, jumpy ride
2. Terrible radio
3. No remote opener for garage doors (on top model)
4. No space for sunglasses and other odds and ends
5. Non locking glove compartment (!)
6. Overly complex electronics
7. Hard seats
8. Would like stronger headlights (as I have aged, my eyes get worse at night vision)

What I like:
1. It's a Toyota (dependable and effecient)
2. Nice looking vehicle
3. Decent cargo capacity
4. Power liftgate (reason I didn't consider CRV)"
"08  6, 2014",RAV 4,"Better equipment and technology than a Honda CRV. Trying to get adjusted to a smaller vehicle (sold Ram1500 4X4 Quad Cab) Not a solid as the Rm but better mileage. Choice was between Ford Edge, CRV and RAV4. Edge & RAV4 equal except in price."
"08  3, 2014",Good SUV,"I have owned Toyotas for last 25 years and happy with the performance. With basic maintenance, never had any major problems. New RAV-4 Limited has lots of options that normally I expected in Lexus or luxury car.
Navigation, Backup camera, Blind spot, Lane designation, etc. makes it easy to drive. Ride is not very comfortable as car or van but I expected that being SUV."
"07  9, 2014",Not so pleased,"After driving a 2011 Nissan Rogue, I purchased a RAV4 basically for the looks and Toyota's rep on quality. Trading it in. The seats are hard and uncomfortable and the ride is like a wagon. I can feel every bump! I purchased the XLE and even though it has back up camera, bluetooth, etc, NO electric seats, no sunglass case. I couldve done without the sunroof for electric seats and a better ride!!!"
"06 16, 2014",Realistic Review,"6/16/2014

This is an objective and realistic review from a person who has owned a 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD for two weeks and has completed several 300 mile trips. Male, 5'8"", 180 lbs, age 50.

PROS

- Hwy MPG averaging 31.
- Cargo Space is larger than competition.
- Voice activated Bluetooth cellular functionality.
- Voice and Hand activated stereo functionality.
- Seems like a quiet smooth ride.
- Front seat side cushions are comfortable.
- AWD availability.
- Reliable track record.

CONS

- Nowhere to rest elbows during driving. Uncomfortable. Try it.
- Seat is hard an uncomfortable after 2 hours.
- No neck support...There is a monster head support that doesn't adjust well, but why can't mfgrs make a nice neck support!!
- Very very loud rumble/vibration if rear windows are open during driving.
- Can't read air/heat temperature because the mounting plate is tilted toward sunroof reflection.
- New ""sleek"" design is less functional providing less cargo space and access for large items.
- More door height and less window... personal preference to have more window, less door panel.
- Heated seats not available...Come on gang!!!

I believe the 2014 RAV4 XLE AWD is more ""sporty"" than comfortable and is targeted to the younger generation. I believe the focus is to attract this market with a ""sleek"" design and bells and whistles provided thru the monitor screen. Most of the mini SUV mfgrs appear to be copying each other with this new design.

Personally, I prefer to have more cargo space than a ""sleek"" design so I can fit things into my mini SUV. The loveseat I recently purchased won't fit because they tapered off the back end. Otherwise, it would have fit. I would also prefer more seat comfort, elbow rests and neck rest! If you want comfort, make sure you test drive it several times. The Honda CRV seemed more comfortable but had less cargo area. It is a nice looking vehicle and has some bells to play with, but try to look beyond looks and whistles if you also desire functionality and comfort."
"05 30, 2014",Not as good as CRV,"Rav-4 no sunglass holder, front hood has sun glare, does not take bumps and potholes as good as Honda CRV,rear child locks needed. Leased will tolerate for few years."
"05 29, 2014",Toyota rav4 is the best SUV,If you are on the market for a SUV you can not go past the rav4 becomes it is not that expensive to by and it has a grate re-sale value. Also if you are looking for a SUV that can be used for mol table courses such as for off roading or for camping or for local city driving well I recommend this is the perfect car for you.
"05 26, 2014",one of the most reliable cars i have owned,"viewing excellent, dual air conditioning in front, bluetooth hands off to control phone, and radio, power sun roof, new styling front fenders and rear lights. great car probably the last car I will buy!!!"
"05 20, 2014",First brand new car,It is my first brand new car. I feel so relax by driving it. I definitely love my new Toyota Rav4 and I will recommend my friend to buy it.
"05 19, 2014","Happy with Wellesley Toyota, Wellesley MA","I am very happy with TOyota RAV4. It has a beautiful exterior in greay and the interior is also impressive.

What impressed me was the Sales Manager who sold me the car. He was one of the best representatives of any Toyota dealer I've gone to, Martin Hansberry of Wellesley Toyota explained the features of several makes and i am very happy with his suggestions. We negotiated for a price and I was very happy with our final agreement. I had prevously gone to another dealer in Framingham and was very dissatisfied even though I had purchased three other new Toyotas from that same dealer, Their offer was insulting and I will never go back.
Happily Wellesley Toyota makes me a customer for life.."
"05 17, 2014",great car,"After looking at the Honda CRV and Subaru Forester I decided on the Rav 4. I own 4 Camrys for a business and sold an older one last year with 249,000 miles. Toyota reliability speaks for itself. I got the LE with roof rack, mats and mud flaps. Rides nice with wrap around seats. Great gas mileage compared to my trade in 2003 6 cyl. Mazda Tribute. Engine has plenty of power. Sound system is great with Bluetooth and IPOD capability. I removed the rear seat passenger headrest for better visibility when I don't have passengers. But mirrors are positioned well. Looking out the front window over towards the passenger side front area takes some getting use to as the fender is flared upwards. Would recommend this to a friend for sure"
"05 15, 2014",2014 Rav 4 LE......seat comfort,"Regarding the 2014 RAV 4 LE:
Recently test drove it, then purchased it. Does any one else feel a springy band across the seat cushions which bounces into your butt when you drive? This is a really weird feeling! and it's right under your butt! It appears to be in all the seats, but I feel it especially in the front bucket seats.
If I felt it before I purchased it, I would not have bought it."
"05  8, 2014",Fabulous!,I absolutely love my brand new Rav 4! I am 62 yrs. old and this is my first brand new car and I feel like a queen! It has everything I need in it and more! It drives so smooth and gets great gas mileage! I would definitedly tell my friends to buy one of these!
"05  5, 2014",Reliability,"Love my Rav 4 so far, especially the flexibility of drive modes. Very important to save on fuel. Will reserve final review after I drive through snow!"
"05  3, 2014",2012 Rav 4,"My 4th Toyota, 1st SUV, 1st preowned car. Absolutely love it! Was nervous about preowned, but it's an excellent car. Of course, it's Toyota!."
"05  3, 2014",good value,"I have owned 7 new Toyota's over the years and am constantly amazed at how they choose the ""standard"" features for each model. They don't seem to make any common sense. For example. My new RAV-4 XLE comes with a standard power sunroof which I might use 2 times as year! I would rather have the 8-way power seat which my wife and I would use every day!
Also the placement of the electric outside driver mirror switch is in a difficult location to operate. I have to look down towards the floor and to the far left, totally away from the road. I have to pull over and stop just to change the angle of the mirror! Also to operate the radio is a nightmare, I have been through the manual but cannot understand how to lock in a new station. What ever happened to just turning a knob and pushing a button? It's crazy!"
"05  1, 2014",Tuff for my gsd,"The only things I don't like
1. No Keyless trunk open (offered on limited, but had to get leather seats to get limited)
2. Got to ""pump"" yah seat up w a lever on side. Not electric.
I"
"04 27, 2014",Hooked on Toyota,"This review is based solely on dealer test drives, therefore my ratings on this RAV4 are limited. However, something may need to be asked about driver visibility on this vehicle. I am over six feet and yet when I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful SUV, I see all hood and no road. Even with a height adjustment, this unfortunate design still exists. I owned a 2003 RAV4 and I remember its selling point to me was the clarity of vision while sitting behind the wheel. Am I the only one reacting this way? My wife and I want to buy this vehicle but this is an issue that troubles us. Any thoughts on this?"
"04 23, 2014",nice car,FOCUS ON THE VEHICL'E FEATURES AND BE SPECIFIC. DRIVE THE VEHICLE BEFORE REVIEWING IT. INFORMATION ABOUT PRICE AND SPECIFIC DEALERSHIP.
"04 19, 2014",thought we liked it not at all,we leased 2013 xle its ok ride is terrible accelerates terrible no power very cheap interior not real happy had it for a year wish we got a camry highlander I think were paying to much for that vehicle to
"04 15, 2014",poor Rav-4,This is the worst SUV that i have ever brought...it has not space and have a really bad 4-wheel drive
"04 13, 2014",Updates on 2014 RAV 4,"Back cargo area has insufficient lighting ( adding ) more of my own. Radio control panel/Navigation impossible to use in certain sunlight, Not just a little. Also, some switches behind and lower of steering are very difficult to use because steering wheel blocks them out. Like the cars. but these three things are very irritating to me,. And I think the 2 year, 25,000 mile warranty would have been a deal breaker if I was thinking more clearly."
"04 12, 2014",Two Weeks from Purchase,"I had a tough time in deciding between the Terrain and the RAV4, but more acceleration (translating safety) and wife's comfort in the seats was the final determinant. Previously owning a '06 Camry also pointed toward reliability. Last weekend we took a round trip of about 400 miles, and I perceived a much stiffer ride than that of the Camry, although it is quite nimble in handling, and quieter. I did notice that on bumpy roads the hood vibrated, especially along the back leading edge. (Perhaps I am too picky.) Investigation revealed just a flexible plastic ""support"" structure under this edge, no steel, so no bolstering pad can be applied under the hood there. This design flaw should be ameliorated.

The transmission shifts well, but the audio controls are a bit confusing for old folks, even though we are computer literate.

Would I buy it again after this two weeks of driving experience? Probably, but its just like getting married - its going to take a while to adjust to the changes, and to really KNOW, although you have committed for life."
"04  9, 2014",Perfect starter SUV,"This is a lux, easy to use and drive ""starter"" SUV. It has a comfortable ride and it feels sturdy and safe. I appreciate that it has an eco and sport mode, and it comes with a lot of upgraded features even in the base LE. My only complaint is the touch screen. I wish it was either angled to the driver or had a small lip or visor over it as when the sun is out it becomes very hard to read."
"04  8, 2014",Smooth Driving Machine,This is a reliable crossover/SUV with a lot of inner space and comfort for front row and back row passengers.
"04  7, 2014",Great vehicle,Very pleased with this RAV 4!!!!!!! Bought the limited after not planning for anything past the XLE. Turned out to be a great decision! Highly recommended!!!!'mm
"03 22, 2014","nice vehicle, but not totally satisfied","This review is on the 2014 Rav4 Limited Edition.
While the exterior and interior are great to look at....I have some reservations on the vehicle regarding majority of the interior.
1. My #1 complaint is about the touchscreen radio. I wear polarized sunglasses (to minimize glare) but when the sun hits the screen...I can't see ANYTHING on the touchscreen radio!! I have to take my glasses off and then I can KIND of see. They should make the touch screen anti-glare or something because even when not wearing my sunglasses, when the sun hits the screen it is VERY difficult to see anything.
2. There are NO INTERIOR LIGHTING in the glove compartment, center console, or cargo area!!!! So, when it's night time and I have to get something from the glove box or center compartment I have to use the lighting from the top by the rear view mirror. And if I have to get anything in the cargo area at night...forget about it!!! I can't see anything, so I have to get out a flashlight or use my cell phone to look around. Granted, I do have black interior but still...at the very least wouldn't you think that there'd be SOME kind of lighting for the cargo area?!
3. There are very few interior compartments and the center console is pretty shallow compared to other vehicles I've had. At the very least, for the limited edition they could have included a compartment for your glasses. I find myself having to stuff everything into one place since there's such limited room. My smaller Honda Civic had wayyy more compartments and little nooks than this bigger size Rav4.
4. I'm sure they added all of the plastic pieces to the vehicle to save $. It would've been nicer without it, but of course it would've been much more expensive.
Aside from all of that...I will say, the vehicle is a beauty to look at. I really like the different things you can do with the radio, change settings to certain things to fit what you want, and I absolutely love the heated seats. The ECO mode and the SPORT mode are interesting...but I honestly don't feel too much of a difference. The vehicle is very smooth to drive and I'm hoping to be keeping it around for another 10+ years!"
"03 20, 2014",Love my Rav4,Just traded in my 2005 Rav4 for a new 2014 one. Love the interior and the comfort. The outside is beautiful. Interior features I did not know was in there. As always it drives so smoothly and effortlessly. Would not of traded in my old Rav4 but the new features on the new one will make my life easier. I never had a problem with the old one and am sure I will experience the same high quality on the new Rav4.
"03 19, 2014",Can't beat a Toyota,"Out of the other cars in this class that I looked at, I like the fact that the RAV4 sits up a bit higher. I also like that the spare wheel is no longer mounted on the hatch door but located inside, I also like that the hatch door rises up, versus opening from left to right. Much easier for loading/unloading to have the door out of the way.

The back seats fold down fairly flat. I don't have to remove the head rests or move the front seats up any.

I wish that Toyota had kept the lock on the glove box, but I guess they have to reduce costs somewhere. The inside styling is a little more functional and looks nice. The rear view camera is a nice addition.

I love the hands-free calling thru the radio. The sound quality is very good. No more tunnel sounds or wind-rushing sounds on the other end. Easy to set up and use. The voice activated calling is great. I was very surprised. I also like that Pandora, when open on my phone, automatically streams thru the radio as soon as I turn on the ignition.

I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but so far it is great.

The only drawback at this point, is the cloth seat has a seam indentation near the seat-back. At first I thought this was a defect in the cushion, but soon discovered that it is the style of the seat. It is kind of strange to get used to at first, but I'm sure eventually I'll forget about it.

The heated air takes about 5 minutes to warm up when the car is cold, and is not super hot, but adequate to stave of the cold. I find in general, that Toyotas take a bit longer to reach a hot air temperature, compared to other brands.

I also find that I have to be careful to shut the door firmly, otherwise the latch catches, but the door isn't shut all the way. Several times I have failed to shut either the hatch or side doors properly and have to open and re-shut them. Only a minor nuisance.

By the way, this review is based on the LE, automatic transmission. I really wanted the heated seats, but did not want to sacrifice the 3inches of head space for the sun-roof. I think it is a great car and will give me many years of satisfaction."
"03 10, 2014",Love my RAV4!,"I purchased a Camry XLE in December 2013. I HATED it. So, after 2 months of driving it I traded it in for a 2014 RAV4 XLE. It was so worth it. I love everything about this car. I love the way it looks, the interior styling and features, the exterior, the technology, the way it drives-it's *exactly* what I wanted in a new vehicle and I couldn't be happier with it. The *one* thing I do wish it had more of is interior compartments/storage nooks-like a coin compartment or a compartment for my sunglasses. That's the only thing it lacks.
I am so glad that I didn't waste any more time with the Camry and got my RAV4.
I couldn't be happier with it!"
"03  8, 2014",Glad I Purchased,"I originally test drove this car based on a friend's recommendation. He has an older model RAV4 and is pleased with it.

I have been driving my new RAV4 for approximately one month, and I am enjoying it! The only reason for 4 stars in the ""Comfort"" category is that I find that when getting into the driver's seat, I have to make sure to be positioned perfectly (for me) or, if driving for an extended period, I begin to get somewhat uncomfortable. I think that this problem will go away as the car and I ""get used to each other"", so not a biggie in the downgrade department.

One review I read (before buying) did not think the car had fast enough acceleration when in the ""eco"", or efficient gas mode. However, I keep it in ""eco"" all the time and have not had any trouble safely accelerating while entering highway traffic. Also, my latest MPG was 26 combined town and highway, with more local than highway driving.

In short....I love this vehicle and think Toyota has done an outstanding design job! I can't think of an item they may have overlooked."
"03  5, 2014",Love my Rav4,"I've had my car for over a month and really love it. The seats are comfortable and everything is within reach when driving. The blue tooth does not work as well as I wish it did, but I bought the car for its reliability and safety. So far I am getting better gas mileage than my 2007 Camry (it was a v6). The drive is smooth and if I want a little more kick, I can change from the eco setting to the sport setting. If I could change anything, I wish the back window was a little larger and that I could get more visibility out of it especially when trying to zip in and out of traffic. Other than that, it's a winner."
"03  5, 2014",My favorite car of all time,"This is my third Rav4. I owned a 2001 and 2005 Rav4 previously. I needed a bigger car in 2008 and the Sienna felt a little small. I purchased a 2008 Chrysler Town & Country. What a mistake that was, I had nothing but problems from the day I purchased it. It is a beautiful car but poorly built. I have NEVER had a problem with my Rav4's so I went back to that. It is the best car ever!!!
Thank you Toyota!
Catherine"
"02 25, 2014",Over & above my expectations!,"My family has always had Fords, but we wanted to try a lease and had seen the good deals on the Toyota Rav 4 - went to Spitzer in Monroeville and dealt with Jim Yoxall - he was excellent! He took the time to explain the lease to us, and answer any questions we had on the car, it was over and above all my expectations! It handles so smoothly, ride is extremely comfortable, has many features and has done wonderful on gas mileage for us. The car has done extremely well in the bad weather we have recently had in PA, and I would highly recommend this car! If anyone is unsure of a Toyota take a trip to Spitzer and ask to talk to Jim and see what a good deal and exceptional vehicle hecan put you in. I will definitely return to Spitzer to deal again when our lease is up."
"02 19, 2014",Great experience,I recently bought a Rav 4 from a salesmen by the name of Shawn. He was very knowledgeable and fun to work with. I had a great experience and I feel like everyone should know.....Go see the boys of Lakewood Toyota!!
"02 14, 2014",Fun and Sassy to Drive,"This vehicle has surpassed my expectations in almost every way. Just turned 10K miles. Fun to drive and a wow factor too. I purchased it for local, run around yet overall smaller than the previous Sienna . It fit those profiles. Now, unexpectedly I've had to make to long haul trips (750 mi) each way and guess what? Quiet, smooth, exceptional handling and good gas mileage too. These I did not expect with a small SUV. The ""sport mode"" really gives this little engine some get up and go! Usually drive in the economy mode though. I do wish I had bought the auto rear deck opener. I think a good value with Toyota quality included."
"01 30, 2014",Good Reliable compact SUV for my daughter,Good and nice small compact SUV for daughter. so she can go to college and work.good gas milege and saving money
"01 16, 2014",my 2014 not as good aS OUR 2011,"OUR 2014 DOES NOT COMPARE TO OUR 2011

BUT WE DO LIKE THE MISSING OUTSIDE SPARE
THE SEATS COULD USE MORE PADDING
THIS ONE DONT HAVE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS"
"01  7, 2014",Third New Toyota,"Toyota's have always given me excellent service. They are reliable, well- built and affordable.Sales staff highly professional and courteous. Volunteered information and advice that made purchase experience very enjoyable."
"11  2, 2023",MY Rav4,"Bought car in 2017 with 6000 miles, only changed battery at 40000 miles,good on gas,lots of room,I would buy this Rav4 again new thank you"
"07 24, 2023",Love mine,I love my Rav 4.  No problems at all.  Granted I am a 70-year-old granny but totally worth it in all respects.  Perfect size for me too
"07 18, 2023",Dangerous and uncomfortable.,The car could use more power. The driver seat back is at a poor angle side by side. The car will automatically apply the front brakes in certain turns at normal speeds. This becomes dangerous in clover leaf exits. The Toyota dealer can't fix.
"02  4, 2023",Expensive to maintain. Noisy.,"Transmission, Transfer case, differential fluid changes $800. Water pump failed at 79k, $750.  Road noise at highway speeds intrusive, can't carry on a conversation in the passenger compartment."
"07  8, 2022",What is wrong with the 2015 RAV4,I have to jump start the battery in winter and now in the Texas heat.  I received a letter from headquarters that I needed to get the battery and installation checked/repaired. In Odessa Texas the dealership said no. The recall was a mistake yet I had to jump it 7/7/22.
"03 16, 2022",I am very disappointed in the 2015 Toyota Rav,"in 2020 my Toyota Rav 2015 model- was constantly in the shop getting fixed.
The bottom of the dash needs to be reconfigured. While getting in the car, my knee bumps the bottom of the dashbord.  There are power windows but no power seats."
"06 14, 2021",reliable toyota,"This car drives smooth. I only buy toyotas.this car is very roomy and I love the features in the car, for example blind spot light warnings, blue tooth in car etc..."
"06 12, 2021",Nice car,"This car met all I need and I feel comfortable when I drive it and looks nice too, and clean every thing on it perfect really"
"05 11, 2021",You can't go wrong with a RAV44,"Bought my RAV4 used about a month ago and I love it. There's loads of legroom for passengers and plenty of space for cargo. You could easily fit a bike, patio set, or other bulky cargo in the back with the seats down. 
The interior is plain but nice and functional, though the infotainment software is really slow.
Driving feels great! The steering is buttery smooth and it rides smooth and quiet on the highway. Acceleration from a standstill is impressive for an SUV though at higher speeds its a little less exhilarating but still fully capable of passing on the highway. 
Again, you really just can't go wrong with this car."
"04 21, 2021",Nicest car I have ever owned.,"This car is comfortable, decent on gas.   It's fun to drive and perfect for our family.  The kids have plenty if room.  And lots of room in the back."
"04  1, 2021",Great performance,"It's been a month since i bough a Rav4 from them and everything has turned out well.  The engine sounds so cool , transmission is smooth and the exterior is spotless ."
"02 24, 2021",Love my new ride!,"My mechanic recommended I get a Rav4 after many years of owning Honda’s. Last 2 cars were CR-V’s, so I wanted something similar but newer. Definitely am enjoying it so far!"
"01 22, 2021",She loves her Toyota!,"Great crossover!, it’s beautiful and runs great, wife sure loves it! Toyota’s are legendary for their longevity so this should last us a very long time!"
"11 20, 2020",The upgrade I didn't know I needed,"A more durable feel than expected. I drove a Hyundai Santa Fe before and it was a nice SUV, however I like the overall performance of my RAV4 a lot more. The RAV4 has everything you could ask for. Plenty of space, affordable, and long lasting value."
"10 22, 2020",Test drive and purchase of RAV4 XLE,"I was trying to find a comparable car to my Pontiac Vibe that I love.   Drives wonderfully, very roomy and comfortable with a lot of exras."
"10 17, 2020","Great millage, Performance, Styling","Perfect for travel, family outings,  or day to day  travel. A Safe and reliable SUV that is  great for a load of grand children and their activities."
"09 18, 2020",Despite the poor buying process i like the car,"Ive done alot of research on this particular car so i knew i wanted it long before i got. Unfortunately i seem to have bought it from the wrong dealership: Philly Auto Group in Levittown, PA. First time buying should not be this much of a burden or headache. Never again"
"09 15, 2020",It is a very economic and durable vehicle we have,We have enjoyed this car and never have had any issue. We purchased it brand new and had all the services done on timely manner.
"08 11, 2020",Rav 4,This car definitely meets our family needs. We love how reliable our car is. No more breaking down like we did with our old car
"08  4, 2020",Reliable like other Toyota’s I’ve owned,I like the room in this car but it’s not too big. Drives nice. My only regret is that I didn’t order an automatic lift gate. Next time.
"07 14, 2020",Practicality over luxury.,"This car met all of the needs I was looking for. We love Toyotas, and if we didn't drive those we'd drive Hondas. Keep in mind this car is for practicality, not luxury. The car drives very smooth & brakes and accelerates very well, which is something I thought i'd have a harder time adjusting to since I drove a Camry originally. It doesn't have all the bells & whistles that its Ford and Chevy counterparts have, but that's because it is in my opinion the best car mechanically & reliably. My Camry gave me basically no issues in my 5 years in driving it. The Rav4 has the features that were important to me such as Bluetooth,  a backup camera & good gas mileage. I even lost some cosmetic features that I had in my camry but overall it's an amazing SUV & I appreciate having cars that don't cause me additional financial and inconvenience headaches."
"06 30, 2020",Ok car. Saved my life in a accident,This is my 6th rav 4. My last one got totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver. I honestly wasn’t going to get another one but because it saved my life I ended up getting another rav 4. Here’s what I love: my back door that I press a button and it goes up and down. Love my heated seats and my sunroof. I have the limited edition one. I hate my leather seats. It’s so uncomfortable to drive. Speakers are awful. It does have great pick up though compared to my traverse. Toyota is so behind other brands with everything. I have a 2010 Chevy traverse and it has way more options in it and way better stereo in it.both my rav and traverse have back up cameras but I like my traverse one better as it beeps when you get close to things. My rav doesn’t .  I am due to get another vehicle soon. And prob not getting another rav. I get better gas milage using my traverse which is a lot bigger of a vehicle then the rav
"05  8, 2020",A beautiful smooth riding and very functional car.,"Overall GREAT!
This is a very Roomy, beautiful car with many nice options like heated seats, moon roof. Performance is good and I’m very happy!"
"04 25, 2020",A Vehicle I’ve Been Wanting FOREVER!,"This car is roomy, has plenty of updated functionalities, and is the perfect midsize SUV. I love the sunroof, seat warmers, and spacious trunk. My only concern would be the steering. Unsure if there was a previous issue with the power steering, so it’d be nice if the wheel glided more easily. Other than that I’m happy with the car!"
"04 12, 2020",Very reliable. Never any issues..,RAV has been a good car. Few things they could improve on. Seats are really cheap. The fabric seats are hard to clean and never take a pet with you that sheds. Even the leather seats in a  friends RAV are really cheaply made. Same seat with leather. Also it is very difficult to wash the back window because of the spoiler. Otherwise the car has 140000 and never any issues.
"04 11, 2020",3rd Rav4 I have owned loved all of them,"The Rav's have been awesome, my family members have bought like six Rav 4's, this is my 3rd one, we all love em, great comfort and style, great gas mileage, and no maintenance issues at all, great vehicle for the money,  we will keep buying Rav's as long as they keep making them."
"03 21, 2020",Stylish/Safe SUV,"The Toyota RAV 4 gave me peace of mind, knowing its a quality SUV. The safety and reliability ratings  sold me on Toyotas for life!"
"03 16, 2020",Toyota RAV4,This car well built and suits my needs perfectly.  Style is first rate.  The engine is slightly under powered but that isn't a deal breaker.
"03 10, 2020",Love my Toyotas,"I’ve owned only Toyotas for 25 years, and love them. I’m currently on my 5th one, and couldn’t be more pleased with the longevity of these vehicles."
"02 27, 2020",Toyota,"She is a gentle companion to those seeking refuge and transport. She is sleek and efficient on gas and mileage. Makes a perfect mate for a operator that is wild at heart and free spirited... I adore the sunroof versions.

A"
"01  8, 2020",Awesome pickup. Stable AWD and Breaks.,"It's Toyota RAV4 XLE with AWD. Tires, Exterior, and Interior are in excellent condition. It has Low mileage driven by single non smoker person.  Served my purpose to commuting and drive around."
"12 19, 2019",Amazing Little SUV,This little SUV has been a great vehicle. Extremely reliable and economical. Makes an excellent trouble free vehicle to get around in. Performs great in snow.
"11 21, 2019",Love my Rav 4 2015 XLE,"Handles well
Solid feel 
Toyota reliability and simplicity 
Good pick up
Good sound system 
Computer is user friendly
Love the Barcelona Red
Seating is comfortable"
"11 18, 2019",Very nice!,I love this car! I feel like I'm driving someone else's car! It's roomy & comfortable.  I love the safety features and look forward to keeping it for many years to come.
"10  4, 2019",Rav4 #2,"This is my second Rav4 (2015).  Giving my older Rav4 (2009) to my son - that is how much I trust Toyota's cars.
This car is almost perfect.  The interior is kind of bland.   Certainly not as nice as my Rav4 2009 interior but outside is great.  I do miss the wheel being on the outside and losing storage space."
"09 29, 2019",Very reliable car,"This car is what I was looking for in a smaller SUV.  It's gas efficient and very dependable . The back seats are comfortable, they recline."
"09 24, 2019","Love the car, hate the head rests!","I've owned Toyotas since 1976.  They are reliable, comfortable, & indestructible.  My 2009 RAV had very uncomfortable head rests.  I finally put the back head rests on the front seats, which worked great.  My ""new"" 2015 has all the bells & whistles, plus much better seat adjustment options.  However, the head rests in front & back are awful for petite women.  I have to use a head cushion + a neck rest to drive.  Hey, Toyota interior designers - We're not all tall!"
"09  3, 2019",Awesome all around vehicle,"Safe and effective in the snow and foul weather.  Comfortable seating, well appointed. Is a great family car cut also an excellent SUV. :) I highly recommend this vehicle for Fuel Economy, Safety, Long Lasting and Reliability.  BTW  Down below I was forced to chose ""primary use for this car.""  THEY SHOULD HAVE PLEASURE BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IT WAS USED FOR."
"08 25, 2019",Like new   to good to be true,"I bought a 2015 Rav4 from Anderson auto and could not be more pleased great car great experience ,the car is very clean and looks like new"
"08 17, 2019",Nice comfortable ride!,This car was what we needed. It’s reliable and well maintained. I would recommend the Rav 4 to anyone looking for a smaller suv that is good on gas.
"07  3, 2019",One of the best cars I have owned.,This car was good for us very reliable and sturdy. Good gas mileage and handles very well (turning radius excellent) I highly recommend Toyota Products
"06 20, 2019",Ok suv,"This is my 6th rav 4. My last one was totaled in a car accident and saved my life with all the crazy air bags so I bought this one because of my last one saving my life. I hate that Toyota is so behind with everything. I own a 2010 Chevy traverse too and I have way more options in that. I have a limited edition rav 4 (top of the line) and I have more options in my traverse that’s 5 years older. You would think by 2015 Toyota would have lights that turn on by themself and other things. I do like my powered back door. That was why I bought the rav because it was easier for my back to press a button for the back door. I do not like that Toyota made the rav 4 smaller and the storage in the back is awful due to the tire in the storage area so you can’t store anything in there now. My 2012 that got totaled, I had a ton of storage in the back. Also, the gas mileage is awful. It’s supposed to have a gas saving thing that turns on but it doesn’t do anything to save gas. This will be my last rav 4 unless they go back to the old storage ways and catch up with options like all the other companies. The amount I paid for my rav, you would think it would of had drastically more options. I like my heated seats and sunroof and powered back door."
"06 19, 2019","Overall, great crossover",I LOVE everything about my 2015 RAV4 Limited except a moderate amount of road noise. Hopefully  improved with new models. Plenty of room and cargo space. Looks are great! Handles great!
"06 14, 2019",Great car,Great  performance and quiet.  Great mph.  The navigation system is so so.... That has been my biggest disappointment.   It has trouble with voice commands.  I took it in several times and no improvement
"05 30, 2019",Great used car,"Super happy with this car. This is a Limited model with all the nice comfy features but none of the annoying new ""safety"" features. Beautiful inside and out."
"05 26, 2019",A big fat F for design.,"So many annoying features it’s hard to know where to begin. 1) Can’t lock out back window control from kids use because if I push the button for that purpose, then the driver’s control of the back is also locked out.  2) if a door is slightly open, one of the seat belts not all the way in, the emergency break slightly up,  a warning should sound when putting car in drive. But morons designed it so the warning begins to sound when I’m going 35 mph or faster and the sound stops when i stop the car so i have to get out and open and close every door before continuing. The xxxx warning sound should continue until the problem is fixed so i know everything is OK before getting back in car and going 35 mile an hour again.  Many times I’ve had to pull off the interstate trying to figure why the warning sound starts back as I begin to pull off birm back onto highway.  3)The rear dome light cannot be controlled from the front seat. 4) if a door is latched but ajar, and i try to lock the car with the key fob as i walk away from the car, the car starts an extended beep sound that continues for several seconds and the doors don’t lock.  The xxxx doors should lock anyway!  perhaps a little longer beep to let me know, not a long beep that tells everyone in the world that my car is not locked. 5) there are 3 buttons that control two front dome lights. The sequence gets so screwed up the light comes ON when I CLOSE the door. I have yet to find the magical setting that causes the dome light to come on when I open the door, a feature i enjoyed hastle-free with every other car I’ve ever owned. 6) the back hatch door is so poorly designed my wife can barely open or close it. Probably built that way to increase sales of power lift. 7) the windshield motor puts so much force on the arms that occasionally, the arms bend in normal operation during rain.  8) after 3 years use, the cigarette lighter does not work and there never was power at the usb outlet(fuses are all good) 9) I sometimes want to use the headlights to see something in the dark while the car is parked without the car running. Can’t do that.  Imagine if your car becomes inoperable, your headlights will not be available for use or warning either. 10) if you forget to remove the key from the ignition, your car battery will die. LOL your headlights cut out after 10 seconds with the key in the ignition, but the battery dies after a while anyway.  and on and on!!  Rav4 sucks! Did Toyota just go design bankrupt? My 2005 tacoma had no such issues"
"05 19, 2019",Dee’s Happy,I love this vehicle and the dealership was awesome. Cross another thing off my list. I’m glad I looked on cars.com and found the vehicle I wanted. Thanks!
"05 18, 2019",all my toyotas are reliable. love toyotas.,I love the rav4.  For a midsize car it has plenty of room for people and dogs. It does not break down and only needed oil and filter changes.
"05  1, 2019",The 2015 Rav4 is the best car I have owned....and,This car is great...I love it it runs good.a little bit more gas...but other then that it's a good running car and got a lot of room and that hatched is big to its get me to wear I need to go with no problems
"04 26, 2019",most reliable car I've owned,"This car met all my needs has plenty of legroom in front and back, the ride is great compared to other cars I  tested ,  would recommend  lancaster   toyota  to friends."
"04 12, 2019",Best Toyota Ever!,This vehicle is great! Perfect transition to a SUV from a Corolla. More cargo space and back seat leg room. The  front seat is similar style to a Corolla so it as an easy transition for all the controls I was used to!
"04  3, 2019",I think Toyota pickups,"Lift gate motors where not working properly, getting stuck in open position, I seen it on utube, it’s 2015 with 36k cost 1,737 to replace what they already know"
"04  2, 2019",Best car I’ve ever own it,"Is a great car for all my family, is reliable and very fun, also is friendly with the environment and confortable. Best choice for my family"
"03 17, 2019",2015 RAV4 is better than I had hoped for,"We got a 2015 Limited because it had a few extra niceties we wanted.  Our last 3 purchases, all used, have had high-end trims. It is much more cost effective to get loaded models , as they original purchaser covered the mark-up for all the options.

This vehicle rides and handles better than I expected for a midsize SUV.  This is our 3rd Toyota, so reliability is not even a concern.  I also considered a Venza, same model year, but they were more costly and harder to find.

I was driving a Mazda3, which has over 200k miles, so I wanted to give the CX-5 a chance, but the test drive didn't compare well to one on the RAV4."
"03 12, 2019",We just bought it last night,This car made it easier for my wife and I to get in and out of we have a 2016 tundra and we love it but it doesn’t get the gas mileage this car does so we will definitely be taking it on our long trips to save on gas
"03  9, 2019",Good Car,My wife likes the car because she sits up higher but it is compact enough not to feel like a mini van. Features are good. Given broken parts by the selling dealership but that doesn’t take away from the vehicle.
"03  8, 2019",Should last us forever,"Toyota’s are well known for their quality. They simply don’t wear out. The features on our RAV4 are great, and we average 26+ mph (fwd). We got a lifetime Powertrain warranty with it from the dealer (provided all maintenance is done there), but as the salesman put it, they offer that because they know they won’t need to do anything to the vehicles."
"03  1, 2019",Love this car last 2 cars were Toyota’s,"Compact, peppy, sporty, fits in garage of 1940 y.o.. home. Needs light in cargo area and better mechanism to unlock trunk and handle for lifting up."
"02 28, 2019",Most reliable car!,It drives so smooth. Love it! It suits all my needs and is great on gas. It's also very roomy which means alot to me since I have 3 large dogs.
"02 20, 2019",best car ever,two thumbs up. I would buy another rav 4 here anytime. Great vehicle and very reliable. no issues at all. I feel like this vehicle will last me forever.
"02 18, 2019",Just bought it 2 days ago.  A really nice vehicle.,"The SUV has a great ride and fantastic technology capability.  Very satisfied with this purchase.  The gas mileage will help in commuting and the car should be great on vacation, too."
"02 12, 2019",A nice reliable small SUV that will get me around,"So far I have enjoyed its comfort and reliability.
 I have looked at many small SUVs. 
 I have looked at RAV4’s for a long time.
 So when it came time to buy I stayed with a name that I trust, Toyota."
"02  5, 2019",Love my RAV4!,The Toyota RAV4 has everything I’ve ever wanted in a vehicle and I couldn’t be happier I made this purchase. It has just enough room for what I need it for and has an eco mode to save big on gas. Toyota never disappoints.
"01 27, 2019",Comfortable Ride,This is a comfortable car with good views from the back window and side mirrors.  I enjoy driving it and feel safer than I did with my previous car.
"01 23, 2019",Best car I've owned,"The Rav4 met all my needs on so many levels. It has the room to transport almost anything we need to move, including our 3 Great Pyrenees dogs. It's ver comfortable and I'm finally comfortable driving in snow with something that can handle the bad roads in Wisconsin winters"
"01 20, 2019",Too soon to tell,"Being I have only owned for one day, but have already used in the snow/ice/rain/sleet mix throughout the first day, I have enjoyed the handling and am pleased. It’s not a land rover, but since the price of those are quite a bit steeper, I am still pleased with how the Rav 4 performed on its first day with me."
"01 18, 2019",Beautiful design and smooth drive. I love this car,I purchased this car after reading many reviews. It’s design is what caught my eye and after i test drove it i could see what the fuss was about. It has a lot of space and is smooth.
"01 11, 2019",A perfect fit for me,2015 rav 4.  It’s the right size. All wheel drive. Efficient. Capable in the winter.  A little road  noise but fixable with dynamat in the doors.
"01 11, 2019",I absolutely love my car!,"I recently traded in my 2016 Scion iA because that car was just too small especially with having kids. I upgraded to the 2015 Toyota RAV4 and I was not disappointed. There is SO much room inside the car and I didn’t lose any truck space that you would get with a sedan vehicle. It has nice power, spacious interior and comfort with style. I would recommend a RAV4 to anyone looking for a reliable, spacious family vehicle."
"01  7, 2019",I Picked A Winner!,This car is amazing! I went out looking for a preowned RAV4 because it has a great reputation for being reliable. Everyone I spoke to who owns a RAV4 said they would purchase another one. This car has a lot of leg room in the front and back and more than enough room in the back to carry things. I can adjust my seat up and down to fit my needs. I was surprised with the pick up this car has while merging onto the highway. The rear mirror is a big plus! The sleek exterior is icing on the cake. I look forward to many years with my RAV4!!
"01  6, 2019",Fuel efficiency,"This is  my dream car, really  comfy and when I drive, I enjoy my trip . fuel efficiency, foldable back seats Over all it’s a great SUV.👍👍👍👍👍"
"12 23, 2018",Very reliable vehicle,This vehicle has met all of my needs and more. Great vehicle for the price I would purchase again. Good mileage performance ease of w
"12 10, 2018",Most reliable car I want to own,It's a 2015 Toyota 4Runner Limited very nice automobile got all the options very pretty car pearl paint job it would be very good car for my future easy to handle
"12  4, 2018",Really like it,"So far,so good. I have only owned it since June,but I like it so much more than my last car. I had a Chevy Malibu that died at 78,000 miles.  I have high hopes for this car."
"12  3, 2018",Great car,This car is great. The drive is smooth. I have alot of trunk space and have enough room for passagers that i wasnt able to do with my old car. All in all love the car
"11 25, 2018",Very comfortable and solid car,I like the performance and the reliability of this vehicle. I plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time. I look forward to driving in the snow with this vehicle.
"11 24, 2018",Toyota is the best,"Love the style and handling, it could use more power but I like it much better than the Honda CRV and Ford Escape. Best buy for the money."
"11 22, 2018",Sturdy and Reliable,Had it less than one week. But it appears to be a solidly built CUV. A practicle car for a single person or a new family living in a city where the transit system has made a personal vehicle a necessity

"11 18, 2018",Loved leasing the 2015 Rav4!,"We loved leasing this car; it served us well for 3 years!

The car has great interior design, and is fun to drive.  In the Limited edition, which we had, it was loaded up with great features including memory seat, heated seats, power liftgate, etc.  My favorite features are the touch-sensitive door handle locking & unlocking from exterior - you don't have to find a button in the dark- and also the classy interior finishes and stitching.

The only downsides are slight; the sliding lid on the center console sometimes slides unexpectedly when you put your weight on it to shift your body in the seat.  Also, the voice recognition is not very effective.  Finally, at night I wish more of the interior buttons were lit up; for example the seat memory buttons don't light and I have to turn on the cabin light to avoid hitting the wrong one."
"11 18, 2018",Love my Rav 4!,"I have loved my Toyota RAV4. It?s been incredibly reliable and comfortable, great for long road trips.  It is a safe , solid car with a good sound system."
"11 13, 2018",Pleasant surprise,"We were looking for an SUV and decided to check out the ""small"" Rav4 as a reference.  We were thrilled with the performance and all the features it had.  It's a great car so far!"
"11  7, 2018",Great driver,Right mirror top fell off and strangely the same happened to our previous Corolla. What gives? Otherwise interior space great. Handles great smother ride would be appreciated.
"11  5, 2018",Never owned a Toyota and I just love it.,This car met all my needs.  It drives so smooth and quiet.  There is plenty of leg room in front and back and is really comfortable.  Gets great gas mileage and has all the options that I needed.
"11  4, 2018","Great car,hard to use GPS.","Overall nice vehicle, however navigation system is hard to use to find addresses. Been back to dealer two times for instructions still find it hard to use for seniors."
"10 30, 2018",Best Car,The car is how it lives up to be. Parking has become easier due to the compact size. It fits my busy lifestyle. I love how it?s inexpensive to put in gas. It?s just pure perfection!
"10 27, 2018",Great car~,"The car has some very convenient features, is very comfortable and drives great! It had only 31,000 miles so it was like a brand new car. It was kept in great condition."
"10 27, 2018",Loved this car!,I leased my RAV4 for 3 years I absolutely loved the car! I was looking to purchase the vehicle after my lease was up but ended up getting another car. There wasn't anything I could complain about. Good leg room great for road trips
"10 20, 2018",Beautiful and drives excellent,"Car met my family need,excellent gas mileage. Beautiful interior and exterior.  I luv the low mileage and rear view camera and Bluetooth option. Luv it"
"10 17, 2018",Most Reliable car I have ever owned,I have never owned an SUV style of car and really wanted a car that was higher up and had more room. When I saw the car I thought it was simply great! Then when I drove the car I absolutely fell in love. The car rides so smooth and is perfect for traveling. 10/10 recommend!!!
"10  5, 2018",Toyota Reliablity a key.,"Not really needing but wanting a SUV I began hunting around various dealers .  The RAV4 hit all the right buttons of what I needed and several features I wanted.  As a Realtor , passenger area comfort and good looks is very important.  As frequenct travelers, comfort , enjoyment, cargo space and good MPG are crucial too.  Check check and check. We?ve had Toyota?s on the past and they are super reliable and long lasting with proper care.  So far so good in the RAV4!"
"10  2, 2018",Best car I?ve owned for traveling on tripz,"This Rav is well layered out. Instramentation panel easy to read. Blue Tooth works well. Plenty of passenger room and cargo space. Plenty of  power which was surprising for a 4 cylinder.  The only complaint is the bottom door seal. The design allows slush, salt and mud to build up between bottom of door and lower door frame. Constantly cleaning it out in winter months."
"09 26, 2018",Great Vehicle,Great reliable SUV to have. Pretty good with the design and performance.  Great fuel economy.Just needs improvement on the comfort and outside /engibe noise reduction
"09 16, 2018",It was ok-,"Well it is a Toyota . But all of these SUV?s are basically the same. All are styled exactly alike. The Toyota?s are unfortunately over priced. Hyundai , Kia, GMC are just as good but less expensive. When I buy one ,, it will either be a Hyundai or a Volvo... Hyundai has an incredible warranty , Volvo is made to last.."
"09 11, 2018",Just what I was looking for thanks to cars.com,Love this car it?s  spacious  inside looks good drives good feels good Just love it I would recommend it to anybody who wants a small SUV.
"08 26, 2018",RAV4 for reliably,"Reliable ,hold their value and all-around great family car. Great for commuting, great for taking the family to weekend sporting events. Love the leather or cloth options."
"08 25, 2018",Excellent car and highly reliable,"Ideal family car, very spacious compared to the competitors in the category. This is a highly reliable vehicle and Toyota's warranty and service coverages are top notch.
The only problem I suffered was the rodent attacking the electrical wiring systems and Toyota doesn't have a right solution for it so far."
"08 25, 2018",Toyota?s designing is awesome on RAV4,Only had this rav for 3 weeks now but so far it has been great lacking in performance but styling is great i have the limited so it has numerous accessories which I like I bought it because Toyota?s are build to last
"08 25, 2018",Just Purchased a Toyota RAV4,"I've been looking for a Newer Vehicle for a few year's now. I found. 2015 Toyota RAV4 Limited fully loaded and it has everything in it that my f-150 Ford doesn't have. Plus I love the fact that, I can drive from NC to Michigan and not have to stop for gas a bunch of times!!! I Love My RAV4!!!"
"08 21, 2018",Happy with Cert Used Rav4,"The RAV4's ride is firmer than sedans, etc, but that is good.  Handling is fine.  Overall quality is fine.  On my first long trip the RAV4 got 28.8 MPG which was consistent with the EPA highway estimate.  The Sport Mode for traction gives 50/50 front/rear power distribution for AWD, which should help in the Winter but have not been in snow with it yet.  The only quirks are in the interior where there does not seem to be any convenient coin holder, and the cup holders could be a bit larger in diameter."
"08 20, 2018","Prior to this vehicle, a 1998 Toyota CRV.","This Rav4 was just what we were looking for. We have looked for a 6 month period at many makes, and chose this Rav4, both for the vehicle and the dealer."
"08 18, 2018",Good choice,Nice choice for an SUV. Good size and design for people with no children. Great gas saver. AC is very efficent and great for summer.
"08 15, 2018",Just purchased a 2015 rav 4 love it,"I traded off a 2013 Ford focus witch was a nightmare on wheels. I own a 1986 Toyota truck 4 wheel drive and love it, so I had to get another Toyota and the Rav 4 is everything I need and or want in a small SUV the comfort is outstanding, gas mileage is great sound system rocks I feel so blessed to have bought such a nice vehicle"
"08 14, 2018",This is my 3rd RAV4 .,"I purchased a Suburu Forester a year ago after owning 2 RAV4?s since 1996.  The 96 went to my daughter in 2005 when I bought my new 2005, she drove it till 2011.
I traded my 2005 in 2017 for the suburu. I wasn?t happy .  So I traded it and came back home to my RAV4.  I hope it will serve me as well as my others."
"08 10, 2018",Most reliable car I owned,I love it. It?s so spacious especially for grocery shopping. It?s great on gas. I feel very safe when driving it.  I like the tinted windows

"07 31, 2018",Excellent car,"This was exactly the car that we needed, because of fuel economy, comfort, styling, and performance. I was also satisfied with the service that I received at the dealer."

"07  9, 2018",Love this vehicle,"I couldn?t be happier with it, it?s super reliable, stylish and comfortable. I use it to travel long distances to camping music festivals. It?s got plenty of room and made it from Boston to Michigan like a dream. It?s amazing on gas compared to the 8cyl cars I used to drive. If you?re looking to get a vehicle and not have to worry about a thing after, this is the one for you!"
"07  6, 2018",Reliable 24/7,"Meets most of my needs. Wish it were a little bit faster, a little quicker off the line. Luxurious ride, but not for a driving enthusiast as it?s not an engaging ride. Easy access and hauler for my 2 dogs: 1 small & 1 large. 
Great for easy access of friends, colleagues and seniors/parents. Tons of headroom: best in class I?d say. 
Softex-faux-leather is easy to clean! Super easy to park, and the driving position is high for a great perspective  of the road."

"06 25, 2018",Great Sporty SUV,We purchased this car used and have had it for 2 months now.  We have taken it on 2 long road trips and driven it everyday since we purchased it.  It has met all our expectations and exceeded most.  The only minor complaint is that we live in a hot climate and there are no air vents in the back seat.

I am over six feet tall and there is tons of leg room in the front and back and lots of head room too!  I am very happy with its powerful four cylinder engine and AWD drivetrain.  It costs a little more than Ford, Dodge, and Chevy but worth every penny with its reliability."

"06  8, 2018",Toyota wins again!,"Great gas mileage, comfortable ride, handles well! After driving a Highlander for many years, I was reluctant to switch to the Rav.

Very happy...economical, safe and a quality vehicle. Thanks, again, Falmouth Toyota!"

Interior is very very nice and over the top comfortable.  I drove several other makes/models/brands (all small what I consider SUV's)) and liked them - last car I drove was this RAV4.

It?s large enough to give me a sense of security while driving while not being too bulky when having to park in small spaces.  Great for shopping trips;  the trunk is deceptively large and I?ve been able to keep groceries from multiple places plus a stroller and other items in the back at thre same time
"05  1, 2018",Just purchased Certified 2015 Toyota RAV4,"So far we love this vehicle.

"03 23, 2018",Awesome SUV,I just bought a Toyota RAV4 xle this week. It handles a lot more smoothly than I expected. The gas mileage is an adjustment as I?ve driven a sedan my whole life but from what I hear about trucks and suvs the rav does pretty well in comparison. The seats are the most comfortable seats I?ve sat in in a vehicle. It ya does bumps and turns with grace. I?m impressed so far!
"03 22, 2018",Absolutely love the RAV4,"This car has been absolutely wonderful! It drives wells, is safe, stylish, and is a car I can keep for a long time. so happy with my purchase!"

Cons:  1. Slightly louder road noise than some competitors.

"03  5, 2018","Entune radio went out on me at 40,000 miles.","Other than the radio,it is a nice vehicle.
Toyota offered a $600 $400 split on a new radio only because of my customer loyalty.



The Entune radio sucks a replacement is $1000.00
Toyota said since I was a loyal customer they would pay $600 and me $400 one time only."
"02 27, 2018",Great vehicle,Vehicle exceeds my expectations smooth ride comfortable interior do a lot of commuting very reliable love to drive it salesman Frank Aversa was very polite and knowledgeable

"01 29, 2018",Most unconformfortable drive I've ever owned,"My vehicle is used so I thought it would be broke in good.  If I drive a short distance to work I'm fine, but an hour or longer is very uncomfortable.  There is no give in the driver's seat so after about an hour, my back hurts.  I have no history of back trouble at all.  I thought this would have the same comfort level as my Honda, but it does not.

The gas mileage is poor considering it is only a mid-sized vehicle.  During an average week of driving, I averaged just over a half a tank in my Honda and the same miles driven in this Toyota will consume about 7/8 of the tank.  Considering this was a step down, the price shouldn't have been so high!  I won't recommend this to a friend because most of my friends needs a car that yields good mileage."
"01 18, 2018",My first Toyota,I am in love ....with my first Toyota.   It?s perfect.  I feel safe. Especially for the winter.  I needed a reliable and dependable. Vehicle  with all wheel drive.

"01 12, 2018",Not bad but not great,"I like the pick up even for v4 its not too bad. cars good at economy(25-35mpgs) comfortable interior wise, and is very roomie.

dislikes would have to be ride comfort and lack of basic feature for example I know this isn't a lexus but manual seat controls...like really."
"01 11, 2018",Nice car to drive and very safe,"I love it because is a reliable, nice, safe car to drive. I have got so may compliment and the dealer made easy for me to afford it. It was a pleasure to do business with Nick T."
"01 11, 2018",Love my Rav4,I've only had this car a couple days but so far I am very happy with the way it handles.  The Rav drives nice and has a nice ride.  I'm looking forward to future road trips
"12 30, 2017",Most safest car I have owned,Great 5 star crash rating I totaled it all air bags went off and I walked away with out a scratch or bruise on me!! We turned around mud and bought another Rav 4 we love it!!
"12 26, 2017",Best car I've ever owned.,"I love my car. Very dependable. I feel safe in this car. Comfortable and reliable. Lots of leg room, front and back."
"12 23, 2017",Great SUV,"I purchased this car for business.  I drive over 20,000 miles per year.  I wanted  a reliable car that could handle all conditions.  This is the car.  It is comfortable and easy to drive.   I have over 20,000 miles and all it needed was two oil changes."
"12 22, 2017",Realible car!,I purchased a used 2015 Toyota RAV4 Limited model with a lot of options and under 20k miles. The features and smart key are a nice touch. ECO mode is plus. I really like the looks of this car. This car met all my needs.
"12 21, 2017",Love my RAV4,"Great sized vehicle, not too small, not too big.  Love it! Not my first Toyota! Great dependability, economical, nice upgrades available, and the price was right in my budget."
"12 21, 2017",RAV4 LE is a GREAT car!,"This is the second RAV4 that I purchased. I put over 100,000 miles on my first one, traveling to the Bronx and back in all kinds of weather--and it was still going strong when I sold it. When I retired, I treated myself to a new RAV4 LE  in Barcelona Red Metallic--a great color.  This car just doesn't rust--or at least it hasn't for me, and looks new. Then there is the interior. RAV4's give you an extremely comfortable ride. It is easy to get in and out of the car, and the seats are the most comfortable I've ever found.  Buyers with children would want to know how safe the car is. It is the most reliable car I've ever had and it really holds the road well. As a teacher, I had nearly a two hour commute (each way) to get to work and would often see cars go out of control during rainstorms or other inclement weather. My RAV4 would always get me to my destination safely. Maybe that's because I maintained it on a regular basis. But, I believe it is the quality of the car itself that makes this vehicle last so long. It was clearly built to last. 
The back area seats 3 people comfortably, and the seats go down to provide more storage space. The hatchback lifts all the way up--making it easy to load suitcases, or other items that won't fit in an average-sized trunk. I've had several other vehicles over the course of my lifetime, but found the Toyota RAV4 to be the best."
"12 17, 2017",Great performing car,Met need for college student.  Comfortable interior seating and solid handling.  The all-wheel drive is a plus for poor weather.
"12 13, 2017",Repeat Purchase,"I finally broke down and bought my new RAV4 after the door handle of my 1999 RAV (with 358,000+ miles and still going) broke and my husband stated that I HAD to get another vehicle (he worried every time I got on the road)
I love this vehicle!  Very little road noise, much roomier, the back up camera is wonderful.  I enjoy radio (great sound).  It is easy to maneuver and I don't have blind spots.  And the phone in the car is amazing.  We have had a lot of laughs listening to text messages in the ""lady's"" sultry voice.  My husband, who is 6'4"", didn't fit well in my 1999 RAV, but he fits in this model and is comfortable.   A winner all around!  (And I still haven't gotten rid of my 1999 RAV)"
"12 11, 2017",Great family car,"Its a great entry into the SUV market for those that previously owned a sedan. Not too huge, its the perfect size for a small family. I wish the storage in the front seat area was better designed (no obvious place for coins or sunglasses) but it does the job."
"12 10, 2017","Great car, lousy nav system","Everything about the Rav4 is excellent with the exception of the built in GPS.  It?s not too hard to program but using it is difficult.  With most built in GPS systems the Nav ?voice? can be adjusted with the radio volume control - not the Rav4.  You have to dig into system settings to raise or lower the voice.  Also, once you start a route it is almost impossible to cancel it.  The only way I?ve found is through the voice control system, which would be okay but the voice control system is very poor.  Not nearly as good on my previous Chevy or Volkswagen.  If I could give this vehicle 4.5 stars I would."
"12  7, 2017",Liked it so much I bought it twice!,"This is one of the best cars I've ever owned.  I had a 2010 RAV 4 Limited and decided to trade it in when I got high mileage.  After looking at a variety of cars I decided to go with another RAV 4 Limited but a newer year.  It looks good, it feels good, and it drives well.  I do lots of driving for work and I feel comfortable and safe when I am in it.  Good gas mileage and lots of safety features.  You can't go wrong."
"12  5, 2017",Can't go wrong with Toyota,Our second Rav4.  All we buy in our family is from the Toyota Franchise. Good features and highly reliable.
"12  5, 2017","Best most reliable car I've ever,ever owned!!","Where do I start it has everything I need such as all wheel drive when I need it , roomy for the family nice big back to put many things comfortable in the back!!! It's a Toyota need I say too much more, they are reliable for the long haul and that's what you want when you work hard for your living!!! I've had Toyotas in the past and they have gone and gone beautifully!!! This RAV4 suites and meets my every need and Toyota is where I'm staying all the way always!!!!!!  Sooooooo Happy!!!!!!"
"12  2, 2017",Greatest car I?ve ever owned,"This car is amazing! I went from a small 2004 Toyota Camry to this 2015 Toyota RAV4. And I?m not disappointed! I have enough room for the whole family, including the dogs. We are able to tow our jet ski with it which was a must have for me. It is easy to drive and park (I suck at pulling into parking spots if there?s people on either side because I get nervous) so it?s been great for me. The touch screen radio and backup camera are great. The backup comes in handy when needing to hook up the jet ski. My fiancee and I even took this car deer hunting and it drove through gravel and fields just fine. The gas mileage was great while making the five hour drive home from when we picked it up. I believe it was around 34mpg. My fiancee is also a mechanic, so he will NOT let me buy any sort or motorized equipment without him thoroughly looking it over. The RAV4 got his approval right away. He said it was safe and reliable and that we will be able to drive this car for another 15-20 years. Very happy that this is the car we went with as I wanted a Jeep. Glad my fiancee and family talked me out of it."
"12  1, 2017",Great Car,"Performs as well as any car I have ever owned including sports cars.  Great performance either in city or highway.  enjoy the styling, comfort and accessories.  This car has it all."
"11 28, 2017",Excellent handling and comfort,"2015 Toyota RAV4 handles well and offers a smooth ride. I just traded up from 2009 Rav4, which had more storage and hiding spaces. I really prefer the side hinged door to the upper lift"
"11 26, 2017",Good so far,"I just bought this vehicle a couple weeks ago, it works very well so far. Although, a message popped up saying it needed maintenance, that?s an easy fix, I hope."
"11 26, 2017",The most reliable car I?ve ever owned,The reason I bought this car was because of it?s performance and reliability I like the exterior styling and the comfortable interior design
"11 22, 2017",Amazing size as style,I love the ease of driving it. It's a safe and reliable car on the road and has a nice and roomy interior.
"11 21, 2017",Vehicle Review,"Safe, wonderful family vehicle. Love the navigation and features that this vehicle has. I needed something that would help me feel safe on long trips back East to see family"
"11 20, 2017",Great suv strongly recommend to anyone great on ga,Comfy stylish roomy radio speakers good bluetooth..has crusise control nice car for the price ..nice
"11 10, 2017",So far so good!,"Reliable!!!  Looks nice.  Love the all wheel drive!  Roomy with lots of space!  Love the back up scree
N"
"11  9, 2017",Wonderful car!,"All Toyota are great cars, but the Rav4 is perfect for me. I work about 40 minutes away from home so, I am on the road a lot. I feel very safe in my Rav. Having a compact SUV is nice because you have a lot of room inside without feeling like you are driving a spaceship."
"11  6, 2017","Love Toyota?s anyway, but this car drives so nice.","Drive 3 teens to school each day with 3 big backpacks, fits everyone and everything great. Rains a lot in this state and I feel very safe in it,. Love the backup camera also."
"11  3, 2017",My Car,"I purchased this from a dealer. Owned it for a year and drove all type of roads. I could transport the items that i thought it won't fit. No regrets in having this car. 

Amazing Car !"
"11  2, 2017",Reliable car,"This car was a great AWD vehicle. I enjoyed driving it.Very comfortable. The gas tank is a little smaller than most cars but avg MPG was around 24-26. I've been told the Bluetooth sound while calling others had a ""tinny"" sound."
"10 25, 2017",Great Vehicle,This car meets all of my needs as of now. Of course I would have liked to have climate control and moon roof but those are not necessities. Its spacious enough for a family of four and everyone loves it. The mileage could improve a little but I think its still much better than other SUVs in the market.
"10 21, 2017",Great Car,"As a previous owner, we were delighted to test drive this vehicle.  In fact, we bought it.  An upgrade for us include rear camera.  We are so excited!"
"10 19, 2017",A great car at a good price,This is a great car for the working man or women. Although its small in size it has plenty of room for a big guy.  Love the back up camera and blue tooth.  you will be amazed at the performance and turning radius of this Toyota RV 4.
"10 17, 2017",Needed something with a little more space.,This car appears to be large enough to meet my needs.  More space for my golf equipment and dog kennel.
"10 15, 2017",Great car for it's value! Very fun!,This car is great for it's value! Very fun to go off road in road trips. Pretty spacious and comfortable and the cargo size is neat too. Couple of people complained about the performance. Of course this is not a performance heavy vehicle but I had no problems with it during the snow and going a bit off road.
"10  7, 2017",Toyota Rav4 Totally Reliable,"The car is roomy, comfortable, mechanically reliable, good on gas.  It  short coming for me are storage related. The arm rest moves when you lean on it, and there are no innovative storage locations like you'd find in a Jeep Cherokee Latitude under the seat or in the rear of the SUV."
"10  5, 2017",Descent Car with a few flaws,"The 2015 Toyota Rav 4 is a reliable car, but does have some flaws that I believe Toyota could've done better with. First lets start off with the Steering. Sensitivity of the steering  is just outrageous. It is too sensitive to a point where changing lanes could easily make you side-swipe another vehicle. Then comes road noise. I believe more sound dampening materials could've been added to the vehicle to block more noise. Other than that, this is a great reliable vehicle."
"10  2, 2017",It?s the perfect suv for the family,"The RAV4 is good SUV very Reliable, Spacious, very good torque and power for Four-cylinder engine more than you need for your family SUV. Value for the money is great. The only think I don?t like about it is when you drive on the highway the car is loud it?s not Isolated perfectly so there is always a wend sound on the highway and the engine is loud too.Stability is perfect and visibility is one of the best on the market for the category."
"10  1, 2017","Very reliable, and great on gas","This car is very reliable. THe interior is very spacious, and when the back seats are lowered, it hauls almost anything.  The gas mileage surprised me for an all wheel drive vehicle.  When we put winter tires on it, It became a tank in the winter.  It pushes through the snow better than my truck.  Great all around vehicle.  I Love it."
"10  1, 2017",Love my 2015 RAV4!!! (Later Release),"This car has way better MPG than advertised. Also, looks very nice and it?s is quite comfortable. I took it off the road and it was a beast. Great car for the money you pay!"
"09 27, 2017","Great Deal, Seamless Purchasing Process","After reviewing competitive pricing online for Toyota RAV4's for cost perspective, we visited this dealer with our wish list and were immediately taken to a spotless 2015 RAV4 with unbelievably low mileage.  We would describe the car as ""barely driven"".
Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.   
What we thought would be a stressful search for a ""new"" car turned out to be anything but stressful. 
Steve Skolnick, our salesman, was happy and we were happy after a short transaction.  
We love the car and our pleasant sales experience!"
"09 26, 2017",Loving my RAV4 2015,"RAV4 does not need a review because it is prooved to be one of the best vehicles within 30K.  Very comfortable from the first ride.  I had a chance to drive 2017 and 2015.  I chose 2015 as a better value.  I like bigger side mirrors so you could see a few lanes around.  I almost do not need to use rear mirror.  In 2017 they messed with side mirrors, they are smaller, but 2017 has new fixtures like brake assist and cruise control assist.  It is really something to consider"
"09 26, 2017",Most reliable with style and compfort,"This car gives all u need in your car like style size and sefty mileage looks reliablety with confidence,and wourth of investment"
"09 25, 2017",Most practical and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is great on gas, reliable in the winter and comfortable for taking long trips. It is also practical for all kinds of activities since it has a roof rack and plenty of space in the back. It is stylish and compact so it is a great transition for those used to driving smaller cars."
"09 23, 2017",About my RAV4,Very nice SUV for the $ but get the 4WD instead of 2WD if you use it in snow prone winters.  Mine didn't make it up the hill to my house 1 night and cost me a tow to get home
"09 19, 2017",1st new car owned and love it,"So happy with my Toyota RAV4   -  I proud to drive my Toyota, great car and Great gas milage ! 
Only wish it had more little compartments to put things in ."
"09 18, 2017",Amazing car for the price!,This car is reliable. Great for the price and looks nice. Definitely better than the CR-V in my opinion. It just feels nicer and more sporty.
"09 15, 2017",Very nice for a smaller suv,I think it is perfect for the price. I think they all need a sunroof though! It drove great and the ride was pretty smooth.
"09  9, 2017",Very reliable,"I am a college student and I don't live on campus, I commute. This car is perfect because it does not give me any trouble. I drive about 400-500 miles a week for work and school, so this is it guys, if you are looking for something reliable!"
"09  4, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"I like the styling, gas mileage is okay to good for the class, Toyota reliability.   Drives fine, a slight sport feel."
"09  2, 2017",Love my car!,Traded my 2008 Rav4 limited for a 2015 RAV4 limited. Loved my 2008 and love my 2015. Great comfort and leg room. Fun to drive! Great car.
"08 31, 2017",It's a good car.,"It's similar to Honda CR-V; acceleration was not as good as a compatible CR-V, even though RAV4 has slightly larger engine (2.5L vs. 2.4L)."
"08 27, 2017",Toyota: #1 in our book,"The 2015 RAV  we just replaced with a new RAV was an amazing vehicle.....So was its predecessor , the Matrix,......... we are certain our new RAV will be just as loved.   The way these vehicles handle is great...... you can ""turn on a dime"".   They are super reliable.....good in any weather or road conditions.  They look good and drive even better. ...Unbeatable!"
"08 24, 2017",Most reliable car I ever owned,Eye catching  exterior design.  Very reliable  and have  good gas mileage.  Like the E-tune sound system.
"08 16, 2017",Looks and runs great,"I am an Uber driver, good size back seat and trunk space. Great maneuverable and acceleration.Very good gas mileage."
"08 14, 2017",BRILLIANY!,Great visibility and safety features are awesome. Large back up  view camera. Stylish and comfortable.
"08 14, 2017",Best purchase ever made!!!,I absolutely love my RAV4! I previously owned a 2005 Dodge Neon SXT and loved it but this RAV4 is much more reliable and just my style!!!
"08 12, 2017",Excellent SUV for the money!,"This is my favorite vehicle to drive. It drives and handles like a car. Compared to my 2012 Chevy Sonic, which is a small car, it is very nimble and quick. Brakes are excellent no worries there. Would definitely recommend the All Wheel Drive (AWD) addition, seems to have a little more pep. I love that you can choose your driving type by the push of a button (Economy, Sport). Great Job Toyota!"
"08  8, 2017",Love the handling of this car,Excellent in the winter.  Very easy to park and drive it is very dependable and it is just a great car
"08  6, 2017",Most reliable car I owned,"This car met my needs. Reliability, safety, comfortability, and power expectation are few of the things I love with this car."
"08  1, 2017",Luv my new ride!,"My 2015 RAV4 Ltd ROCKS!  This vehicle is awesome! It is easy to drive and comfortable.  It has  an excellent backup camera, cross traffic warning, AWD, lane departure warning, navigation, blind spot monitoring, blue tooth, and on and on and on.   I traded in my Toyota Highland Hybrid for this SUV and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
"07 31, 2017",Love my new Rav4,"Just bought this car last week so this is  based on a short time frame, but so far I LOVE this car.  Great interior- tons of space and very comfortable.  Not as great of gas mileage as I had anticipated, but I have to drive in traffic every day so that's not unexpected.  Love the body style, love the details inside.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small SUV!  Feels like a huge upgrade from my 1999 Subaru Forester. ;)"
"07 31, 2017","Quality, performance & reliability","I love this AWD SUV, I added a brush guard to mine, it has been flawlessly reliable. 
The one touch seat folding is great, it has a lot of space in the back. 
It's great on gas, comfortable seats, perfect height to see clearly on the road, super easy to park, I love the back up camera with the wide angle lens, the all weather mats are perfect."
"07 30, 2017",Toyota reliability & performance,"This car is an example of value for money without the pricey gimmicks.
Toyota is the most reliable brand I have ever owned and this vehicle has been proved to out perform Honda."
"07 26, 2017",As reliable as American Cars used to be.,This is an excellent car and is extremely reliable and easy to learn how to use all it's features.  I challenge square dance and sometimes travel hundreds of miles to dance.  At least 5 of my dancing friends have RAV4's and they also swear by them!
"07 23, 2017",Love My RAV !,"I simply love this SUV. Decent gas mileage, comfortable, solid construction.  I bought the RAV4 XLE with cargo cross bars, remote rear tailgate, premium stereo with NAV AND REARVIEW camera."
"07 22, 2017",Eyecatching!,Fun to drive.  Sporty-looking.  Comfortable interior with easy access to knobs and controls.  A definite head-turner!
"07 16, 2017",Great reliable crossover,"Decent gas mileage, good leg and head room, good ride and has been reliable so far.  Few squeaks and rattles but not excessive. Would buy again!"
"07 12, 2017",Great car,This car meet all my needs! Had just enough bells and whistles without being too much. Loved the backup camera!
"07  9, 2017",Solid Vehicle,I purchased this vehicle based on my experience with Toyota products. Very reliable.  It also fit my needs of having a usable back seat and room for dogs in the hatch.
"07  6, 2017",2015 Toyota RAV4 LIMITED,"Comfortable, Reliable, safe, Great value, holds 5 passengers and lots of room for things in the back. Good MPG city and road. Air conditioner second to none I ever owned. steering, braking, sure footed.  Excellent re-sale value. Give it a rating of 9 out of 10 on a *soft ride* Navigator is wonderful.  My Toyota dealer is great!"
"07  5, 2017",A smooth ride!,"My husband and I test drove this car, but after some discussion, we decided to buy another car at this dealership. It was a hard choice between this car and a Subaru, but we are happy with our final decision."
"07  5, 2017",Most reliable car I have ever owned ????,"In brief this car met all my family needs, selling it just because I need a bigger car. I loved so much and it's price and mileage such a value compared to the money ??????"
"07  5, 2017",I love it!,"This is a wonderful vehicle!  Good gas mileage and very peppy!  No lag when you step on the gas.  I have the limited with the tech package, so I have the blind spot alert (very nice!) and the lane departure warning.  Back up camera with cross path detection is great also, especially when your backing out of a parking spot in a busy parking lot and you cant see around the vehicles next to you.  I also like that I can turn on the AWD full time when I chose to."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"06 29, 2017",A very sensible care,Very capable car that can get you from point A to point b. It handles well on city streets and on the highways. Plenty of room for hauling moderately sized items; leg room adequate for an above average height person.
"06 29, 2017",RAV 4 is the best Mid SUV investment you can make,"I researched cars for days on end. Looking for the most bang for my buck, since cars cost a lot of bucks. The Honda CR-V is popular and reliable but the drive was too fluffy feeling, not much power or control. The Mazda CX-5 was very impressive, but the RAV 4 just took the prize. It drives exceptionally well for an SUV and looks amazing. The reliability is off the charts and feels so safe to drive. It is by far THE Best Mid Size SUV on the market."
"06 29, 2017",comfortable car and economical driving,"the car price is very reasonable. after almost 2 years driving, the average MPG is 25. It is safe and comfortable vehicle. the space inside is enough for four person, including a car seat. And the storage room is also enough for family use."
"06 18, 2017",I love this car it's confot when you are driving,What I love for this car is  you will not use a lot gas and also is comfort when your driving Toyota is the number one preferred car
"06 16, 2017",I love the roominess in my  SUV,"We love this vehicle, but we do miss a couple things that we feel should have been on this vehicle since it was so expensive. Like on my Mazda 6 it had an alarm and a light come on the side mirrors to alarm you of cars in the other lane. We miss that. And the inside controls like window locks etc. lite up at night."
"06 13, 2017",A Split Decision,"The Wife loves this vehicle. She drives it in town. I don't love this vehicle. I drive it on highways.
We like the roomy, versatile, and comfortable interior. The gas mileage predictions are fairly accurate. It makes it up our steep Minnesota driveway with ease.  Maneuvers into a tricky garage better than others we tried. Styling isn't a big deal to us, but it looks like every other crossover on the road.
The bottom two inches of the inside of the front doors is outside so road slush builds up on them. Stupid and messy. Gas tank only allows a range of about 360 miles. Not enough. No interior storage. Adequate power in flatlands. Gutless in mountains. I have not been able to detect any difference between Sport/Eco modes. There is a problem with the driver seat/ steering wheel relationship. With seat pushed back the ""telescoping"" wheel is too far away (and I have long arms). On snow and ice it likes to obey the laws of inertia and continue in a straight line when you're trying to make it turn. Two years in I'm afraid it's going to last forever. Good thing the Wife likes it."
"06 13, 2017",A beautiful donkey,"I am reading all sort of stuff here about this car.I own a 2013 rav 4 .not comfortable????Are you kidding me?Not fast?Buy a Ferrari...Not stylish?Go get a Pontiac Aztec....Just kidding.
I tell you what.For the price ,the XLE model is the bargain of the century.As for performance is probably the best compromise ever.Buy the 4x4 if you live in a snowy state,buy the xle instead of the le model,and make yourself a favour and get rubber mats.Change the oil and filters as recommended and don t abuse it off road because is not a 4 runner or a highlander.Also,please don t put your stinky feet on the dashboard,don t eat a whole buffet while driving,and don t put your stupid dog on the front passenger seat...Even the rav 4 is not built for that..."
"06 12, 2017",Smooth!,"I was driving a Jeep and got addicted to being up a little off the ground like a regualr car.  Though our Jeep was about the same size, the design is great and lots of leg room for both the front and back seats.  The head room feels great and I love the safety features."
"06  7, 2017",Well worth the price,"This SUV was perfect for me. I could fit my three cocker spaniels in the back seat, the drive was smooth, and it maneuvered easily through main highways. I easily fit in normal parking spaces, the vehicle was excellent when I was in a rear end collision and protected me. My biggest disappointment was that because all the airbags deployed it was a loss."
"06  6, 2017",Much improved from the 2010 model,"REally enjoy driving this car, plenty of room and great gas mileage and plenty of room to carry cargo"
"06  4, 2017",Awsome car i have owend,"This car is perfect that i expected. This car is so comfortable. I recomend some peole who are looking for perfect car buy this car. And, i think it was resonable price for me"
"06  3, 2017",good small car,"good for short drives  wheel base to short  for smooth ridegood gas milage ,not enough cargo space good car for the money"
"06  3, 2017",Very cheap upolstery used on the seats,"I have owned Toyota vehicles for over 20 years, so when I decided to lease a 2015 Rav4, I was optimistic it would not let me down. Within just a couple of months, the drivers seat had a small hole in it. It was at a place where there could be nothing on your clothing, or body, to make a hole. I took my car in for its service to be done and informed the service manager about the issue. After a lot of talking back and forth with Toyota, they finally agreed to replace the cover for the seat, and told me that it was a ""one time deal"". Well, since then, I have had 3 more rears in the upolstery. I have no idea how it has happened, but I can tell you that there is no one that sits where the tears are. I am really disappointed with the quality of fabric Toyota has used for the seats. I am seriously thinking of getting out of my lease early.  Oh, by the way, this car was purchased brand new, with 40 miles on it."
"06  2, 2017",I love it,This car is very comfortable and has a lot more room than i expected. It runs beautifully and is very reliable.
"05 31, 2017",Great car!,"This is my 3rd RAV4. It's a great all-around vehicle. I've had two with the tire on the rear door, and now I have the newly style RAV4."
"05 30, 2017",Great upgrades!,"I bought the limited trim for the RAV4 and all of the upgrades make this vehicle go from good to great! Seat position memory buttons, heated seats, leather interior, extra subwoofer in the back, lane departure alert, upgraded stereo, and more. The vehicle rides very nice and is super reliable."
"05 29, 2017",Paint chipping on 2015 Rav4,"Great vehicle, nice ride, terrific reliability and value. However, small pencil size chips on the hood started showing up after the purchase. Now, two years into the vehicle, at least 15-20 of those chips has appeared. The chips are not because of road debris, but are due to inferior painting processes.  Online research shows many complaints of the same issue. Otherwise, fantastic vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Love this car. Best choice I've made so far,"Love it. Smooth, spacious and comfortable. Love the sunroof and back up camera is a life saver. The interior is beautiful"
"05 21, 2017",Great car!,"Wonderful value and features! This car is beautiful , I love the moon roof! It's very reliable and efficient too"
"05 10, 2017",Leasing a Rav 4 2015,"This is the worst vehicle anyone  can lease or purchase. First when I went to sign the papers and give them a check of 4,000.00 plus 1,600.00 to insure the vehicle of scratches. When I asked to see the vehicle they refused to bring it for me to look at it unless I sign the papers, and they said it was in another lot. They refused to give me a test drive. So it wasn't until I signed the papers when they decided to bring me the vehicle. So when driving the vehicle home I notice that it sounded like a truck it felt like a truck. Did not like the sound of it.  Within that week I had to do alternate side so as I'm waiting in the have the running to keep warm since we're in the month of November I notice the gas gage is moving as if I'm driving the car. I right away took the car back to Toyota and complaint to them about this problem. They apparently check it out they claim there's no problem. It's been a year and 6 months and I'm still having this problem.  I hate this car with a passion."
"05  8, 2017",Good little SUV,i love the reliability of this car. drives really nice for long trips. its very versatile for everyday life. i have two dogs and they fit in the back nicely. if you get this vehicle get a different seat texture...i.e. leather or faux leather...if you have pets.
"05  6, 2017",Rav4 Toyota,"Ok car but I will not buy again
For the money it cost
Lack at comfort  in tow especially 
Should cost less"
"05  4, 2017",Dream Car,"Best vehicle I've ever owned! Beautiful interior, especially the leather touches on the interior Limited. Excellent room in the trunk and nice little touches that make it feel luxurious! Very reliable and will probably last forever!"
"04 30, 2017",The best vechile I ever purchased,"I purchased my RAV 4. This has been the best Toyota vehicle I have bought thus far. I previously purchased a 2010 Camry SLE/XLE.   The RAV 4 is more roomy, stylish, excellent driving in snow & ice. Good gas mileage also"
"04 24, 2017",Rav4 ever,"Great vehicle for the money, would recommend it to anyone, looking for a nice vehicle. A very reliable transport."
"04 24, 2017",My favorite I am on my 5th Toyota,Love the Ravs my 2nd one I have owned it's like running around on skates so very easy to get around in .
"04 22, 2017",Entune system is unreliable,"The performance of the sound system is very good. However, the Entune voice activated navigation function is laughable at times. It works properly about 50% of the time and often can't tell the verbal difference between Arizona and Maine."
"04 12, 2017",Great Vehicle,Me and my wife purchased a 2015 Toyota Rav-4 brand new and absolutely love the vehicle! The styling is sharp and the performance is impressive for a smallish SUV.
"03 30, 2017",Good Car so Far,"I traded in a 2010 Toyota for this 2015 RAV4. I have only had the RAV4 a few days and am very pleased with it thus far. If this Toyota is as reliable as the one I traded, I will be very pleased."
"03 30, 2017",Retired,"Nice looking, comfortable car with many good features.  Easy handling, ease in using the computer with navigational feature.  Plenty of room."
"03 14, 2017",I love this Rav4,This is my 4th Rav and my next one will be a rav I love this suv it handles so nicely it looks great and I love driving  it
"03  6, 2017",Fantastic Rav4,"I've never purchased a new vehicle before, but struck gold with this one. We test drove the new Subaru Forrester, Mazda CX-5, and this one when we were shopping. We intentionally didn't test drive the Honda CR-V since we didn't like the design. 

We were wowed with the comfort and control. We also like the exterior design and interior layout. It's a great vehicle and has been very dependable. We did have to get the wheels re-aligned after 1.5 years of driving, but I know I've hit a bump or two at a fast speed and was not surprised. We love the car and plan to have it for years to come. 

We got the basic package to keep the cost down, but we kind of wish we had the electrical back door and interior lights for the door electronic controls. Can't really see the button to unlock doors when it's dark out."
"03  1, 2017",Very Good but Not Great. Poor Transmission,"Overall this is a good car but Toyota cut corners from the previous 2008-11 generation.  My previous Rav4 was a 2009 AWD. The ride is improved and is quieter than last generation.  A big complaint is the 6-speed transmission. This RAV4 is programmed to always go to 6th gear, even at 45 mph.  That is about 1400 rpm and the engine has LOW torque. Also with 2 people in car at 70 mph on a 2% grade it cannot hold speed in cruise control and harshly downshifts from 6 to 4th gear revving engine to 4000. This occurs on every small grade.  Cruise control also Downshifts on a downhill grade to slow the car and does not upshift  for 5-7 seconds after you reach level ground. Just Wierd !!  The integrated phone and audio system is good. The AWD system is very good and average mileage is 24+ mpg.
This is the LE model but many interior items have been removed from the 2009 BASE model Rav4 to cut costs. Here is a short list:
Only one 12v outlet inside, none in center console and none in rear area
Delay wipers have no adjustment - 1 delay time only
No eyeglass storage in headliner above front seats.
Rear Seats no longer slide fore-aft and on and on.

Toyota also refuses to give an accessible plug for rear lights for trailers.
All Tacoma's and Tundra's have this plug under the bumper.
All interior rear panels on RAV must be removed to install the adapter: cost is $300+
Overall I would not purchase another RAV4."
"01 28, 2017",Great experience from start to finish,Zach was my salesman. He was very knowledgable of all cars on the lot. He helped me make the best decision within my budget and made it clear of what I was getting along the way as far as warranties. I live over 300 miles away and he helped me finish all of the paperwork over the phone. He registered my car with secretary of state and even had my plate on it when he had the car driven 150 miles north to meet me with my car! He went above and beyond throughout the process and I would highly recommend doing business with him.
"01  5, 2017","Not a Lexus, but what a car!","I highly recommend buying a Toyota RAV4 at a Lexus dealership. Great car. Great salesman (Ignacio), and great service."
"12 14, 2016",Great for family,"Economical and Worth the buy.  It saves on gas, handles the road smoothly and has a lot of space.  Beautiful exterior and interior. Makes sure to get the feature back up camera. It helps a lot."
"11 16, 2016",My Dream Car,"My 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD is my dream  car come true, superior Audio System, Reliability unmatched, outstanding exterior style design, AWD, Manual Option gears, optional Daylights, heated Side Driving mirrors, Moon Roof, a strong Roof Carrier with Cross Bars, good Gas Economy,  Roomy interior and Good Visibility- all in one package. However, I doubt the durability of the seats clothing and the dashboard padded cover below the audio screen and wish the GPS Navigation is inclued in the XLE package. Butf for now, I just love my practical RAV 4 like no other."
"09 27, 2016",Rough Ride,"I am very disssapointed with the hard ride of the car.
When it hits a bump or just a sewer cover,  even driving slow, it jars the entire car.  You feel like your are rocking and rolling and vibrates through your body.
Riding on the Belt Parkway recently, by the time i got home to Long Island, I was sick to my stomach from the ride.  Also does not handle well even on parkway, as it seems to wobble.
It also is noisy on the inside of the car when driving.
The voice recognition is not the best.
Very disappointed as I like the style, and setup of the car, but not the ride.  When I brought it in to have service manager drive it, he was in agreement with the hard ride.  Turns out one of the shock absorbers was leaking, but that did not make any difference when it was replaced.
Sorry to say, but this one has to go.\"
"09  3, 2016",Ada's review,"It's a very reliable car with a very smooth ride. The interior could be much better and not happy with the poor crash rating. Gas mileage could be much better, and the navigation system has limits, it won't accept all addresses."
"08 28, 2016",Most reliable crossover on the market,"This car is SUPER reliable. I have had zero issues with this vehicle and expect to drive it for many years to come. I live in the mountains and have taken this car on every terrain imaginable, and it performs every time. The quality on the interior certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but after trading in my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (w 28k miles), I know better than anyone that all the fancy features and comfort in the world do not make up for a mechanically unreliable vehicle. The Jeep was one problem after another, despite having only 28k miles.

In comparison, the Rav4 has needed nothing since the day I drove it off the lot. If some cheap details in the cabin are the worst thing about this SUV, then you know it's a good vehicle. Toyota did not cut corners where it counts with this vehicle (i.e. under the hood). Do NOT buy this car expecting a luxury ride or excellent features--buy this car because you want a vehicle that will get you where you need to go no matter what, and will last you 10+ years with minimal problems. Who cares if people think it's ""boring"" to drive? After my Jeep nightmare, I can tell you that it is WAY more boring to sit at a dealership for hours waiting for repairs!!

 When you start up the Rav you know you will get to your destination no matter what. At the end of the day, that's all I care about. If you're a buyer with similar priorities, you'll love the Rav4"
"08  8, 2016",never buy-- noisy Bluttooth and noisy drive,"unfortunately its not a good car to buy. very noisy drive on freeway and when you use car's Bluetooth on freeway, the other person thinks you car window is down. As per Toyota service manager its a built in technical fault and can not be fixed. 

I will suggest check this issue before buying."
"06 30, 2016",love it,"I purchased my Rav4 used.  I fell in love with it right away.  It handles well, turns great.  The A/C works great.  I wish the mirror adjustments, and the switches for the windows would light up at night.  I also think it is odd that I don't have automatic headlights.  My last car was a 2005 and it had automatic headlights.  That was disappointing. I love it anyway and would buy it again."
"06 18, 2016","good, not great, car","Body has  tight, solid feel to it.  Very easy and comfortable to drive and turning circle is small.  suspension fairly  stiff(l like that) rather than mushy. Very responsive to steering and brakes, really helped me avoid an accident.  Fantastic blind spot sensors and rear cross traffic sensors on Limited and great high beam auto dimmer as well.  Audio unit links pretty well and reliably with Moto-x phone.  Audio system sounds pretty decent on the Limited and has separate bass, mid , treble for each audio input type.  good lumbar support.  good interior room for class. absolutely great/powerful A/C.

cons:  lots of road noise at higher speed.  some areas of interior feel cheap and plasticky.  lots of rattling around the center console in cooler weather-very annoying.  only 3 band eq.  no usb folder browsing-very annoying.  accel just okay, would have been nice to have v6 option like they used to.  other aspects, like no illumination in the door lock controls, no homelink, no lights or reflectors  in the opened doors, etc., give the car a  low-end feel, even in the Limited.  Mileage I guess is about average for class, but gas tank seems really small, so I am refilling very often."
"05 22, 2016",A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"This car performs great but Toyota allows little things to make me think twice about it.
The window and mirror controls does not illuminate in the dark. USB just won't read folders unlike previous models including 2012 camry.
The cruise control is awkwardly placed , have to be looking down all the time.
USB READING FOLDERS IS MY BIGGEST HANGUP.
FIX IT TOYOTA !!!!!!!"
"04 29, 2016",Toyota no more,"Got Toyota due to its reliability ad. My big mistake. Expensive fixes at dealership match my 15 year old BMW expenses, but the frequency of it goes far beyond.
One thing for sure - Toyota advertisement worked."
"03 26, 2016",XLE 2015,"I have Toyota XLE 2015 and other than interior design, I'm really happy with it. It's very good in Gas and very reliable."
"02 14, 2016",Not the best car!,"I owned 4 Toyota cars before - 1 Corolla, 2 Camry, 1 RAV4. This is my 5th Toyota. Over the years Toyota quality has gone down. With this RAV4 2015, the interior is very dark specially in nights. The door lock / unlock, window roll-down lock, and mirror adjustment buttons are not lit. There is NO low-beam indicator on the dashboard. These are standard features in any other car. I asked the dealership to bring this to Toyota's attention. They refused to do it. Very disappointed with Toyota. This is my last one."
"02 12, 2016",Most reliable car I have owend.,I love my 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD I live in Nebraska and it does amazing in the winters here. It is very roomy and has plenty of rom for my grandchildren. I had a 2012 Ford Escape that I traded in because it had quite a few problems it started to jump some times when you hit the gas. I chose the Rav 4 because Toyota is very reliable. I LOVE MY RAV 4
"01 26, 2016",Nicest car I have ever owned,"First time I have ever got a vehicle with all the bells and whistles. Lane assist is amazing, had a neck fusion a few years ago. This helps me so much. I press a button on the steering wheel, a voice asks me what I want? I can change the channel on the radio, get directions, simply amazing."
"01  2, 2016",A quality car at a great price.,"I just purchased a new 2015 Toyota RAV4 and couldn't be more pleased. The car is very roomy for it's class. The car has a very tight + solid feel to it. The car looks great on the outside and the inside. The dash has a nice layout with all the controls within easy reach. I especially like the fact that the all wheel drive system, which is activated when the system detects wheel slippage, can be turned on manually when you are traveling in very slippery conditions provided you don't exceed 25 mph in the manually locked in mode.

I found the Toyota personnel including sales, management, vehicle service and clerical to be very pleasant and helpful. It was a very good buying experience. I highly recommend the RAV4."
"12 20, 2015",dim dashboard lights in the daylight,"I find that the dashboard light are dim in the daylight. When driving wearing sunglasses, I have problems seeing the odometer. I have to ride without wearing sunglasses in order to see how fast I'm going."
"12 16, 2015",Great on gas,So far I am concerned I am very pleased with the Rav 4 Limited. By buying the Limited we received things that we would have to pay for on other Rav 4's. Plenty of leg room both in the front and rear seats. Everything at your fingertips. You never need to take your hands off the wheel. The only thing that I think can be improved on is the size if the window where the radio and traffic is. It is hard to set up the nav trip because it is so small. But I love my Rave 4.
"12 10, 2015",Small Tank Capacity,"First off I'm satisfied with most things on my new 2015 Rav4. However I am very disappointed with the gas tanks fuel capacity. For the last 3 fill ups which I let go down to almost empty, I was only able to get between 46-48 Liters into the tank. I've addressed this issue with the dealer and Toyota Canada and both still think it is my faulty statistics that are wrong. I have documented through receipts and pictures as proof that that's all I'm able to get into the tank. They say continue to monitor. This is totally unacceptable given the specs say I should be able to get close to 60 L in the tank. As a result I'm filling up every week of my city commute. Anyone else having this issue???"
"12  1, 2015",toyota Rav 4,"I was overall impressed with this dealership at Hudiburg Toyota in MWC OK. My sales associate Greg Fanning was smart, honest, and detail oriented with everything that I wanted in my car. If he didn't know the answer than he would find the answer. He worked hard to give me the best price possible. I was very satisfied with the car that I purchased along with the customer service I received at the dealership. I would recommend this place along with Greg Fanning as the representative any day of the week!"
"11 15, 2015",My new RAV4,"My purchasing experience was excellent at Hudiburg Toyota. I just purchase a new car for me. My old 20 years old car broke, and I found a great deal and lots of help with Ralph Jones III.
At the dealership they guide me and advise on the choices that I had and they also informed me about the great benefits in all the options.
I appreciated all the help and the amazing that car that i have now, it is not also time to renovate but also to get something that fits my needs.

I am thankful to Hudiburg Toyota."
"11 14, 2015",Seems OK so far,OK but I would like less use of hard plastics and very low grade carpet. Some interior materials seem cheep. Macanicaly seems OK.
"11  8, 2015",love this car so far,"I just have this car for 2 months and I love it. Driving experience is smooth and comfortable. Rearview camera is very very helpful for parallel parking and backward parking. Well designed steering wheel make it so easy to control the audio system while you are driving-you can adjust everything with you thumb, even answer a call.
I always choose economic gas usage model so I spent almost the same gas money as I did on a Mazda protege before.
The only flaw so far is a little bumpy when you drive on a not-so-smooth surface. That's probably the problem for all SUVs."
"11  6, 2015",uncomfortable,"Front seats are ""NOT"" for bigger people. Drivers seat is too narrow for comfort. I am 6'2 and 230 lbs and made a big mistake buying a 2015 limited. Your right leg will ride on top of side buttress and if you go over 5 miles, you will be feeling it. Can't do anything about it now, just warn others. By the way, I love Toyota's- had a Camry before-wish I still had it. That's life. Oh, yes. if you are going from a regular car to an SUV, remember they are totally different beasts. Ride will be harsher, inside will be louder-think about it wisely."
"11  2, 2015",Perfect balance between luxury and utility,I have had 4 other Rav4's and this is the first Limited. Very nice vehicle with my only complaint being the somewhat narrow bucket seats. Nicely appointed and all the bells and whistles I could have wanted.
"11  2, 2015",NOT ALL IMPROVEMENTS ARE,"WITH 345000 MILES ON MY '99 RAV IT WAS TIME FOR NEW WHEELS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREAT 360 DEGREE WINDOW VISABILITY? THE BACK UP CAM DOES NOT COMPENSATE. INTERIOR - POORLY THOUGHT OUT. THE CUP WELLS SWALLOW THE CUPS. METAL TRIM STRIP IS SUN GLARING. WHY HIDE THE KEY IGNITION. USEFUL STORAGE IS HARD TO FIND / USE. WHY CANNT YOU DIM THE VIDEO SCREEN AT NIGHT (LIKE THE DASH LITES)? THANK GOODNESS THE '99 IS STILL IN THE DRIVEWAY. IT MAY TAKE ME TO 500,000 MILES YET"
"11  1, 2015",First Toyota,"I have had my RAV4 LE for 6 months and love everything about it except the black interior, everything seems to stick to it and it is hard to keep it looking clean. It is fun to drive, I have taken trips in it and it has done great and it is great for running around town in. This is my first Toyota, but it won't be my last."
"10 19, 2015",5K mile review,"So this is my 5th toyota I have owned through almost 19 years of driving. I have the 2015 Rav4 LE AWD model. I now have put on 5k miles through 6 months of ownership. The things I like about the vehicle: toyota reliability and dependability of course, nice acceleration, comfortable big seats, very generous leg room (front and rear), good trunk space, exterior styling, descent gas mileage (I get about 18.5 in the city and about 26 on the hwy.), and I love that it has a 6 speed automatic trans. Instead of the the CVT trans. Like the nissan rogue and honda cr-v. What I don't like about this vehicle: the seat fabric makes it challenging to keep extra clean, I would add a sunglass holder, I would make the front window sun visors to slide out for extra sun protection while driving, I would add a compass on the mirror for the LE model, instead of hub caps I would like alloy wheels, I would like splash guards to come with the vehicle, the Bluetooth does not always work, the doors seem really flimsy, especially the outside door handles, i would like the top of the front windshield to have a bit of tint to block some of the sun while driving, and I would like the front cup holders to be next to each other not a foot apart. This SUV may be a bit vanilla to most, but I take it for what it is: a company that built their good reputation throughout the years by making good quality cars that last a long time. So far no problems for me with this vehicle. I will add a review in years to come as the mileage piles up. Thanks!"
"10  3, 2015",Toyota RAV4: Great for short rides!,"Love my new Rav 4 Limited Edition. The 2 color leather seats are so stylish (Teracotta). So far (2 weeks) so good. However, IF YOU TAKE LONG DRIVES DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CAR. I took it on a LONG drive (5 hours each way) and felt like I was getting off of a horse when I arrived! My toosh was sore! The ""bucket seats"" really hug you -- too much. There's a lumbar support which I turned off to give me some relief. Thankfully I have the Limited edition with power seats which allow the driver to adjust the seats during the ride. Maybe it would be more comfy it you are really petite?
One other negative is that I found the leather seats hot on a long ride on a hot day. My lower back was sweaty! And I had the AC running on high! I'm guessing it's the leather snug seats? (never happened in my Camry LXE w/ leather seats). I love being up high\ which is a plus...This is a Small SUV inside, overall. I happen to like that, but if you're looking for a large SUV this isn't it. I drive this into NYC daily so didn't want a big car but did want to be HIGH up. I feel safe in this car! And the view is great! The front windshield is really wide! I have to get used to not having a trunk like I had in my Camry. I miss it. This has a nice hatch back area with a security shade. The seats in back go down very easily if you needed the room. I'm happy with it overall! We'll drive my husbands big car on long rides!"
"09 30, 2015",unimpressed,disappointed with performance and ride which is 90% of the reason for buying. test drive should have been longer. the more I drive the less I like it. Go for the limited version as the sound system in the xle sucks and no auto. button for the rear door sucks. There is really very little room to store things and even with seats down it fills up fast. Styling is nice and I'm hoping it handles well in the winter weather or I'll probably trade in and take a loss.
"09 26, 2015",Busy Mom,"I am very excited to own my new Toyota Rav4! It is a sporty yet classy vehicle. Previously I owned a Sequoia so I had some concerns with both the much smaller size and engine on the Rav4, however I am not disappointed at all. The Rav4 is more spacious on the inside then it looks on the outside. When I read reviews prior to my purchase others had mentioned problems with pick up and maintaining speed while going up hills. I have not found any of these problems to be true for me. In fact, on the contrary I am delighted with its performance. I frequently have to ramp onto dangerous and busy highways and have not had any concerns at all. I would strongly recommend this vehicle to others without hesitation."
"09 22, 2015",2015 RAV4 XLE,"2015 RAV 4 XLE is a vast improvement over the previous model. Prior to our 2015 we had a 2008 which was a good car but the styling, rear swing open tailgate and 4 speed transmission let it down. Our transmission would hut and violently downshift and upshift when going uphill at 65 MPH. We took it to the dealer for repair 3 times and they had no resolution. The mileage was also poor at 22 combined.
2015 PROS: 6 speed transmission like our 2013 Camry, Swing up lift gate, 28 mpg combined in eco mode, Back up camera. Touch screen, Driving range
CONS: Road noise higher than 2008 and MUCH Higher than in our Camry, Same fuel tank as Camry that shuts off at about 13GL. You can put 2 additional GL in both cars and increase range by 60 miles, Limited cubby/storage areas.
Overall the best choice and value in the category!!"
"09 21, 2015","Cute, but not so comfy","My first biggest complaint is the rock hard seats & uncomfortable road trip on my butt and back.
The engine idles loud.
The brake tends to be hard to keep down and constant pressure that it makes my foot cramp in rush hour traffic.
Lack of suspension, feels like the back end is going to drop out when hitting a small bump in the road or anything that is not a smooth surface.
The seats sit quite low, that I can't put my elbow on the door ledge to relax while driving.
The metal piece on top of dash is blinding when sun hits it, and you cannot read the clock if the sun is coming through the front windshield.
I have yet to get the GPS voice to work with my phone. If my bluetooth is on, I can't even hear the directions coming from my phone.
And I regret not getting power seats and power trunk.
I had a minivan that was 10 years old, that I can describe in two words...luxury ride!
I'm actually looking forward to selling it in about 15-18 months from now. I've already contacted my sales person and he's willing to help me out when that time comes....
I do many day trips, road trips and this car is not cut out for anything longer than a 30 minute drive to and from. I'm disappointed Toyota."
"09 10, 2015",BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN 30 YEARS,"HAD GREAT 2009 RAV4. TRADED IN FOR 2015 RAV
4. CANNOT DRIVE WITH LOW BEAMS AND SEE. LIKE DRIVING INTO BLACK WALL. HAD FOG I
LITES INSTALLED($400) SO COULD SEE ON LOW BEAMS. LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM. TEST DRIV AT NITE OUT OF TOWN AND YOU WONT BUY THIS MODEL. WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BULB CREATING THIS PROBLEM. BACKUP SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN IN SUNLITE, NO LOCKING GLOVE BOX, NO SUNGLASS STORAGE OVER DASH, NO DUAL CONSOLE STORAGE,NO DUAL GLOVE BOX, SMALLER SIDE VIEW MIRRORS. CANNOT COMMENT ON MILAGE AS ONLY HAVE 400 MILES ON IT. CONTACTED TOYOTA ANG GOT BLOWN OFF. VERY POOR CONSUMER RELATIONS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE. BE BETTER OFF WITH A CHEAPER MODEL OR MAKE."
"09  4, 2015",Fantastic SUV.,"Very comfortable with lots of room.

Unbelievable gas mileage, can not wait to drive it in the snow plus we got a super deal. We are very happy
With this vehicle."
"08 31, 2015",Best Car transaction ever,"I love my new car and the expedited ""buying time"" my dealer gave me. Everyone was respectful, listened to us, and answered all our questions. Excellent transaction."
"08 29, 2015",It's a good and reliable vehicle,"This is my second Rav4. Purchased the XLE trim this time. Traded in a 2010 Limited with a V6. Overall I'm happy with the vehicle. The sale price and 0% financing made it a logical choice without breaking the bank. Only reason I traded the 2010 was because it was FWD and I needed AWD.

Pros:
Interior space with back seats down
Eco, Normal and Sport mode choices and good fuel economy
Excellent crash tests and safety results
Relatively quiet ride, good visibility
AWD in the snow
Toyota quality and high residual value

Cons:
Weak lumbar support which can get uncomfortable on long drives
Fabric armrests on doors can show dirt easily
Small capacity fuel tank"
"08 19, 2015",Speedometer inaccuracy,"My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership. An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy. The warranty is 36,000 miles. That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty. Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300. Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer. I went through arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement on July 8, 2015. I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications. In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening. In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.
Otherwise the vehicle operates fine. However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers. I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device. It is definitely underpowered. Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy. Bluetooth doesn't always work. Great for hauling stuff. Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there."
"08 11, 2015",Best driving car I have owned,"I Love my new RAV4, and so do my Grandchildren who are 12 and 11. They like the room and the ease of getting their things out of thee back when we are just going a short distance. They think all the gadgets as they call them are COOL."
"08  7, 2015",best overall exceptional price,"Styling and price beyond comparison in its category and class. Human functionality fluid and above average. I am a large man and find the vehicle to be tight to get in and out of. There also seems to be a great deal of engine and road noise. These 2 factors are minor when considering all amenitys, standard options, and overall drivability of the vehicle. Recommend the Forerunner for anyone over 6'2 or 270 lbs. It was a very good fit. I still greatly enjoy the rav4 though."
"07 30, 2015",Not my best buy,"I traded in an older RAV for a 2015 LE model and I regret having done so. Incredibly the older RAV handled far better and the engine noise was quieter. The LE model doesn't come with fog lights and the black fillers make the vehicle look very tacky. The 2015 RAV acceleration is fair at best and the handling is far from special. Overall the 2015 Rav seems functional but functional is the kindest thing I can call it. It looks and drives like vehicle that should sell for several thousand dollars less. This is my third Toyota Rav and it's also my last one. I would gladly swap it for a competitor's model if I could. Pretty much any competitor. If you're determined to purchase a 2015 Rav, I strongly urge you to at least avoid the entry level LE model. It's somewhat cheaper and the slightly lower price is self evident in the vehicle itself."
"07 20, 2015",BlueTooth System is TERRIBLE!!!,"Bought a new car and the sales experience was incredibly bad- we were basically held hostage and not allowed to leave to eat. After 5 hours and 2 mistakes with the paperwork, we left. The Bluetooth system is very poor and no one can hear me when I call using it on the car. I have had it back to Toyota 3 times and they indicate it is my problem - not the car. this is my 4th new Toyota and will likely be my last as they don't want to fix the problem and most people believe it is the microphone. Buying a new car should be fun and exciting but not this time. I recommend you look to other companies due to the problems with the software and if hands-free is required in your state, this system is horrible."
"07 18, 2015",bought Toyotas for past sixteen years,I trust the Toyota product very happy with my choice. The city here gets a lot of rain and i like the little higher vehicle. Also I am tall and more comfortable getting in and out of this size vehicle. I love the interior all the accessories are easily accessible and right where I am accustomed to. It has a back up camera which I have learned to love for safety. I enjoy the seats folding flat for carrying larger items. The back door makes loading groceries easier and not as much stretch and bending. Appreciate the help with knowing prices thanks.
"07  2, 2015",Best of the three Toyota's I've owned.,"The RAV4 has a great sound system and handles like a dream. I've been to Geargia two times in the safest and most comfortable SUV It handles great, sight line is excellent, smooth transition of the gears good on gas."
"06 22, 2015",A Review of My 2014 Toyota Rav 4,"This comment applies to all Toyotas I have seen, but especially my 2014 Rav 4, which has black fabric seats.

The materials Toyota uses for fabric seats have never been particularly well chosen (from a design, look and feel standpoint).

My 2014 Rav 4 is a really terrific car in all ways but one - it has black fabric seats, and the fabric looks, and feels cheap, and is impossible to keep clean especially from pet hair (even when pets have never set foot in the car). The fabric is far more problematic than the fabrics in my 2012 and 2010 Ravs, although these were not stellar either by any means (just not like Velcro).

Toyota would do well to take a look at the fabrics used to upholster Honda CRV interiors, which look and feel far superior, and which do not function like Velcro for pet hair and similar stuff. It is the one major design flaw in the vehicle (looks like the 2015s are much the same!), and, it's so annoying, my next car my well have to be the Honda CRV instead."
"06 16, 2015",2015 Toyota Rav4 XLE.,"Though overall I like the vehicle, I was disappointed with 3 things that I thought were standard in XLE models (this is not basic model):

1) Does not have auto seat adjust.
2) Does not have lumbar support.
3) Does not have auto headlights.

Drive is very comfortable and could have few additional bells & whistle as blind spot indicator."
"06 11, 2015",First week down and I'm thrilled,"I was looking to replace my minivan with something smaller and more efficient but with large seating areas. I cannot believe how big the rear seat area is, even with the front seats all of the way back. The RAV4 sits higher than the typical economy sedan like a Corolla or Civic, so getting the kids in and out is much easier. This would likely also apply to seniors.
The car also drives very nicely. I cannot believe other reviews mention that it is underpowered. My FWD LE seems to scoot quite well. I also really like how the 6 speed auto transmission always seems to be in the right gear at the right time.
The thing about other makes is that when you get a base model the interior really looks like it. The base level LE RAV4 looks like a quality car from inside and out. The interior is beautiful, but oddly has mabye 5 or 6 different materials and textures. I am averaging 24+ MPG tooling around town so far, but have yet to take a long highway drive to test highway mileage.
I really am impressed with the integrated stereo/bluetooth phone controls/backup camera setup. Again, a base car with top line features. Stereo sound is very good IMO, especially in CD mode.
If you want a car that is small outside but very large and comfortable inside the RAV4 should be considered. For the price paid it can't be beat."
"05  6, 2015",Interior features not as good as our former 2007 R,"Short comings of Interior Design (vs 2007 RAV4)
Some panel light not lit without the lights being on
(requires turning on lights well before needed)
No place to store glasses or sunglasses
(In the 2007 RAV4 there was room for 3 pairs)
Not as many places to store misc small things (1 vs 2)
Console between seats lacks space for storage of
small, flat items, as was present on the 2007 RAV4.
The extra glove compartment of the 2007 RAV4 is now
only a shelf on the dashboard.

Even the 2007 RAV4 lacked storage space for flat materials such as maps, so they will continue to be stuffed between the seat and the center console."
"04 21, 2015",Great car,"I recently bought a 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD , and I love it. The color I picked is Barcelona Red and everyone that sees it thinks its a beautiful color. Does it ride like a luxury SUV? No but still, it rides smoother than a lot of small suv on the road. In short, I would recommend the rav 4 if you are looking for a small SUV with class and at a great price."
"04 13, 2015",Again,I have enjoyed my 14 year old Rav4 so much that I bought another one. Can't beat a good thing. So far so good.
"04 11, 2015","Toyota to the T, not for me","I ended up in a fender bender the other week and needed my vehicle repaired. I drive a 2010 Hyundia Electra. The only reason why I purchased this vehicle is the MPG's as I was driving 84 miles one way to work. When the economy was really bad back in 2011 I was desperate.

Anyway, this is an good vehicle, but sort of disappointed. For all of the hoopla of that Toyota's are exemplary vehicles to drive I just don't get it. They do drive pretty good, nice seating position, seats are decent but nothing to write home about. I had the AWD and experienced OK gas mileage. When I was on the highway I experienced roughly 27-29 MPG which isn't half-bad for AWD. As soon as I get to stop and go traffic I saw my fuel gauge drop. It has enough pep to merge with traffic but not enough to do any inspiring driving.

I guess that's just it. It does well enough on everything but nothing to say ""Wow I can't wait to drive this thing"". It was more or less ""I can't wait to get home"". I mean it's not a bad CUV but I can name a plethora of CUVs that I would look into getting prior to getting this. Maybe the Lexus version is more inspiring I would imagine.

Some months ago I test drove a 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4 cylinder in Louisiana. It was your standard front wheel drive mid range (latitude I believe) and I feel that it was more inspiring to drive this CUV.

The best way to describe it is to compare it to MR or MRS reliable. Their not bad and they get the job done just don't expect anything more."
"04  4, 2015",disappointed,"The seats are uncomfortable, rough ride, rigid frame and every pot hole, or bump in the road sends a jolt to the passenger's. Gas mileage sucks."
"04  1, 2015",Beware of salesman claiming blue tooth capability,"Just bought a new RAv 4- switched from an Altima. Was promised a hands free blue tooth system. Which is true as long as the only thing you want to do is make phone calls similar to the function of an old flip phone. Texting function has no voice recognition so you have to read and select pre-selected messages. When the salesman explained that unless i wanted to upgrade ($8,000.00 ) for the top line model, I would not have GPS on the car. I though fine. My abdroid phone will do that and if I have blue tooth. Im good. But the car will not let the phone do that at least not thru the speakers. I either have to spend time reprograming the system everytime I want to use a map app (not something that is hands free and I have to stop the car) or unpair the phone and not be able to get phone calls thru bluetooth. They suggested I should buy a new phone. Verizon guys assumed the car was before 2008--the programing was so simple (AND CHEAP FOR TOYOTA) also that a new phone would not fix the programing in the car. And every time you turn the car off it goes back to the default setting that plays all my ringtones like a playlist and then has map lady in background talking softly. The volume control needs to be VERY LOUD for the map app and will blast you on all other audio.

Also mileage is not as listed best is 27 not 31 mpg (with coasting down all hills and reduced speed. and worst is 18 not 22."
"03 29, 2015",NIce Car,Would recommend this vehicle for anyone driving a lot of miles but needs some space.Great for getting around in traffic or crowed parking lots.
"03 23, 2015",NEW 2015 RAV4 XLE,"Just replaced a 2014 RAV4 XLE that was totaled in an accident with a 2015 RAV4 XLE. Only difference was color change from Shoreline Blue Pearl to Super White. Great little CUV, no issues with year old unit in the 10k miles of ownership. This is my 10th Toyota and all have performed excellently. Strongest resale value of any small SUVs."
"03 15, 2015",Most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"Purchased 2015 Toyota RAV4
Pros - All wheel drive is excellent for our snowy Wisconsin winters
Cons ?Installing a very stiff suspension system to make it seem like it has sportier handling has produced an extremely harsh, rough ride with even the littles bumps creating a sharp jolt to the passengers.
--Toyota also decided to sacrifice driver comfort for anyone over 6? by:
1- Not allowing the seat to move back far enough and the driver to decide how much room to leave for the back seat passenger even though there is a lot of extra room behind it when no one is in the back seat. This keeps a taller persons knees against the dash and the cruise control to hit your leg.
2 -Only way to sit is with seat in reclining position making it impossible to maintain correct posture and avoid back problems.
3-Jamming the seat belt receiver clip below the seat bottom as well as being sandwiched tightly between the seat and center counsel rather than having it project above the seat so it can be used.
4-Unusable sun visor is recessed into the ceiling without any wide spot in the ceiling to grab and lower it.
5-Slush and salt builds up on inside bottom of the doors in winter driving regions. This increases rusting possibilities and falls off in the garage or on a person?s lower legs as you exit the vehicle.
6 -Difficult entry for tall person due to sharp sloping roof line.
7-Ridges on top of front fenders make it impossible to judge where outside edges of front fenders are. Terrible to park and drive in town."
"02 20, 2015",Well designed reliable nimble and sharp to look at,"We bought the Toyota based on the extreme reliability we enjoyed with our previous 2009 Toyota Camry. The Camry was driven 165000 miles including severe winter weather with salt and snow covered roads common to Vermont. When we traded the Camry it still looked and drove great. It was on its second set of brake pads. The original set was replaced at 110000 miles. The rotors were fine. The only repair item needed was a water pump at 125000 miles. We always used synthetic oil. The engine stayed clean and ran like new.

If the Rav 4 is as reliable as the Camry we will be happy.
We went with the Rav 4 because of the extra cargo capacity and all wheel drive. It's s very comfortable car to drive on the highway. Gas milage is around 25-27 mpg so far. Six speed transmission is smooth and is always in the right gear for each driving condition. We especially like the push button keyless ignition that came with the limited edition."
"02  2, 2015",smaller,I aqm pleased with the new Rav4. I have some problems with the location of controls such as cruise control. Lots of whistle and gadgets to distract a driver. Communication with the sales person after the sale has been a problem. Part of the deal was a trailer hitch. We purchased the vehicle on 6 Jan 2015. the hitch still needs a wiring harness. Way to long to complete the installation.
"01 28, 2015",Stylish and fun,"I love the style, the interior, backup camera, navigation system, sound system, handlingPlus there is a lot of room inside and in the back,. The only thing missing I wished that it had is where you can program it for your garage door opener. If it has that I haven't found it yet."
"01 25, 2015",great car,Love every thing abou this car except hard to understand how to set up the radio etc . Speaker blue tooth is dificult for people to understand me.
"01 10, 2015",not a bad ride...,"I do not agree with the writer that was comparing his V6 limited Rav4 with this one... its like comparing the old style Rav4 with the 4 cylinder with the V6 model... two totally different vehicles.. MOST people that are buying a smaller SUV are buying it to get them higher off the ground than a sedan, easier access to and better storage and the availability of 4 wheel drive... I had a V6 Rav4 as well, and it was way too powerful for that size of a vehicle... I now have a 2013 Rav4 and its great at doing what it was made for... I lug two 16 year old boys to away hockey tournaments all the time in it, with two adults in the front... and the dashboard is perfectly placed, simple to use and works well... I'm 6'3"", 240 lbs and I have no problem getting in or out of this vehicle and quite comfortable in it for long drives... I will say that the 2009 Rav4 I had, was of a bit better quality (plastics, etc) but for what I paid, I like this mid size SUV..."
"01  8, 2015",Poorest suv i've ever had,Wish i had not bought this RAV4...i have bought the Honda CR-V and is perfection...this is a poor design SUV and with the poorest client service
"12  7, 2014",Not recommended,It is just a nice try. 4 cylinder engine is not performing at all. Currently I have a 2012 V6 limited and I am extremely happy with the car. I test drive one 2015 4 Cylinder fully loaded one. It was a big frustration new RAV4 is NOT performing on the road at all. If you like to have a car can deal with the winter conditions like me I suggest to think twice to buy new RAV4
"11 14, 2014","nice car ,toyota brakes","first Toyota I've owned-roomy inside, great view of road. braking is only thing I don't like- car feels like it accelerates when you are braking. Specialist checked and stated this is normal for a Toyota, says it is safe-just feels a bit unnerving to have car ""accelerate"" when you are braking. wish breaking was smoother."
"11 10, 2014",Smart and Stylish Reliable Car,"The car as beautifuly stylish as smart. Considering that's a pretty big car I highly recommend to buy TechPackage if you want to save time, nerves and skip guessing (especially going back).
Depending on your road conditions you can choose Sport, Eco (economical) or normal Drive Mode. Most time I use Eco Mode because like I said that's a pretty big car!.
One more benefit - Moon Roof: you may add some fresh air with less noise and polution from a road. And there is plenty of room for 5 people. I LOVE MY NEW CAR !"
"11  1, 2014",Best deal in town,"Received the best deal in town at Hendrick Toyota of Merriam kansas. Worked with me to make sure I was completely satisfied with my deal. Pleasant & friendly. Would recomend you purchase your next car. I worked with Jennifer Vinson, Jeff Breaux and Robert Biehl."
"10 26, 2014",Wonderful car,"My new 2015 RAV4 Limited replaces my 2004 RAV4 Limited. The new car is much bigger than the old one. It is nearly as big as my 2005 Highlander. The car rides firmly but comfortably. The engine power could be stronger but it is adequate. The navigation system has made several minor errors but no system is 100% accurate. I've been averaging about 24 mpg for combined local and highway driving. The back-up camera with cross traffic alert, the blind spot monitors and the lane departure alert are very welcome and useful features. The JBL sound system is excellent. There is plenty of storage space in the cabin, but I miss the small draw in the dash of my old RAV4 that I used to hold coins for parking meters. The placement of the vanity mirror light in the ceiling rather than on the visor provides better lighting. I also like the power lift gate. It is much more convenient than the old horizontally opening door with the spare mounted on it. The spare is now out of the way under the floor of back cargo area."
"12  5, 2017","Best most reliable car I've ever,ever owned!!","Where do I start it has everything I need such as all wheel drive when I need it , roomy for the family nice big back to put many things comfortable in the back!!! It's a Toyota need I say too much more, they are reliable for the long haul and that's what you want when you work hard for your living!!! I've had Toyotas in the past and they have gone and gone beautifully!!! This RAV4 suites and meets my every need and Toyota is where I'm staying all the way always!!!!!!  Sooooooo Happy!!!!!!"
"12  2, 2017",Greatest car I?ve ever owned,"This car is amazing! I went from a small 2004 Toyota Camry to this 2015 Toyota RAV4. And I?m not disappointed! I have enough room for the whole family, including the dogs. We are able to tow our jet ski with it which was a must have for me. It is easy to drive and park (I suck at pulling into parking spots if there?s people on either side because I get nervous) so it?s been great for me. The touch screen radio and backup camera are great. The backup comes in handy when needing to hook up the jet ski. My fiancee and I even took this car deer hunting and it drove through gravel and fields just fine. The gas mileage was great while making the five hour drive home from when we picked it up. I believe it was around 34mpg. My fiancee is also a mechanic, so he will NOT let me buy any sort or motorized equipment without him thoroughly looking it over. The RAV4 got his approval right away. He said it was safe and reliable and that we will be able to drive this car for another 15-20 years. Very happy that this is the car we went with as I wanted a Jeep. Glad my fiancee and family talked me out of it."
"12  1, 2017",Great Car,"Performs as well as any car I have ever owned including sports cars.  Great performance either in city or highway.  enjoy the styling, comfort and accessories.  This car has it all."
"11 28, 2017",Excellent handling and comfort,"2015 Toyota RAV4 handles well and offers a smooth ride. I just traded up from 2009 Rav4, which had more storage and hiding spaces. I really prefer the side hinged door to the upper lift"
"11 26, 2017",Good so far,"I just bought this vehicle a couple weeks ago, it works very well so far. Although, a message popped up saying it needed maintenance, that?s an easy fix, I hope."
"11 26, 2017",The most reliable car I?ve ever owned,The reason I bought this car was because of it?s performance and reliability I like the exterior styling and the comfortable interior design
"11 22, 2017",Amazing size as style,I love the ease of driving it. It's a safe and reliable car on the road and has a nice and roomy interior.
"11 21, 2017",Vehicle Review,"Safe, wonderful family vehicle. Love the navigation and features that this vehicle has. I needed something that would help me feel safe on long trips back East to see family"
"11 20, 2017",Great suv strongly recommend to anyone great on ga,Comfy stylish roomy radio speakers good bluetooth..has crusise control nice car for the price ..nice
"11 10, 2017",So far so good!,"Reliable!!!  Looks nice.  Love the all wheel drive!  Roomy with lots of space!  Love the back up scree
N"
"11  9, 2017",Wonderful car!,"All Toyota are great cars, but the Rav4 is perfect for me. I work about 40 minutes away from home so, I am on the road a lot. I feel very safe in my Rav. Having a compact SUV is nice because you have a lot of room inside without feeling like you are driving a spaceship."
"11  6, 2017","Love Toyota?s anyway, but this car drives so nice.","Drive 3 teens to school each day with 3 big backpacks, fits everyone and everything great. Rains a lot in this state and I feel very safe in it,. Love the backup camera also."
"11  3, 2017",My Car,"I purchased this from a dealer. Owned it for a year and drove all type of roads. I could transport the items that i thought it won't fit. No regrets in having this car. 

Amazing Car !"
"11  2, 2017",Reliable car,"This car was a great AWD vehicle. I enjoyed driving it.Very comfortable. The gas tank is a little smaller than most cars but avg MPG was around 24-26. I've been told the Bluetooth sound while calling others had a ""tinny"" sound."
"10 25, 2017",Great Vehicle,This car meets all of my needs as of now. Of course I would have liked to have climate control and moon roof but those are not necessities. Its spacious enough for a family of four and everyone loves it. The mileage could improve a little but I think its still much better than other SUVs in the market.
"10 21, 2017",Great Car,"As a previous owner, we were delighted to test drive this vehicle.  In fact, we bought it.  An upgrade for us include rear camera.  We are so excited!"
"10 19, 2017",A great car at a good price,This is a great car for the working man or women. Although its small in size it has plenty of room for a big guy.  Love the back up camera and blue tooth.  you will be amazed at the performance and turning radius of this Toyota RV 4.
"10 17, 2017",Needed something with a little more space.,This car appears to be large enough to meet my needs.  More space for my golf equipment and dog kennel.
"10 15, 2017",Great car for it's value! Very fun!,This car is great for it's value! Very fun to go off road in road trips. Pretty spacious and comfortable and the cargo size is neat too. Couple of people complained about the performance. Of course this is not a performance heavy vehicle but I had no problems with it during the snow and going a bit off road.
"10  7, 2017",Toyota Rav4 Totally Reliable,"The car is roomy, comfortable, mechanically reliable, good on gas.  It  short coming for me are storage related. The arm rest moves when you lean on it, and there are no innovative storage locations like you'd find in a Jeep Cherokee Latitude under the seat or in the rear of the SUV."
"10  5, 2017",Descent Car with a few flaws,"The 2015 Toyota Rav 4 is a reliable car, but does have some flaws that I believe Toyota could've done better with. First lets start off with the Steering. Sensitivity of the steering  is just outrageous. It is too sensitive to a point where changing lanes could easily make you side-swipe another vehicle. Then comes road noise. I believe more sound dampening materials could've been added to the vehicle to block more noise. Other than that, this is a great reliable vehicle."
"10  2, 2017",It?s the perfect suv for the family,"The RAV4 is good SUV very Reliable, Spacious, very good torque and power for Four-cylinder engine more than you need for your family SUV. Value for the money is great. The only think I don?t like about it is when you drive on the highway the car is loud it?s not Isolated perfectly so there is always a wend sound on the highway and the engine is loud too.Stability is perfect and visibility is one of the best on the market for the category."
"10  1, 2017","Very reliable, and great on gas","This car is very reliable. THe interior is very spacious, and when the back seats are lowered, it hauls almost anything.  The gas mileage surprised me for an all wheel drive vehicle.  When we put winter tires on it, It became a tank in the winter.  It pushes through the snow better than my truck.  Great all around vehicle.  I Love it."
"10  1, 2017",Love my 2015 RAV4!!! (Later Release),"This car has way better MPG than advertised. Also, looks very nice and it?s is quite comfortable. I took it off the road and it was a beast. Great car for the money you pay!"
"09 27, 2017","Great Deal, Seamless Purchasing Process","After reviewing competitive pricing online for Toyota RAV4's for cost perspective, we visited this dealer with our wish list and were immediately taken to a spotless 2015 RAV4 with unbelievably low mileage.  We would describe the car as ""barely driven"".
Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.   
What we thought would be a stressful search for a ""new"" car turned out to be anything but stressful. 
Steve Skolnick, our salesman, was happy and we were happy after a short transaction.  
We love the car and our pleasant sales experience!"
"09 26, 2017",Loving my RAV4 2015,"RAV4 does not need a review because it is prooved to be one of the best vehicles within 30K.  Very comfortable from the first ride.  I had a chance to drive 2017 and 2015.  I chose 2015 as a better value.  I like bigger side mirrors so you could see a few lanes around.  I almost do not need to use rear mirror.  In 2017 they messed with side mirrors, they are smaller, but 2017 has new fixtures like brake assist and cruise control assist.  It is really something to consider"
"09 26, 2017",Most reliable with style and compfort,"This car gives all u need in your car like style size and sefty mileage looks reliablety with confidence,and wourth of investment"
"09 25, 2017",Most practical and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is great on gas, reliable in the winter and comfortable for taking long trips. It is also practical for all kinds of activities since it has a roof rack and plenty of space in the back. It is stylish and compact so it is a great transition for those used to driving smaller cars."
"09 23, 2017",About my RAV4,Very nice SUV for the $ but get the 4WD instead of 2WD if you use it in snow prone winters.  Mine didn't make it up the hill to my house 1 night and cost me a tow to get home
"09 19, 2017",1st new car owned and love it,"So happy with my Toyota RAV4   -  I proud to drive my Toyota, great car and Great gas milage ! 
Only wish it had more little compartments to put things in ."
"09 18, 2017",Amazing car for the price!,This car is reliable. Great for the price and looks nice. Definitely better than the CR-V in my opinion. It just feels nicer and more sporty.
"09 15, 2017",Very nice for a smaller suv,I think it is perfect for the price. I think they all need a sunroof though! It drove great and the ride was pretty smooth.
"09  9, 2017",Very reliable,"I am a college student and I don't live on campus, I commute. This car is perfect because it does not give me any trouble. I drive about 400-500 miles a week for work and school, so this is it guys, if you are looking for something reliable!"
"09  4, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"I like the styling, gas mileage is okay to good for the class, Toyota reliability.   Drives fine, a slight sport feel."
"09  2, 2017",Love my car!,Traded my 2008 Rav4 limited for a 2015 RAV4 limited. Loved my 2008 and love my 2015. Great comfort and leg room. Fun to drive! Great car.
"08 31, 2017",It's a good car.,"It's similar to Honda CR-V; acceleration was not as good as a compatible CR-V, even though RAV4 has slightly larger engine (2.5L vs. 2.4L)."
"08 27, 2017",Toyota: #1 in our book,"The 2015 RAV  we just replaced with a new RAV was an amazing vehicle.....So was its predecessor , the Matrix,......... we are certain our new RAV will be just as loved.   The way these vehicles handle is great...... you can ""turn on a dime"".   They are super reliable.....good in any weather or road conditions.  They look good and drive even better. ...Unbeatable!"
"08 24, 2017",Most reliable car I ever owned,Eye catching  exterior design.  Very reliable  and have  good gas mileage.  Like the E-tune sound system.
"08 16, 2017",Looks and runs great,"I am an Uber driver, good size back seat and trunk space. Great maneuverable and acceleration.Very good gas mileage."
"08 14, 2017",BRILLIANY!,Great visibility and safety features are awesome. Large back up  view camera. Stylish and comfortable.
"08 14, 2017",Best purchase ever made!!!,I absolutely love my RAV4! I previously owned a 2005 Dodge Neon SXT and loved it but this RAV4 is much more reliable and just my style!!!
"08 12, 2017",Excellent SUV for the money!,"This is my favorite vehicle to drive. It drives and handles like a car. Compared to my 2012 Chevy Sonic, which is a small car, it is very nimble and quick. Brakes are excellent no worries there. Would definitely recommend the All Wheel Drive (AWD) addition, seems to have a little more pep. I love that you can choose your driving type by the push of a button (Economy, Sport). Great Job Toyota!"
"08  8, 2017",Love the handling of this car,Excellent in the winter.  Very easy to park and drive it is very dependable and it is just a great car
"08  6, 2017",Most reliable car I owned,"This car met my needs. Reliability, safety, comfortability, and power expectation are few of the things I love with this car."
"08  1, 2017",Luv my new ride!,"My 2015 RAV4 Ltd ROCKS!  This vehicle is awesome! It is easy to drive and comfortable.  It has  an excellent backup camera, cross traffic warning, AWD, lane departure warning, navigation, blind spot monitoring, blue tooth, and on and on and on.   I traded in my Toyota Highland Hybrid for this SUV and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
"07 31, 2017",Love my new Rav4,"Just bought this car last week so this is  based on a short time frame, but so far I LOVE this car.  Great interior- tons of space and very comfortable.  Not as great of gas mileage as I had anticipated, but I have to drive in traffic every day so that's not unexpected.  Love the body style, love the details inside.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small SUV!  Feels like a huge upgrade from my 1999 Subaru Forester. ;)"
"07 31, 2017","Quality, performance & reliability","I love this AWD SUV, I added a brush guard to mine, it has been flawlessly reliable. 
The one touch seat folding is great, it has a lot of space in the back. 
It's great on gas, comfortable seats, perfect height to see clearly on the road, super easy to park, I love the back up camera with the wide angle lens, the all weather mats are perfect."
"07 30, 2017",Toyota reliability & performance,"This car is an example of value for money without the pricey gimmicks.
Toyota is the most reliable brand I have ever owned and this vehicle has been proved to out perform Honda."
"07 26, 2017",As reliable as American Cars used to be.,This is an excellent car and is extremely reliable and easy to learn how to use all it's features.  I challenge square dance and sometimes travel hundreds of miles to dance.  At least 5 of my dancing friends have RAV4's and they also swear by them!
"07 23, 2017",Love My RAV !,"I simply love this SUV. Decent gas mileage, comfortable, solid construction.  I bought the RAV4 XLE with cargo cross bars, remote rear tailgate, premium stereo with NAV AND REARVIEW camera."
"07 22, 2017",Eyecatching!,Fun to drive.  Sporty-looking.  Comfortable interior with easy access to knobs and controls.  A definite head-turner!
"07 16, 2017",Great reliable crossover,"Decent gas mileage, good leg and head room, good ride and has been reliable so far.  Few squeaks and rattles but not excessive. Would buy again!"
"07 12, 2017",Great car,This car meet all my needs! Had just enough bells and whistles without being too much. Loved the backup camera!
"07  9, 2017",Solid Vehicle,I purchased this vehicle based on my experience with Toyota products. Very reliable.  It also fit my needs of having a usable back seat and room for dogs in the hatch.
"07  6, 2017",2015 Toyota RAV4 LIMITED,"Comfortable, Reliable, safe, Great value, holds 5 passengers and lots of room for things in the back. Good MPG city and road. Air conditioner second to none I ever owned. steering, braking, sure footed.  Excellent re-sale value. Give it a rating of 9 out of 10 on a *soft ride* Navigator is wonderful.  My Toyota dealer is great!"
"07  5, 2017",A smooth ride!,"My husband and I test drove this car, but after some discussion, we decided to buy another car at this dealership. It was a hard choice between this car and a Subaru, but we are happy with our final decision."
"07  5, 2017",Most reliable car I have ever owned ????,"In brief this car met all my family needs, selling it just because I need a bigger car. I loved so much and it's price and mileage such a value compared to the money ??????"
"07  5, 2017",I love it!,"This is a wonderful vehicle!  Good gas mileage and very peppy!  No lag when you step on the gas.  I have the limited with the tech package, so I have the blind spot alert (very nice!) and the lane departure warning.  Back up camera with cross path detection is great also, especially when your backing out of a parking spot in a busy parking lot and you cant see around the vehicles next to you.  I also like that I can turn on the AWD full time when I chose to."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"06 29, 2017",A very sensible care,Very capable car that can get you from point A to point b. It handles well on city streets and on the highways. Plenty of room for hauling moderately sized items; leg room adequate for an above average height person.
"06 29, 2017",RAV 4 is the best Mid SUV investment you can make,"I researched cars for days on end. Looking for the most bang for my buck, since cars cost a lot of bucks. The Honda CR-V is popular and reliable but the drive was too fluffy feeling, not much power or control. The Mazda CX-5 was very impressive, but the RAV 4 just took the prize. It drives exceptionally well for an SUV and looks amazing. The reliability is off the charts and feels so safe to drive. It is by far THE Best Mid Size SUV on the market."
"06 29, 2017",comfortable car and economical driving,"the car price is very reasonable. after almost 2 years driving, the average MPG is 25. It is safe and comfortable vehicle. the space inside is enough for four person, including a car seat. And the storage room is also enough for family use."
"06 18, 2017",I love this car it's confot when you are driving,What I love for this car is  you will not use a lot gas and also is comfort when your driving Toyota is the number one preferred car
"06 16, 2017",I love the roominess in my  SUV,"We love this vehicle, but we do miss a couple things that we feel should have been on this vehicle since it was so expensive. Like on my Mazda 6 it had an alarm and a light come on the side mirrors to alarm you of cars in the other lane. We miss that. And the inside controls like window locks etc. lite up at night."
"06 13, 2017",A Split Decision,"The Wife loves this vehicle. She drives it in town. I don't love this vehicle. I drive it on highways.
We like the roomy, versatile, and comfortable interior. The gas mileage predictions are fairly accurate. It makes it up our steep Minnesota driveway with ease.  Maneuvers into a tricky garage better than others we tried. Styling isn't a big deal to us, but it looks like every other crossover on the road.
The bottom two inches of the inside of the front doors is outside so road slush builds up on them. Stupid and messy. Gas tank only allows a range of about 360 miles. Not enough. No interior storage. Adequate power in flatlands. Gutless in mountains. I have not been able to detect any difference between Sport/Eco modes. There is a problem with the driver seat/ steering wheel relationship. With seat pushed back the ""telescoping"" wheel is too far away (and I have long arms). On snow and ice it likes to obey the laws of inertia and continue in a straight line when you're trying to make it turn. Two years in I'm afraid it's going to last forever. Good thing the Wife likes it."
"06 13, 2017",A beautiful donkey,"I am reading all sort of stuff here about this car.I own a 2013 rav 4 .not comfortable????Are you kidding me?Not fast?Buy a Ferrari...Not stylish?Go get a Pontiac Aztec....Just kidding.
I tell you what.For the price ,the XLE model is the bargain of the century.As for performance is probably the best compromise ever.Buy the 4x4 if you live in a snowy state,buy the xle instead of the le model,and make yourself a favour and get rubber mats.Change the oil and filters as recommended and don t abuse it off road because is not a 4 runner or a highlander.Also,please don t put your stinky feet on the dashboard,don t eat a whole buffet while driving,and don t put your stupid dog on the front passenger seat...Even the rav 4 is not built for that..."
"06 12, 2017",Smooth!,"I was driving a Jeep and got addicted to being up a little off the ground like a regualr car.  Though our Jeep was about the same size, the design is great and lots of leg room for both the front and back seats.  The head room feels great and I love the safety features."
"06  7, 2017",Well worth the price,"This SUV was perfect for me. I could fit my three cocker spaniels in the back seat, the drive was smooth, and it maneuvered easily through main highways. I easily fit in normal parking spaces, the vehicle was excellent when I was in a rear end collision and protected me. My biggest disappointment was that because all the airbags deployed it was a loss."
"06  6, 2017",Much improved from the 2010 model,"REally enjoy driving this car, plenty of room and great gas mileage and plenty of room to carry cargo"
"06  4, 2017",Awsome car i have owend,"This car is perfect that i expected. This car is so comfortable. I recomend some peole who are looking for perfect car buy this car. And, i think it was resonable price for me"
"06  3, 2017",good small car,"good for short drives  wheel base to short  for smooth ridegood gas milage ,not enough cargo space good car for the money"
"06  3, 2017",Very cheap upolstery used on the seats,"I have owned Toyota vehicles for over 20 years, so when I decided to lease a 2015 Rav4, I was optimistic it would not let me down. Within just a couple of months, the drivers seat had a small hole in it. It was at a place where there could be nothing on your clothing, or body, to make a hole. I took my car in for its service to be done and informed the service manager about the issue. After a lot of talking back and forth with Toyota, they finally agreed to replace the cover for the seat, and told me that it was a ""one time deal"". Well, since then, I have had 3 more rears in the upolstery. I have no idea how it has happened, but I can tell you that there is no one that sits where the tears are. I am really disappointed with the quality of fabric Toyota has used for the seats. I am seriously thinking of getting out of my lease early.  Oh, by the way, this car was purchased brand new, with 40 miles on it."
"06  2, 2017",I love it,This car is very comfortable and has a lot more room than i expected. It runs beautifully and is very reliable.
"05 31, 2017",Great car!,"This is my 3rd RAV4. It's a great all-around vehicle. I've had two with the tire on the rear door, and now I have the newly style RAV4."
"05 30, 2017",Great upgrades!,"I bought the limited trim for the RAV4 and all of the upgrades make this vehicle go from good to great! Seat position memory buttons, heated seats, leather interior, extra subwoofer in the back, lane departure alert, upgraded stereo, and more. The vehicle rides very nice and is super reliable."
"05 29, 2017",Paint chipping on 2015 Rav4,"Great vehicle, nice ride, terrific reliability and value. However, small pencil size chips on the hood started showing up after the purchase. Now, two years into the vehicle, at least 15-20 of those chips has appeared. The chips are not because of road debris, but are due to inferior painting processes.  Online research shows many complaints of the same issue. Otherwise, fantastic vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Love this car. Best choice I've made so far,"Love it. Smooth, spacious and comfortable. Love the sunroof and back up camera is a life saver. The interior is beautiful"
"05 21, 2017",Great car!,"Wonderful value and features! This car is beautiful , I love the moon roof! It's very reliable and efficient too"
"05 10, 2017",Leasing a Rav 4 2015,"This is the worst vehicle anyone  can lease or purchase. First when I went to sign the papers and give them a check of 4,000.00 plus 1,600.00 to insure the vehicle of scratches. When I asked to see the vehicle they refused to bring it for me to look at it unless I sign the papers, and they said it was in another lot. They refused to give me a test drive. So it wasn't until I signed the papers when they decided to bring me the vehicle. So when driving the vehicle home I notice that it sounded like a truck it felt like a truck. Did not like the sound of it.  Within that week I had to do alternate side so as I'm waiting in the have the running to keep warm since we're in the month of November I notice the gas gage is moving as if I'm driving the car. I right away took the car back to Toyota and complaint to them about this problem. They apparently check it out they claim there's no problem. It's been a year and 6 months and I'm still having this problem.  I hate this car with a passion."
"05  8, 2017",Good little SUV,i love the reliability of this car. drives really nice for long trips. its very versatile for everyday life. i have two dogs and they fit in the back nicely. if you get this vehicle get a different seat texture...i.e. leather or faux leather...if you have pets.
"05  6, 2017",Rav4 Toyota,"Ok car but I will not buy again
For the money it cost
Lack at comfort  in tow especially 
Should cost less"
"05  4, 2017",Dream Car,"Best vehicle I've ever owned! Beautiful interior, especially the leather touches on the interior Limited. Excellent room in the trunk and nice little touches that make it feel luxurious! Very reliable and will probably last forever!"
"04 30, 2017",The best vechile I ever purchased,"I purchased my RAV 4. This has been the best Toyota vehicle I have bought thus far. I previously purchased a 2010 Camry SLE/XLE.   The RAV 4 is more roomy, stylish, excellent driving in snow & ice. Good gas mileage also"
"04 24, 2017",Rav4 ever,"Great vehicle for the money, would recommend it to anyone, looking for a nice vehicle. A very reliable transport."
"04 24, 2017",My favorite I am on my 5th Toyota,Love the Ravs my 2nd one I have owned it's like running around on skates so very easy to get around in .
"04 22, 2017",Entune system is unreliable,"The performance of the sound system is very good. However, the Entune voice activated navigation function is laughable at times. It works properly about 50% of the time and often can't tell the verbal difference between Arizona and Maine."
"04 12, 2017",Great Vehicle,Me and my wife purchased a 2015 Toyota Rav-4 brand new and absolutely love the vehicle! The styling is sharp and the performance is impressive for a smallish SUV.
"03 30, 2017",Good Car so Far,"I traded in a 2010 Toyota for this 2015 RAV4. I have only had the RAV4 a few days and am very pleased with it thus far. If this Toyota is as reliable as the one I traded, I will be very pleased."
"03 30, 2017",Retired,"Nice looking, comfortable car with many good features.  Easy handling, ease in using the computer with navigational feature.  Plenty of room."
"03 14, 2017",I love this Rav4,This is my 4th Rav and my next one will be a rav I love this suv it handles so nicely it looks great and I love driving  it
"03  6, 2017",Fantastic Rav4,"I've never purchased a new vehicle before, but struck gold with this one. We test drove the new Subaru Forrester, Mazda CX-5, and this one when we were shopping. We intentionally didn't test drive the Honda CR-V since we didn't like the design. 

We were wowed with the comfort and control. We also like the exterior design and interior layout. It's a great vehicle and has been very dependable. We did have to get the wheels re-aligned after 1.5 years of driving, but I know I've hit a bump or two at a fast speed and was not surprised. We love the car and plan to have it for years to come. 

We got the basic package to keep the cost down, but we kind of wish we had the electrical back door and interior lights for the door electronic controls. Can't really see the button to unlock doors when it's dark out."
"03  1, 2017",Very Good but Not Great. Poor Transmission,"Overall this is a good car but Toyota cut corners from the previous 2008-11 generation.  My previous Rav4 was a 2009 AWD. The ride is improved and is quieter than last generation.  A big complaint is the 6-speed transmission. This RAV4 is programmed to always go to 6th gear, even at 45 mph.  That is about 1400 rpm and the engine has LOW torque. Also with 2 people in car at 70 mph on a 2% grade it cannot hold speed in cruise control and harshly downshifts from 6 to 4th gear revving engine to 4000. This occurs on every small grade.  Cruise control also Downshifts on a downhill grade to slow the car and does not upshift  for 5-7 seconds after you reach level ground. Just Wierd !!  The integrated phone and audio system is good. The AWD system is very good and average mileage is 24+ mpg.
This is the LE model but many interior items have been removed from the 2009 BASE model Rav4 to cut costs. Here is a short list:
Only one 12v outlet inside, none in center console and none in rear area
Delay wipers have no adjustment - 1 delay time only
No eyeglass storage in headliner above front seats.
Rear Seats no longer slide fore-aft and on and on.

Toyota also refuses to give an accessible plug for rear lights for trailers.
All Tacoma's and Tundra's have this plug under the bumper.
All interior rear panels on RAV must be removed to install the adapter: cost is $300+
Overall I would not purchase another RAV4."
"01 28, 2017",Great experience from start to finish,Zach was my salesman. He was very knowledgable of all cars on the lot. He helped me make the best decision within my budget and made it clear of what I was getting along the way as far as warranties. I live over 300 miles away and he helped me finish all of the paperwork over the phone. He registered my car with secretary of state and even had my plate on it when he had the car driven 150 miles north to meet me with my car! He went above and beyond throughout the process and I would highly recommend doing business with him.
"01  5, 2017","Not a Lexus, but what a car!","I highly recommend buying a Toyota RAV4 at a Lexus dealership. Great car. Great salesman (Ignacio), and great service."
"12 14, 2016",Great for family,"Economical and Worth the buy.  It saves on gas, handles the road smoothly and has a lot of space.  Beautiful exterior and interior. Makes sure to get the feature back up camera. It helps a lot."
"11 16, 2016",My Dream Car,"My 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD is my dream  car come true, superior Audio System, Reliability unmatched, outstanding exterior style design, AWD, Manual Option gears, optional Daylights, heated Side Driving mirrors, Moon Roof, a strong Roof Carrier with Cross Bars, good Gas Economy,  Roomy interior and Good Visibility- all in one package. However, I doubt the durability of the seats clothing and the dashboard padded cover below the audio screen and wish the GPS Navigation is inclued in the XLE package. Butf for now, I just love my practical RAV 4 like no other."
"09 27, 2016",Rough Ride,"I am very disssapointed with the hard ride of the car.
When it hits a bump or just a sewer cover,  even driving slow, it jars the entire car.  You feel like your are rocking and rolling and vibrates through your body.
Riding on the Belt Parkway recently, by the time i got home to Long Island, I was sick to my stomach from the ride.  Also does not handle well even on parkway, as it seems to wobble.
It also is noisy on the inside of the car when driving.
The voice recognition is not the best.
Very disappointed as I like the style, and setup of the car, but not the ride.  When I brought it in to have service manager drive it, he was in agreement with the hard ride.  Turns out one of the shock absorbers was leaking, but that did not make any difference when it was replaced.
Sorry to say, but this one has to go.\"
"09  3, 2016",Ada's review,"It's a very reliable car with a very smooth ride. The interior could be much better and not happy with the poor crash rating. Gas mileage could be much better, and the navigation system has limits, it won't accept all addresses."
"08 28, 2016",Most reliable crossover on the market,"This car is SUPER reliable. I have had zero issues with this vehicle and expect to drive it for many years to come. I live in the mountains and have taken this car on every terrain imaginable, and it performs every time. The quality on the interior certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but after trading in my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (w 28k miles), I know better than anyone that all the fancy features and comfort in the world do not make up for a mechanically unreliable vehicle. The Jeep was one problem after another, despite having only 28k miles.

In comparison, the Rav4 has needed nothing since the day I drove it off the lot. If some cheap details in the cabin are the worst thing about this SUV, then you know it's a good vehicle. Toyota did not cut corners where it counts with this vehicle (i.e. under the hood). Do NOT buy this car expecting a luxury ride or excellent features--buy this car because you want a vehicle that will get you where you need to go no matter what, and will last you 10+ years with minimal problems. Who cares if people think it's ""boring"" to drive? After my Jeep nightmare, I can tell you that it is WAY more boring to sit at a dealership for hours waiting for repairs!!

 When you start up the Rav you know you will get to your destination no matter what. At the end of the day, that's all I care about. If you're a buyer with similar priorities, you'll love the Rav4"
"08  8, 2016",never buy-- noisy Bluttooth and noisy drive,"unfortunately its not a good car to buy. very noisy drive on freeway and when you use car's Bluetooth on freeway, the other person thinks you car window is down. As per Toyota service manager its a built in technical fault and can not be fixed. 

I will suggest check this issue before buying."
"06 30, 2016",love it,"I purchased my Rav4 used.  I fell in love with it right away.  It handles well, turns great.  The A/C works great.  I wish the mirror adjustments, and the switches for the windows would light up at night.  I also think it is odd that I don't have automatic headlights.  My last car was a 2005 and it had automatic headlights.  That was disappointing. I love it anyway and would buy it again."
"06 18, 2016","good, not great, car","Body has  tight, solid feel to it.  Very easy and comfortable to drive and turning circle is small.  suspension fairly  stiff(l like that) rather than mushy. Very responsive to steering and brakes, really helped me avoid an accident.  Fantastic blind spot sensors and rear cross traffic sensors on Limited and great high beam auto dimmer as well.  Audio unit links pretty well and reliably with Moto-x phone.  Audio system sounds pretty decent on the Limited and has separate bass, mid , treble for each audio input type.  good lumbar support.  good interior room for class. absolutely great/powerful A/C.

cons:  lots of road noise at higher speed.  some areas of interior feel cheap and plasticky.  lots of rattling around the center console in cooler weather-very annoying.  only 3 band eq.  no usb folder browsing-very annoying.  accel just okay, would have been nice to have v6 option like they used to.  other aspects, like no illumination in the door lock controls, no homelink, no lights or reflectors  in the opened doors, etc., give the car a  low-end feel, even in the Limited.  Mileage I guess is about average for class, but gas tank seems really small, so I am refilling very often."
"05 22, 2016",A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"This car performs great but Toyota allows little things to make me think twice about it.
The window and mirror controls does not illuminate in the dark. USB just won't read folders unlike previous models including 2012 camry.
The cruise control is awkwardly placed , have to be looking down all the time.
USB READING FOLDERS IS MY BIGGEST HANGUP.
FIX IT TOYOTA !!!!!!!"
"04 29, 2016",Toyota no more,"Got Toyota due to its reliability ad. My big mistake. Expensive fixes at dealership match my 15 year old BMW expenses, but the frequency of it goes far beyond.
One thing for sure - Toyota advertisement worked."
"03 26, 2016",XLE 2015,"I have Toyota XLE 2015 and other than interior design, I'm really happy with it. It's very good in Gas and very reliable."
"02 14, 2016",Not the best car!,"I owned 4 Toyota cars before - 1 Corolla, 2 Camry, 1 RAV4. This is my 5th Toyota. Over the years Toyota quality has gone down. With this RAV4 2015, the interior is very dark specially in nights. The door lock / unlock, window roll-down lock, and mirror adjustment buttons are not lit. There is NO low-beam indicator on the dashboard. These are standard features in any other car. I asked the dealership to bring this to Toyota's attention. They refused to do it. Very disappointed with Toyota. This is my last one."
"02 12, 2016",Most reliable car I have owend.,I love my 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD I live in Nebraska and it does amazing in the winters here. It is very roomy and has plenty of rom for my grandchildren. I had a 2012 Ford Escape that I traded in because it had quite a few problems it started to jump some times when you hit the gas. I chose the Rav 4 because Toyota is very reliable. I LOVE MY RAV 4
"01 26, 2016",Nicest car I have ever owned,"First time I have ever got a vehicle with all the bells and whistles. Lane assist is amazing, had a neck fusion a few years ago. This helps me so much. I press a button on the steering wheel, a voice asks me what I want? I can change the channel on the radio, get directions, simply amazing."
"01  2, 2016",A quality car at a great price.,"I just purchased a new 2015 Toyota RAV4 and couldn't be more pleased. The car is very roomy for it's class. The car has a very tight + solid feel to it. The car looks great on the outside and the inside. The dash has a nice layout with all the controls within easy reach. I especially like the fact that the all wheel drive system, which is activated when the system detects wheel slippage, can be turned on manually when you are traveling in very slippery conditions provided you don't exceed 25 mph in the manually locked in mode.

I found the Toyota personnel including sales, management, vehicle service and clerical to be very pleasant and helpful. It was a very good buying experience. I highly recommend the RAV4."
"12 20, 2015",dim dashboard lights in the daylight,"I find that the dashboard light are dim in the daylight. When driving wearing sunglasses, I have problems seeing the odometer. I have to ride without wearing sunglasses in order to see how fast I'm going."
"12 16, 2015",Great on gas,So far I am concerned I am very pleased with the Rav 4 Limited. By buying the Limited we received things that we would have to pay for on other Rav 4's. Plenty of leg room both in the front and rear seats. Everything at your fingertips. You never need to take your hands off the wheel. The only thing that I think can be improved on is the size if the window where the radio and traffic is. It is hard to set up the nav trip because it is so small. But I love my Rave 4.
"12 10, 2015",Small Tank Capacity,"First off I'm satisfied with most things on my new 2015 Rav4. However I am very disappointed with the gas tanks fuel capacity. For the last 3 fill ups which I let go down to almost empty, I was only able to get between 46-48 Liters into the tank. I've addressed this issue with the dealer and Toyota Canada and both still think it is my faulty statistics that are wrong. I have documented through receipts and pictures as proof that that's all I'm able to get into the tank. They say continue to monitor. This is totally unacceptable given the specs say I should be able to get close to 60 L in the tank. As a result I'm filling up every week of my city commute. Anyone else having this issue???"
"12  1, 2015",toyota Rav 4,"I was overall impressed with this dealership at Hudiburg Toyota in MWC OK. My sales associate Greg Fanning was smart, honest, and detail oriented with everything that I wanted in my car. If he didn't know the answer than he would find the answer. He worked hard to give me the best price possible. I was very satisfied with the car that I purchased along with the customer service I received at the dealership. I would recommend this place along with Greg Fanning as the representative any day of the week!"
"11 15, 2015",My new RAV4,"My purchasing experience was excellent at Hudiburg Toyota. I just purchase a new car for me. My old 20 years old car broke, and I found a great deal and lots of help with Ralph Jones III.
At the dealership they guide me and advise on the choices that I had and they also informed me about the great benefits in all the options.
I appreciated all the help and the amazing that car that i have now, it is not also time to renovate but also to get something that fits my needs.

I am thankful to Hudiburg Toyota."
"11 14, 2015",Seems OK so far,OK but I would like less use of hard plastics and very low grade carpet. Some interior materials seem cheep. Macanicaly seems OK.
"11  8, 2015",love this car so far,"I just have this car for 2 months and I love it. Driving experience is smooth and comfortable. Rearview camera is very very helpful for parallel parking and backward parking. Well designed steering wheel make it so easy to control the audio system while you are driving-you can adjust everything with you thumb, even answer a call.
I always choose economic gas usage model so I spent almost the same gas money as I did on a Mazda protege before.
The only flaw so far is a little bumpy when you drive on a not-so-smooth surface. That's probably the problem for all SUVs."
"11  6, 2015",uncomfortable,"Front seats are ""NOT"" for bigger people. Drivers seat is too narrow for comfort. I am 6'2 and 230 lbs and made a big mistake buying a 2015 limited. Your right leg will ride on top of side buttress and if you go over 5 miles, you will be feeling it. Can't do anything about it now, just warn others. By the way, I love Toyota's- had a Camry before-wish I still had it. That's life. Oh, yes. if you are going from a regular car to an SUV, remember they are totally different beasts. Ride will be harsher, inside will be louder-think about it wisely."
"11  2, 2015",Perfect balance between luxury and utility,I have had 4 other Rav4's and this is the first Limited. Very nice vehicle with my only complaint being the somewhat narrow bucket seats. Nicely appointed and all the bells and whistles I could have wanted.
"11  2, 2015",NOT ALL IMPROVEMENTS ARE,"WITH 345000 MILES ON MY '99 RAV IT WAS TIME FOR NEW WHEELS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREAT 360 DEGREE WINDOW VISABILITY? THE BACK UP CAM DOES NOT COMPENSATE. INTERIOR - POORLY THOUGHT OUT. THE CUP WELLS SWALLOW THE CUPS. METAL TRIM STRIP IS SUN GLARING. WHY HIDE THE KEY IGNITION. USEFUL STORAGE IS HARD TO FIND / USE. WHY CANNT YOU DIM THE VIDEO SCREEN AT NIGHT (LIKE THE DASH LITES)? THANK GOODNESS THE '99 IS STILL IN THE DRIVEWAY. IT MAY TAKE ME TO 500,000 MILES YET"
"11  1, 2015",First Toyota,"I have had my RAV4 LE for 6 months and love everything about it except the black interior, everything seems to stick to it and it is hard to keep it looking clean. It is fun to drive, I have taken trips in it and it has done great and it is great for running around town in. This is my first Toyota, but it won't be my last."
"10 19, 2015",5K mile review,"So this is my 5th toyota I have owned through almost 19 years of driving. I have the 2015 Rav4 LE AWD model. I now have put on 5k miles through 6 months of ownership. The things I like about the vehicle: toyota reliability and dependability of course, nice acceleration, comfortable big seats, very generous leg room (front and rear), good trunk space, exterior styling, descent gas mileage (I get about 18.5 in the city and about 26 on the hwy.), and I love that it has a 6 speed automatic trans. Instead of the the CVT trans. Like the nissan rogue and honda cr-v. What I don't like about this vehicle: the seat fabric makes it challenging to keep extra clean, I would add a sunglass holder, I would make the front window sun visors to slide out for extra sun protection while driving, I would add a compass on the mirror for the LE model, instead of hub caps I would like alloy wheels, I would like splash guards to come with the vehicle, the Bluetooth does not always work, the doors seem really flimsy, especially the outside door handles, i would like the top of the front windshield to have a bit of tint to block some of the sun while driving, and I would like the front cup holders to be next to each other not a foot apart. This SUV may be a bit vanilla to most, but I take it for what it is: a company that built their good reputation throughout the years by making good quality cars that last a long time. So far no problems for me with this vehicle. I will add a review in years to come as the mileage piles up. Thanks!"
"10  3, 2015",Toyota RAV4: Great for short rides!,"Love my new Rav 4 Limited Edition. The 2 color leather seats are so stylish (Teracotta). So far (2 weeks) so good. However, IF YOU TAKE LONG DRIVES DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CAR. I took it on a LONG drive (5 hours each way) and felt like I was getting off of a horse when I arrived! My toosh was sore! The ""bucket seats"" really hug you -- too much. There's a lumbar support which I turned off to give me some relief. Thankfully I have the Limited edition with power seats which allow the driver to adjust the seats during the ride. Maybe it would be more comfy it you are really petite?
One other negative is that I found the leather seats hot on a long ride on a hot day. My lower back was sweaty! And I had the AC running on high! I'm guessing it's the leather snug seats? (never happened in my Camry LXE w/ leather seats). I love being up high\ which is a plus...This is a Small SUV inside, overall. I happen to like that, but if you're looking for a large SUV this isn't it. I drive this into NYC daily so didn't want a big car but did want to be HIGH up. I feel safe in this car! And the view is great! The front windshield is really wide! I have to get used to not having a trunk like I had in my Camry. I miss it. This has a nice hatch back area with a security shade. The seats in back go down very easily if you needed the room. I'm happy with it overall! We'll drive my husbands big car on long rides!"
"09 30, 2015",unimpressed,disappointed with performance and ride which is 90% of the reason for buying. test drive should have been longer. the more I drive the less I like it. Go for the limited version as the sound system in the xle sucks and no auto. button for the rear door sucks. There is really very little room to store things and even with seats down it fills up fast. Styling is nice and I'm hoping it handles well in the winter weather or I'll probably trade in and take a loss.
"09 26, 2015",Busy Mom,"I am very excited to own my new Toyota Rav4! It is a sporty yet classy vehicle. Previously I owned a Sequoia so I had some concerns with both the much smaller size and engine on the Rav4, however I am not disappointed at all. The Rav4 is more spacious on the inside then it looks on the outside. When I read reviews prior to my purchase others had mentioned problems with pick up and maintaining speed while going up hills. I have not found any of these problems to be true for me. In fact, on the contrary I am delighted with its performance. I frequently have to ramp onto dangerous and busy highways and have not had any concerns at all. I would strongly recommend this vehicle to others without hesitation."
"09 22, 2015",2015 RAV4 XLE,"2015 RAV 4 XLE is a vast improvement over the previous model. Prior to our 2015 we had a 2008 which was a good car but the styling, rear swing open tailgate and 4 speed transmission let it down. Our transmission would hut and violently downshift and upshift when going uphill at 65 MPH. We took it to the dealer for repair 3 times and they had no resolution. The mileage was also poor at 22 combined.
2015 PROS: 6 speed transmission like our 2013 Camry, Swing up lift gate, 28 mpg combined in eco mode, Back up camera. Touch screen, Driving range
CONS: Road noise higher than 2008 and MUCH Higher than in our Camry, Same fuel tank as Camry that shuts off at about 13GL. You can put 2 additional GL in both cars and increase range by 60 miles, Limited cubby/storage areas.
Overall the best choice and value in the category!!"
"09 21, 2015","Cute, but not so comfy","My first biggest complaint is the rock hard seats & uncomfortable road trip on my butt and back.
The engine idles loud.
The brake tends to be hard to keep down and constant pressure that it makes my foot cramp in rush hour traffic.
Lack of suspension, feels like the back end is going to drop out when hitting a small bump in the road or anything that is not a smooth surface.
The seats sit quite low, that I can't put my elbow on the door ledge to relax while driving.
The metal piece on top of dash is blinding when sun hits it, and you cannot read the clock if the sun is coming through the front windshield.
I have yet to get the GPS voice to work with my phone. If my bluetooth is on, I can't even hear the directions coming from my phone.
And I regret not getting power seats and power trunk.
I had a minivan that was 10 years old, that I can describe in two words...luxury ride!
I'm actually looking forward to selling it in about 15-18 months from now. I've already contacted my sales person and he's willing to help me out when that time comes....
I do many day trips, road trips and this car is not cut out for anything longer than a 30 minute drive to and from. I'm disappointed Toyota."
"09 10, 2015",BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN 30 YEARS,"HAD GREAT 2009 RAV4. TRADED IN FOR 2015 RAV
4. CANNOT DRIVE WITH LOW BEAMS AND SEE. LIKE DRIVING INTO BLACK WALL. HAD FOG I
LITES INSTALLED($400) SO COULD SEE ON LOW BEAMS. LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM. TEST DRIV AT NITE OUT OF TOWN AND YOU WONT BUY THIS MODEL. WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BULB CREATING THIS PROBLEM. BACKUP SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN IN SUNLITE, NO LOCKING GLOVE BOX, NO SUNGLASS STORAGE OVER DASH, NO DUAL CONSOLE STORAGE,NO DUAL GLOVE BOX, SMALLER SIDE VIEW MIRRORS. CANNOT COMMENT ON MILAGE AS ONLY HAVE 400 MILES ON IT. CONTACTED TOYOTA ANG GOT BLOWN OFF. VERY POOR CONSUMER RELATIONS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE. BE BETTER OFF WITH A CHEAPER MODEL OR MAKE."
"09  4, 2015",Fantastic SUV.,"Very comfortable with lots of room.

Unbelievable gas mileage, can not wait to drive it in the snow plus we got a super deal. We are very happy
With this vehicle."
"08 31, 2015",Best Car transaction ever,"I love my new car and the expedited ""buying time"" my dealer gave me. Everyone was respectful, listened to us, and answered all our questions. Excellent transaction."
"08 29, 2015",It's a good and reliable vehicle,"This is my second Rav4. Purchased the XLE trim this time. Traded in a 2010 Limited with a V6. Overall I'm happy with the vehicle. The sale price and 0% financing made it a logical choice without breaking the bank. Only reason I traded the 2010 was because it was FWD and I needed AWD.

Pros:
Interior space with back seats down
Eco, Normal and Sport mode choices and good fuel economy
Excellent crash tests and safety results
Relatively quiet ride, good visibility
AWD in the snow
Toyota quality and high residual value

Cons:
Weak lumbar support which can get uncomfortable on long drives
Fabric armrests on doors can show dirt easily
Small capacity fuel tank"
"08 19, 2015",Speedometer inaccuracy,"My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership. An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy. The warranty is 36,000 miles. That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty. Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300. Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer. I went through arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement on July 8, 2015. I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications. In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening. In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.
Otherwise the vehicle operates fine. However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers. I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device. It is definitely underpowered. Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy. Bluetooth doesn't always work. Great for hauling stuff. Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there."
"08 11, 2015",Best driving car I have owned,"I Love my new RAV4, and so do my Grandchildren who are 12 and 11. They like the room and the ease of getting their things out of thee back when we are just going a short distance. They think all the gadgets as they call them are COOL."
"08  7, 2015",best overall exceptional price,"Styling and price beyond comparison in its category and class. Human functionality fluid and above average. I am a large man and find the vehicle to be tight to get in and out of. There also seems to be a great deal of engine and road noise. These 2 factors are minor when considering all amenitys, standard options, and overall drivability of the vehicle. Recommend the Forerunner for anyone over 6'2 or 270 lbs. It was a very good fit. I still greatly enjoy the rav4 though."
"07 30, 2015",Not my best buy,"I traded in an older RAV for a 2015 LE model and I regret having done so. Incredibly the older RAV handled far better and the engine noise was quieter. The LE model doesn't come with fog lights and the black fillers make the vehicle look very tacky. The 2015 RAV acceleration is fair at best and the handling is far from special. Overall the 2015 Rav seems functional but functional is the kindest thing I can call it. It looks and drives like vehicle that should sell for several thousand dollars less. This is my third Toyota Rav and it's also my last one. I would gladly swap it for a competitor's model if I could. Pretty much any competitor. If you're determined to purchase a 2015 Rav, I strongly urge you to at least avoid the entry level LE model. It's somewhat cheaper and the slightly lower price is self evident in the vehicle itself."
"07 20, 2015",BlueTooth System is TERRIBLE!!!,"Bought a new car and the sales experience was incredibly bad- we were basically held hostage and not allowed to leave to eat. After 5 hours and 2 mistakes with the paperwork, we left. The Bluetooth system is very poor and no one can hear me when I call using it on the car. I have had it back to Toyota 3 times and they indicate it is my problem - not the car. this is my 4th new Toyota and will likely be my last as they don't want to fix the problem and most people believe it is the microphone. Buying a new car should be fun and exciting but not this time. I recommend you look to other companies due to the problems with the software and if hands-free is required in your state, this system is horrible."
"07 18, 2015",bought Toyotas for past sixteen years,I trust the Toyota product very happy with my choice. The city here gets a lot of rain and i like the little higher vehicle. Also I am tall and more comfortable getting in and out of this size vehicle. I love the interior all the accessories are easily accessible and right where I am accustomed to. It has a back up camera which I have learned to love for safety. I enjoy the seats folding flat for carrying larger items. The back door makes loading groceries easier and not as much stretch and bending. Appreciate the help with knowing prices thanks.
"07  2, 2015",Best of the three Toyota's I've owned.,"The RAV4 has a great sound system and handles like a dream. I've been to Geargia two times in the safest and most comfortable SUV It handles great, sight line is excellent, smooth transition of the gears good on gas."
"06 22, 2015",A Review of My 2014 Toyota Rav 4,"This comment applies to all Toyotas I have seen, but especially my 2014 Rav 4, which has black fabric seats.

The materials Toyota uses for fabric seats have never been particularly well chosen (from a design, look and feel standpoint).

My 2014 Rav 4 is a really terrific car in all ways but one - it has black fabric seats, and the fabric looks, and feels cheap, and is impossible to keep clean especially from pet hair (even when pets have never set foot in the car). The fabric is far more problematic than the fabrics in my 2012 and 2010 Ravs, although these were not stellar either by any means (just not like Velcro).

Toyota would do well to take a look at the fabrics used to upholster Honda CRV interiors, which look and feel far superior, and which do not function like Velcro for pet hair and similar stuff. It is the one major design flaw in the vehicle (looks like the 2015s are much the same!), and, it's so annoying, my next car my well have to be the Honda CRV instead."
"06 16, 2015",2015 Toyota Rav4 XLE.,"Though overall I like the vehicle, I was disappointed with 3 things that I thought were standard in XLE models (this is not basic model):

1) Does not have auto seat adjust.
2) Does not have lumbar support.
3) Does not have auto headlights.

Drive is very comfortable and could have few additional bells & whistle as blind spot indicator."
"06 11, 2015",First week down and I'm thrilled,"I was looking to replace my minivan with something smaller and more efficient but with large seating areas. I cannot believe how big the rear seat area is, even with the front seats all of the way back. The RAV4 sits higher than the typical economy sedan like a Corolla or Civic, so getting the kids in and out is much easier. This would likely also apply to seniors.
The car also drives very nicely. I cannot believe other reviews mention that it is underpowered. My FWD LE seems to scoot quite well. I also really like how the 6 speed auto transmission always seems to be in the right gear at the right time.
The thing about other makes is that when you get a base model the interior really looks like it. The base level LE RAV4 looks like a quality car from inside and out. The interior is beautiful, but oddly has mabye 5 or 6 different materials and textures. I am averaging 24+ MPG tooling around town so far, but have yet to take a long highway drive to test highway mileage.
I really am impressed with the integrated stereo/bluetooth phone controls/backup camera setup. Again, a base car with top line features. Stereo sound is very good IMO, especially in CD mode.
If you want a car that is small outside but very large and comfortable inside the RAV4 should be considered. For the price paid it can't be beat."
"05  6, 2015",Interior features not as good as our former 2007 R,"Short comings of Interior Design (vs 2007 RAV4)
Some panel light not lit without the lights being on
(requires turning on lights well before needed)
No place to store glasses or sunglasses
(In the 2007 RAV4 there was room for 3 pairs)
Not as many places to store misc small things (1 vs 2)
Console between seats lacks space for storage of
small, flat items, as was present on the 2007 RAV4.
The extra glove compartment of the 2007 RAV4 is now
only a shelf on the dashboard.

Even the 2007 RAV4 lacked storage space for flat materials such as maps, so they will continue to be stuffed between the seat and the center console."
"04 21, 2015",Great car,"I recently bought a 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD , and I love it. The color I picked is Barcelona Red and everyone that sees it thinks its a beautiful color. Does it ride like a luxury SUV? No but still, it rides smoother than a lot of small suv on the road. In short, I would recommend the rav 4 if you are looking for a small SUV with class and at a great price."
"04 13, 2015",Again,I have enjoyed my 14 year old Rav4 so much that I bought another one. Can't beat a good thing. So far so good.
"04 11, 2015","Toyota to the T, not for me","I ended up in a fender bender the other week and needed my vehicle repaired. I drive a 2010 Hyundia Electra. The only reason why I purchased this vehicle is the MPG's as I was driving 84 miles one way to work. When the economy was really bad back in 2011 I was desperate.

Anyway, this is an good vehicle, but sort of disappointed. For all of the hoopla of that Toyota's are exemplary vehicles to drive I just don't get it. They do drive pretty good, nice seating position, seats are decent but nothing to write home about. I had the AWD and experienced OK gas mileage. When I was on the highway I experienced roughly 27-29 MPG which isn't half-bad for AWD. As soon as I get to stop and go traffic I saw my fuel gauge drop. It has enough pep to merge with traffic but not enough to do any inspiring driving.

I guess that's just it. It does well enough on everything but nothing to say ""Wow I can't wait to drive this thing"". It was more or less ""I can't wait to get home"". I mean it's not a bad CUV but I can name a plethora of CUVs that I would look into getting prior to getting this. Maybe the Lexus version is more inspiring I would imagine.

Some months ago I test drove a 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4 cylinder in Louisiana. It was your standard front wheel drive mid range (latitude I believe) and I feel that it was more inspiring to drive this CUV.

The best way to describe it is to compare it to MR or MRS reliable. Their not bad and they get the job done just don't expect anything more."
"04  4, 2015",disappointed,"The seats are uncomfortable, rough ride, rigid frame and every pot hole, or bump in the road sends a jolt to the passenger's. Gas mileage sucks."
"04  1, 2015",Beware of salesman claiming blue tooth capability,"Just bought a new RAv 4- switched from an Altima. Was promised a hands free blue tooth system. Which is true as long as the only thing you want to do is make phone calls similar to the function of an old flip phone. Texting function has no voice recognition so you have to read and select pre-selected messages. When the salesman explained that unless i wanted to upgrade ($8,000.00 ) for the top line model, I would not have GPS on the car. I though fine. My abdroid phone will do that and if I have blue tooth. Im good. But the car will not let the phone do that at least not thru the speakers. I either have to spend time reprograming the system everytime I want to use a map app (not something that is hands free and I have to stop the car) or unpair the phone and not be able to get phone calls thru bluetooth. They suggested I should buy a new phone. Verizon guys assumed the car was before 2008--the programing was so simple (AND CHEAP FOR TOYOTA) also that a new phone would not fix the programing in the car. And every time you turn the car off it goes back to the default setting that plays all my ringtones like a playlist and then has map lady in background talking softly. The volume control needs to be VERY LOUD for the map app and will blast you on all other audio.

Also mileage is not as listed best is 27 not 31 mpg (with coasting down all hills and reduced speed. and worst is 18 not 22."
"03 29, 2015",NIce Car,Would recommend this vehicle for anyone driving a lot of miles but needs some space.Great for getting around in traffic or crowed parking lots.
"03 23, 2015",NEW 2015 RAV4 XLE,"Just replaced a 2014 RAV4 XLE that was totaled in an accident with a 2015 RAV4 XLE. Only difference was color change from Shoreline Blue Pearl to Super White. Great little CUV, no issues with year old unit in the 10k miles of ownership. This is my 10th Toyota and all have performed excellently. Strongest resale value of any small SUVs."
"03 15, 2015",Most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"Purchased 2015 Toyota RAV4
Pros - All wheel drive is excellent for our snowy Wisconsin winters
Cons ?Installing a very stiff suspension system to make it seem like it has sportier handling has produced an extremely harsh, rough ride with even the littles bumps creating a sharp jolt to the passengers.
--Toyota also decided to sacrifice driver comfort for anyone over 6? by:
1- Not allowing the seat to move back far enough and the driver to decide how much room to leave for the back seat passenger even though there is a lot of extra room behind it when no one is in the back seat. This keeps a taller persons knees against the dash and the cruise control to hit your leg.
2 -Only way to sit is with seat in reclining position making it impossible to maintain correct posture and avoid back problems.
3-Jamming the seat belt receiver clip below the seat bottom as well as being sandwiched tightly between the seat and center counsel rather than having it project above the seat so it can be used.
4-Unusable sun visor is recessed into the ceiling without any wide spot in the ceiling to grab and lower it.
5-Slush and salt builds up on inside bottom of the doors in winter driving regions. This increases rusting possibilities and falls off in the garage or on a person?s lower legs as you exit the vehicle.
6 -Difficult entry for tall person due to sharp sloping roof line.
7-Ridges on top of front fenders make it impossible to judge where outside edges of front fenders are. Terrible to park and drive in town."
"02 20, 2015",Well designed reliable nimble and sharp to look at,"We bought the Toyota based on the extreme reliability we enjoyed with our previous 2009 Toyota Camry. The Camry was driven 165000 miles including severe winter weather with salt and snow covered roads common to Vermont. When we traded the Camry it still looked and drove great. It was on its second set of brake pads. The original set was replaced at 110000 miles. The rotors were fine. The only repair item needed was a water pump at 125000 miles. We always used synthetic oil. The engine stayed clean and ran like new.

If the Rav 4 is as reliable as the Camry we will be happy.
We went with the Rav 4 because of the extra cargo capacity and all wheel drive. It's s very comfortable car to drive on the highway. Gas milage is around 25-27 mpg so far. Six speed transmission is smooth and is always in the right gear for each driving condition. We especially like the push button keyless ignition that came with the limited edition."
"02  2, 2015",smaller,I aqm pleased with the new Rav4. I have some problems with the location of controls such as cruise control. Lots of whistle and gadgets to distract a driver. Communication with the sales person after the sale has been a problem. Part of the deal was a trailer hitch. We purchased the vehicle on 6 Jan 2015. the hitch still needs a wiring harness. Way to long to complete the installation.
"01 28, 2015",Stylish and fun,"I love the style, the interior, backup camera, navigation system, sound system, handlingPlus there is a lot of room inside and in the back,. The only thing missing I wished that it had is where you can program it for your garage door opener. If it has that I haven't found it yet."
"01 25, 2015",great car,Love every thing abou this car except hard to understand how to set up the radio etc . Speaker blue tooth is dificult for people to understand me.
"01 10, 2015",not a bad ride...,"I do not agree with the writer that was comparing his V6 limited Rav4 with this one... its like comparing the old style Rav4 with the 4 cylinder with the V6 model... two totally different vehicles.. MOST people that are buying a smaller SUV are buying it to get them higher off the ground than a sedan, easier access to and better storage and the availability of 4 wheel drive... I had a V6 Rav4 as well, and it was way too powerful for that size of a vehicle... I now have a 2013 Rav4 and its great at doing what it was made for... I lug two 16 year old boys to away hockey tournaments all the time in it, with two adults in the front... and the dashboard is perfectly placed, simple to use and works well... I'm 6'3"", 240 lbs and I have no problem getting in or out of this vehicle and quite comfortable in it for long drives... I will say that the 2009 Rav4 I had, was of a bit better quality (plastics, etc) but for what I paid, I like this mid size SUV..."
"01  8, 2015",Poorest suv i've ever had,Wish i had not bought this RAV4...i have bought the Honda CR-V and is perfection...this is a poor design SUV and with the poorest client service
"12  7, 2014",Not recommended,It is just a nice try. 4 cylinder engine is not performing at all. Currently I have a 2012 V6 limited and I am extremely happy with the car. I test drive one 2015 4 Cylinder fully loaded one. It was a big frustration new RAV4 is NOT performing on the road at all. If you like to have a car can deal with the winter conditions like me I suggest to think twice to buy new RAV4
"11 14, 2014","nice car ,toyota brakes","first Toyota I've owned-roomy inside, great view of road. braking is only thing I don't like- car feels like it accelerates when you are braking. Specialist checked and stated this is normal for a Toyota, says it is safe-just feels a bit unnerving to have car ""accelerate"" when you are braking. wish breaking was smoother."
"11 10, 2014",Smart and Stylish Reliable Car,"The car as beautifuly stylish as smart. Considering that's a pretty big car I highly recommend to buy TechPackage if you want to save time, nerves and skip guessing (especially going back).
Depending on your road conditions you can choose Sport, Eco (economical) or normal Drive Mode. Most time I use Eco Mode because like I said that's a pretty big car!.
One more benefit - Moon Roof: you may add some fresh air with less noise and polution from a road. And there is plenty of room for 5 people. I LOVE MY NEW CAR !"
"11  1, 2014",Best deal in town,"Received the best deal in town at Hendrick Toyota of Merriam kansas. Worked with me to make sure I was completely satisfied with my deal. Pleasant & friendly. Would recomend you purchase your next car. I worked with Jennifer Vinson, Jeff Breaux and Robert Biehl."
"10 26, 2014",Wonderful car,"My new 2015 RAV4 Limited replaces my 2004 RAV4 Limited. The new car is much bigger than the old one. It is nearly as big as my 2005 Highlander. The car rides firmly but comfortably. The engine power could be stronger but it is adequate. The navigation system has made several minor errors but no system is 100% accurate. I've been averaging about 24 mpg for combined local and highway driving. The back-up camera with cross traffic alert, the blind spot monitors and the lane departure alert are very welcome and useful features. The JBL sound system is excellent. There is plenty of storage space in the cabin, but I miss the small draw in the dash of my old RAV4 that I used to hold coins for parking meters. The placement of the vanity mirror light in the ceiling rather than on the visor provides better lighting. I also like the power lift gate. It is much more convenient than the old horizontally opening door with the spare mounted on it. The spare is now out of the way under the floor of back cargo area."
"12  5, 2017","Best most reliable car I've ever,ever owned!!","Where do I start it has everything I need such as all wheel drive when I need it , roomy for the family nice big back to put many things comfortable in the back!!! It's a Toyota need I say too much more, they are reliable for the long haul and that's what you want when you work hard for your living!!! I've had Toyotas in the past and they have gone and gone beautifully!!! This RAV4 suites and meets my every need and Toyota is where I'm staying all the way always!!!!!!  Sooooooo Happy!!!!!!"
"12  2, 2017",Greatest car I?ve ever owned,"This car is amazing! I went from a small 2004 Toyota Camry to this 2015 Toyota RAV4. And I?m not disappointed! I have enough room for the whole family, including the dogs. We are able to tow our jet ski with it which was a must have for me. It is easy to drive and park (I suck at pulling into parking spots if there?s people on either side because I get nervous) so it?s been great for me. The touch screen radio and backup camera are great. The backup comes in handy when needing to hook up the jet ski. My fiancee and I even took this car deer hunting and it drove through gravel and fields just fine. The gas mileage was great while making the five hour drive home from when we picked it up. I believe it was around 34mpg. My fiancee is also a mechanic, so he will NOT let me buy any sort or motorized equipment without him thoroughly looking it over. The RAV4 got his approval right away. He said it was safe and reliable and that we will be able to drive this car for another 15-20 years. Very happy that this is the car we went with as I wanted a Jeep. Glad my fiancee and family talked me out of it."
"12  1, 2017",Great Car,"Performs as well as any car I have ever owned including sports cars.  Great performance either in city or highway.  enjoy the styling, comfort and accessories.  This car has it all."
"11 28, 2017",Excellent handling and comfort,"2015 Toyota RAV4 handles well and offers a smooth ride. I just traded up from 2009 Rav4, which had more storage and hiding spaces. I really prefer the side hinged door to the upper lift"
"11 26, 2017",Good so far,"I just bought this vehicle a couple weeks ago, it works very well so far. Although, a message popped up saying it needed maintenance, that?s an easy fix, I hope."
"11 26, 2017",The most reliable car I?ve ever owned,The reason I bought this car was because of it?s performance and reliability I like the exterior styling and the comfortable interior design
"11 22, 2017",Amazing size as style,I love the ease of driving it. It's a safe and reliable car on the road and has a nice and roomy interior.
"11 21, 2017",Vehicle Review,"Safe, wonderful family vehicle. Love the navigation and features that this vehicle has. I needed something that would help me feel safe on long trips back East to see family"
"11 20, 2017",Great suv strongly recommend to anyone great on ga,Comfy stylish roomy radio speakers good bluetooth..has crusise control nice car for the price ..nice
"11 10, 2017",So far so good!,"Reliable!!!  Looks nice.  Love the all wheel drive!  Roomy with lots of space!  Love the back up scree
N"
"11  9, 2017",Wonderful car!,"All Toyota are great cars, but the Rav4 is perfect for me. I work about 40 minutes away from home so, I am on the road a lot. I feel very safe in my Rav. Having a compact SUV is nice because you have a lot of room inside without feeling like you are driving a spaceship."
"11  6, 2017","Love Toyota?s anyway, but this car drives so nice.","Drive 3 teens to school each day with 3 big backpacks, fits everyone and everything great. Rains a lot in this state and I feel very safe in it,. Love the backup camera also."
"11  3, 2017",My Car,"I purchased this from a dealer. Owned it for a year and drove all type of roads. I could transport the items that i thought it won't fit. No regrets in having this car. 

Amazing Car !"
"11  2, 2017",Reliable car,"This car was a great AWD vehicle. I enjoyed driving it.Very comfortable. The gas tank is a little smaller than most cars but avg MPG was around 24-26. I've been told the Bluetooth sound while calling others had a ""tinny"" sound."
"10 25, 2017",Great Vehicle,This car meets all of my needs as of now. Of course I would have liked to have climate control and moon roof but those are not necessities. Its spacious enough for a family of four and everyone loves it. The mileage could improve a little but I think its still much better than other SUVs in the market.
"10 21, 2017",Great Car,"As a previous owner, we were delighted to test drive this vehicle.  In fact, we bought it.  An upgrade for us include rear camera.  We are so excited!"
"10 19, 2017",A great car at a good price,This is a great car for the working man or women. Although its small in size it has plenty of room for a big guy.  Love the back up camera and blue tooth.  you will be amazed at the performance and turning radius of this Toyota RV 4.
"10 17, 2017",Needed something with a little more space.,This car appears to be large enough to meet my needs.  More space for my golf equipment and dog kennel.
"10 15, 2017",Great car for it's value! Very fun!,This car is great for it's value! Very fun to go off road in road trips. Pretty spacious and comfortable and the cargo size is neat too. Couple of people complained about the performance. Of course this is not a performance heavy vehicle but I had no problems with it during the snow and going a bit off road.
"10  7, 2017",Toyota Rav4 Totally Reliable,"The car is roomy, comfortable, mechanically reliable, good on gas.  It  short coming for me are storage related. The arm rest moves when you lean on it, and there are no innovative storage locations like you'd find in a Jeep Cherokee Latitude under the seat or in the rear of the SUV."
"10  5, 2017",Descent Car with a few flaws,"The 2015 Toyota Rav 4 is a reliable car, but does have some flaws that I believe Toyota could've done better with. First lets start off with the Steering. Sensitivity of the steering  is just outrageous. It is too sensitive to a point where changing lanes could easily make you side-swipe another vehicle. Then comes road noise. I believe more sound dampening materials could've been added to the vehicle to block more noise. Other than that, this is a great reliable vehicle."
"10  2, 2017",It?s the perfect suv for the family,"The RAV4 is good SUV very Reliable, Spacious, very good torque and power for Four-cylinder engine more than you need for your family SUV. Value for the money is great. The only think I don?t like about it is when you drive on the highway the car is loud it?s not Isolated perfectly so there is always a wend sound on the highway and the engine is loud too.Stability is perfect and visibility is one of the best on the market for the category."
"10  1, 2017","Very reliable, and great on gas","This car is very reliable. THe interior is very spacious, and when the back seats are lowered, it hauls almost anything.  The gas mileage surprised me for an all wheel drive vehicle.  When we put winter tires on it, It became a tank in the winter.  It pushes through the snow better than my truck.  Great all around vehicle.  I Love it."
"10  1, 2017",Love my 2015 RAV4!!! (Later Release),"This car has way better MPG than advertised. Also, looks very nice and it?s is quite comfortable. I took it off the road and it was a beast. Great car for the money you pay!"
"09 27, 2017","Great Deal, Seamless Purchasing Process","After reviewing competitive pricing online for Toyota RAV4's for cost perspective, we visited this dealer with our wish list and were immediately taken to a spotless 2015 RAV4 with unbelievably low mileage.  We would describe the car as ""barely driven"".
Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.   
What we thought would be a stressful search for a ""new"" car turned out to be anything but stressful. 
Steve Skolnick, our salesman, was happy and we were happy after a short transaction.  
We love the car and our pleasant sales experience!"
"09 26, 2017",Loving my RAV4 2015,"RAV4 does not need a review because it is prooved to be one of the best vehicles within 30K.  Very comfortable from the first ride.  I had a chance to drive 2017 and 2015.  I chose 2015 as a better value.  I like bigger side mirrors so you could see a few lanes around.  I almost do not need to use rear mirror.  In 2017 they messed with side mirrors, they are smaller, but 2017 has new fixtures like brake assist and cruise control assist.  It is really something to consider"
"09 26, 2017",Most reliable with style and compfort,"This car gives all u need in your car like style size and sefty mileage looks reliablety with confidence,and wourth of investment"
"09 25, 2017",Most practical and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is great on gas, reliable in the winter and comfortable for taking long trips. It is also practical for all kinds of activities since it has a roof rack and plenty of space in the back. It is stylish and compact so it is a great transition for those used to driving smaller cars."
"09 23, 2017",About my RAV4,Very nice SUV for the $ but get the 4WD instead of 2WD if you use it in snow prone winters.  Mine didn't make it up the hill to my house 1 night and cost me a tow to get home
"09 19, 2017",1st new car owned and love it,"So happy with my Toyota RAV4   -  I proud to drive my Toyota, great car and Great gas milage ! 
Only wish it had more little compartments to put things in ."
"09 18, 2017",Amazing car for the price!,This car is reliable. Great for the price and looks nice. Definitely better than the CR-V in my opinion. It just feels nicer and more sporty.
"09 15, 2017",Very nice for a smaller suv,I think it is perfect for the price. I think they all need a sunroof though! It drove great and the ride was pretty smooth.
"09  9, 2017",Very reliable,"I am a college student and I don't live on campus, I commute. This car is perfect because it does not give me any trouble. I drive about 400-500 miles a week for work and school, so this is it guys, if you are looking for something reliable!"
"09  4, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"I like the styling, gas mileage is okay to good for the class, Toyota reliability.   Drives fine, a slight sport feel."
"09  2, 2017",Love my car!,Traded my 2008 Rav4 limited for a 2015 RAV4 limited. Loved my 2008 and love my 2015. Great comfort and leg room. Fun to drive! Great car.
"08 31, 2017",It's a good car.,"It's similar to Honda CR-V; acceleration was not as good as a compatible CR-V, even though RAV4 has slightly larger engine (2.5L vs. 2.4L)."
"08 27, 2017",Toyota: #1 in our book,"The 2015 RAV  we just replaced with a new RAV was an amazing vehicle.....So was its predecessor , the Matrix,......... we are certain our new RAV will be just as loved.   The way these vehicles handle is great...... you can ""turn on a dime"".   They are super reliable.....good in any weather or road conditions.  They look good and drive even better. ...Unbeatable!"
"08 24, 2017",Most reliable car I ever owned,Eye catching  exterior design.  Very reliable  and have  good gas mileage.  Like the E-tune sound system.
"08 16, 2017",Looks and runs great,"I am an Uber driver, good size back seat and trunk space. Great maneuverable and acceleration.Very good gas mileage."
"08 14, 2017",BRILLIANY!,Great visibility and safety features are awesome. Large back up  view camera. Stylish and comfortable.
"08 14, 2017",Best purchase ever made!!!,I absolutely love my RAV4! I previously owned a 2005 Dodge Neon SXT and loved it but this RAV4 is much more reliable and just my style!!!
"08 12, 2017",Excellent SUV for the money!,"This is my favorite vehicle to drive. It drives and handles like a car. Compared to my 2012 Chevy Sonic, which is a small car, it is very nimble and quick. Brakes are excellent no worries there. Would definitely recommend the All Wheel Drive (AWD) addition, seems to have a little more pep. I love that you can choose your driving type by the push of a button (Economy, Sport). Great Job Toyota!"
"08  8, 2017",Love the handling of this car,Excellent in the winter.  Very easy to park and drive it is very dependable and it is just a great car
"08  6, 2017",Most reliable car I owned,"This car met my needs. Reliability, safety, comfortability, and power expectation are few of the things I love with this car."
"08  1, 2017",Luv my new ride!,"My 2015 RAV4 Ltd ROCKS!  This vehicle is awesome! It is easy to drive and comfortable.  It has  an excellent backup camera, cross traffic warning, AWD, lane departure warning, navigation, blind spot monitoring, blue tooth, and on and on and on.   I traded in my Toyota Highland Hybrid for this SUV and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
"07 31, 2017",Love my new Rav4,"Just bought this car last week so this is  based on a short time frame, but so far I LOVE this car.  Great interior- tons of space and very comfortable.  Not as great of gas mileage as I had anticipated, but I have to drive in traffic every day so that's not unexpected.  Love the body style, love the details inside.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small SUV!  Feels like a huge upgrade from my 1999 Subaru Forester. ;)"
"07 31, 2017","Quality, performance & reliability","I love this AWD SUV, I added a brush guard to mine, it has been flawlessly reliable. 
The one touch seat folding is great, it has a lot of space in the back. 
It's great on gas, comfortable seats, perfect height to see clearly on the road, super easy to park, I love the back up camera with the wide angle lens, the all weather mats are perfect."
"07 30, 2017",Toyota reliability & performance,"This car is an example of value for money without the pricey gimmicks.
Toyota is the most reliable brand I have ever owned and this vehicle has been proved to out perform Honda."
"07 26, 2017",As reliable as American Cars used to be.,This is an excellent car and is extremely reliable and easy to learn how to use all it's features.  I challenge square dance and sometimes travel hundreds of miles to dance.  At least 5 of my dancing friends have RAV4's and they also swear by them!
"07 23, 2017",Love My RAV !,"I simply love this SUV. Decent gas mileage, comfortable, solid construction.  I bought the RAV4 XLE with cargo cross bars, remote rear tailgate, premium stereo with NAV AND REARVIEW camera."
"07 22, 2017",Eyecatching!,Fun to drive.  Sporty-looking.  Comfortable interior with easy access to knobs and controls.  A definite head-turner!
"07 16, 2017",Great reliable crossover,"Decent gas mileage, good leg and head room, good ride and has been reliable so far.  Few squeaks and rattles but not excessive. Would buy again!"
"07 12, 2017",Great car,This car meet all my needs! Had just enough bells and whistles without being too much. Loved the backup camera!
"07  9, 2017",Solid Vehicle,I purchased this vehicle based on my experience with Toyota products. Very reliable.  It also fit my needs of having a usable back seat and room for dogs in the hatch.
"07  6, 2017",2015 Toyota RAV4 LIMITED,"Comfortable, Reliable, safe, Great value, holds 5 passengers and lots of room for things in the back. Good MPG city and road. Air conditioner second to none I ever owned. steering, braking, sure footed.  Excellent re-sale value. Give it a rating of 9 out of 10 on a *soft ride* Navigator is wonderful.  My Toyota dealer is great!"
"07  5, 2017",A smooth ride!,"My husband and I test drove this car, but after some discussion, we decided to buy another car at this dealership. It was a hard choice between this car and a Subaru, but we are happy with our final decision."
"07  5, 2017",Most reliable car I have ever owned ????,"In brief this car met all my family needs, selling it just because I need a bigger car. I loved so much and it's price and mileage such a value compared to the money ??????"
"07  5, 2017",I love it!,"This is a wonderful vehicle!  Good gas mileage and very peppy!  No lag when you step on the gas.  I have the limited with the tech package, so I have the blind spot alert (very nice!) and the lane departure warning.  Back up camera with cross path detection is great also, especially when your backing out of a parking spot in a busy parking lot and you cant see around the vehicles next to you.  I also like that I can turn on the AWD full time when I chose to."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."
"06 29, 2017",A very sensible care,Very capable car that can get you from point A to point b. It handles well on city streets and on the highways. Plenty of room for hauling moderately sized items; leg room adequate for an above average height person.
"06 29, 2017",RAV 4 is the best Mid SUV investment you can make,"I researched cars for days on end. Looking for the most bang for my buck, since cars cost a lot of bucks. The Honda CR-V is popular and reliable but the drive was too fluffy feeling, not much power or control. The Mazda CX-5 was very impressive, but the RAV 4 just took the prize. It drives exceptionally well for an SUV and looks amazing. The reliability is off the charts and feels so safe to drive. It is by far THE Best Mid Size SUV on the market."
"06 29, 2017",comfortable car and economical driving,"the car price is very reasonable. after almost 2 years driving, the average MPG is 25. It is safe and comfortable vehicle. the space inside is enough for four person, including a car seat. And the storage room is also enough for family use."
"06 18, 2017",I love this car it's confot when you are driving,What I love for this car is  you will not use a lot gas and also is comfort when your driving Toyota is the number one preferred car
"06 16, 2017",I love the roominess in my  SUV,"We love this vehicle, but we do miss a couple things that we feel should have been on this vehicle since it was so expensive. Like on my Mazda 6 it had an alarm and a light come on the side mirrors to alarm you of cars in the other lane. We miss that. And the inside controls like window locks etc. lite up at night."
"06 13, 2017",A Split Decision,"The Wife loves this vehicle. She drives it in town. I don't love this vehicle. I drive it on highways.
We like the roomy, versatile, and comfortable interior. The gas mileage predictions are fairly accurate. It makes it up our steep Minnesota driveway with ease.  Maneuvers into a tricky garage better than others we tried. Styling isn't a big deal to us, but it looks like every other crossover on the road.
The bottom two inches of the inside of the front doors is outside so road slush builds up on them. Stupid and messy. Gas tank only allows a range of about 360 miles. Not enough. No interior storage. Adequate power in flatlands. Gutless in mountains. I have not been able to detect any difference between Sport/Eco modes. There is a problem with the driver seat/ steering wheel relationship. With seat pushed back the ""telescoping"" wheel is too far away (and I have long arms). On snow and ice it likes to obey the laws of inertia and continue in a straight line when you're trying to make it turn. Two years in I'm afraid it's going to last forever. Good thing the Wife likes it."
"06 13, 2017",A beautiful donkey,"I am reading all sort of stuff here about this car.I own a 2013 rav 4 .not comfortable????Are you kidding me?Not fast?Buy a Ferrari...Not stylish?Go get a Pontiac Aztec....Just kidding.
I tell you what.For the price ,the XLE model is the bargain of the century.As for performance is probably the best compromise ever.Buy the 4x4 if you live in a snowy state,buy the xle instead of the le model,and make yourself a favour and get rubber mats.Change the oil and filters as recommended and don t abuse it off road because is not a 4 runner or a highlander.Also,please don t put your stinky feet on the dashboard,don t eat a whole buffet while driving,and don t put your stupid dog on the front passenger seat...Even the rav 4 is not built for that..."
"06 12, 2017",Smooth!,"I was driving a Jeep and got addicted to being up a little off the ground like a regualr car.  Though our Jeep was about the same size, the design is great and lots of leg room for both the front and back seats.  The head room feels great and I love the safety features."
"06  7, 2017",Well worth the price,"This SUV was perfect for me. I could fit my three cocker spaniels in the back seat, the drive was smooth, and it maneuvered easily through main highways. I easily fit in normal parking spaces, the vehicle was excellent when I was in a rear end collision and protected me. My biggest disappointment was that because all the airbags deployed it was a loss."
"06  6, 2017",Much improved from the 2010 model,"REally enjoy driving this car, plenty of room and great gas mileage and plenty of room to carry cargo"
"06  4, 2017",Awsome car i have owend,"This car is perfect that i expected. This car is so comfortable. I recomend some peole who are looking for perfect car buy this car. And, i think it was resonable price for me"
"06  3, 2017",good small car,"good for short drives  wheel base to short  for smooth ridegood gas milage ,not enough cargo space good car for the money"
"06  3, 2017",Very cheap upolstery used on the seats,"I have owned Toyota vehicles for over 20 years, so when I decided to lease a 2015 Rav4, I was optimistic it would not let me down. Within just a couple of months, the drivers seat had a small hole in it. It was at a place where there could be nothing on your clothing, or body, to make a hole. I took my car in for its service to be done and informed the service manager about the issue. After a lot of talking back and forth with Toyota, they finally agreed to replace the cover for the seat, and told me that it was a ""one time deal"". Well, since then, I have had 3 more rears in the upolstery. I have no idea how it has happened, but I can tell you that there is no one that sits where the tears are. I am really disappointed with the quality of fabric Toyota has used for the seats. I am seriously thinking of getting out of my lease early.  Oh, by the way, this car was purchased brand new, with 40 miles on it."
"06  2, 2017",I love it,This car is very comfortable and has a lot more room than i expected. It runs beautifully and is very reliable.
"05 31, 2017",Great car!,"This is my 3rd RAV4. It's a great all-around vehicle. I've had two with the tire on the rear door, and now I have the newly style RAV4."
"05 30, 2017",Great upgrades!,"I bought the limited trim for the RAV4 and all of the upgrades make this vehicle go from good to great! Seat position memory buttons, heated seats, leather interior, extra subwoofer in the back, lane departure alert, upgraded stereo, and more. The vehicle rides very nice and is super reliable."
"05 29, 2017",Paint chipping on 2015 Rav4,"Great vehicle, nice ride, terrific reliability and value. However, small pencil size chips on the hood started showing up after the purchase. Now, two years into the vehicle, at least 15-20 of those chips has appeared. The chips are not because of road debris, but are due to inferior painting processes.  Online research shows many complaints of the same issue. Otherwise, fantastic vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Love this car. Best choice I've made so far,"Love it. Smooth, spacious and comfortable. Love the sunroof and back up camera is a life saver. The interior is beautiful"
"05 21, 2017",Great car!,"Wonderful value and features! This car is beautiful , I love the moon roof! It's very reliable and efficient too"
"05 10, 2017",Leasing a Rav 4 2015,"This is the worst vehicle anyone  can lease or purchase. First when I went to sign the papers and give them a check of 4,000.00 plus 1,600.00 to insure the vehicle of scratches. When I asked to see the vehicle they refused to bring it for me to look at it unless I sign the papers, and they said it was in another lot. They refused to give me a test drive. So it wasn't until I signed the papers when they decided to bring me the vehicle. So when driving the vehicle home I notice that it sounded like a truck it felt like a truck. Did not like the sound of it.  Within that week I had to do alternate side so as I'm waiting in the have the running to keep warm since we're in the month of November I notice the gas gage is moving as if I'm driving the car. I right away took the car back to Toyota and complaint to them about this problem. They apparently check it out they claim there's no problem. It's been a year and 6 months and I'm still having this problem.  I hate this car with a passion."
"05  8, 2017",Good little SUV,i love the reliability of this car. drives really nice for long trips. its very versatile for everyday life. i have two dogs and they fit in the back nicely. if you get this vehicle get a different seat texture...i.e. leather or faux leather...if you have pets.
"05  6, 2017",Rav4 Toyota,"Ok car but I will not buy again
For the money it cost
Lack at comfort  in tow especially 
Should cost less"
"05  4, 2017",Dream Car,"Best vehicle I've ever owned! Beautiful interior, especially the leather touches on the interior Limited. Excellent room in the trunk and nice little touches that make it feel luxurious! Very reliable and will probably last forever!"
"04 30, 2017",The best vechile I ever purchased,"I purchased my RAV 4. This has been the best Toyota vehicle I have bought thus far. I previously purchased a 2010 Camry SLE/XLE.   The RAV 4 is more roomy, stylish, excellent driving in snow & ice. Good gas mileage also"
"04 24, 2017",Rav4 ever,"Great vehicle for the money, would recommend it to anyone, looking for a nice vehicle. A very reliable transport."
"04 24, 2017",My favorite I am on my 5th Toyota,Love the Ravs my 2nd one I have owned it's like running around on skates so very easy to get around in .
"04 22, 2017",Entune system is unreliable,"The performance of the sound system is very good. However, the Entune voice activated navigation function is laughable at times. It works properly about 50% of the time and often can't tell the verbal difference between Arizona and Maine."
"04 12, 2017",Great Vehicle,Me and my wife purchased a 2015 Toyota Rav-4 brand new and absolutely love the vehicle! The styling is sharp and the performance is impressive for a smallish SUV.
"03 30, 2017",Good Car so Far,"I traded in a 2010 Toyota for this 2015 RAV4. I have only had the RAV4 a few days and am very pleased with it thus far. If this Toyota is as reliable as the one I traded, I will be very pleased."
"03 30, 2017",Retired,"Nice looking, comfortable car with many good features.  Easy handling, ease in using the computer with navigational feature.  Plenty of room."
"03 14, 2017",I love this Rav4,This is my 4th Rav and my next one will be a rav I love this suv it handles so nicely it looks great and I love driving  it
"03  6, 2017",Fantastic Rav4,"I've never purchased a new vehicle before, but struck gold with this one. We test drove the new Subaru Forrester, Mazda CX-5, and this one when we were shopping. We intentionally didn't test drive the Honda CR-V since we didn't like the design. 

We were wowed with the comfort and control. We also like the exterior design and interior layout. It's a great vehicle and has been very dependable. We did have to get the wheels re-aligned after 1.5 years of driving, but I know I've hit a bump or two at a fast speed and was not surprised. We love the car and plan to have it for years to come. 

We got the basic package to keep the cost down, but we kind of wish we had the electrical back door and interior lights for the door electronic controls. Can't really see the button to unlock doors when it's dark out."
"03  1, 2017",Very Good but Not Great. Poor Transmission,"Overall this is a good car but Toyota cut corners from the previous 2008-11 generation.  My previous Rav4 was a 2009 AWD. The ride is improved and is quieter than last generation.  A big complaint is the 6-speed transmission. This RAV4 is programmed to always go to 6th gear, even at 45 mph.  That is about 1400 rpm and the engine has LOW torque. Also with 2 people in car at 70 mph on a 2% grade it cannot hold speed in cruise control and harshly downshifts from 6 to 4th gear revving engine to 4000. This occurs on every small grade.  Cruise control also Downshifts on a downhill grade to slow the car and does not upshift  for 5-7 seconds after you reach level ground. Just Wierd !!  The integrated phone and audio system is good. The AWD system is very good and average mileage is 24+ mpg.
This is the LE model but many interior items have been removed from the 2009 BASE model Rav4 to cut costs. Here is a short list:
Only one 12v outlet inside, none in center console and none in rear area
Delay wipers have no adjustment - 1 delay time only
No eyeglass storage in headliner above front seats.
Rear Seats no longer slide fore-aft and on and on.

Toyota also refuses to give an accessible plug for rear lights for trailers.
All Tacoma's and Tundra's have this plug under the bumper.
All interior rear panels on RAV must be removed to install the adapter: cost is $300+
Overall I would not purchase another RAV4."
"01 28, 2017",Great experience from start to finish,Zach was my salesman. He was very knowledgable of all cars on the lot. He helped me make the best decision within my budget and made it clear of what I was getting along the way as far as warranties. I live over 300 miles away and he helped me finish all of the paperwork over the phone. He registered my car with secretary of state and even had my plate on it when he had the car driven 150 miles north to meet me with my car! He went above and beyond throughout the process and I would highly recommend doing business with him.
"01  5, 2017","Not a Lexus, but what a car!","I highly recommend buying a Toyota RAV4 at a Lexus dealership. Great car. Great salesman (Ignacio), and great service."
"12 14, 2016",Great for family,"Economical and Worth the buy.  It saves on gas, handles the road smoothly and has a lot of space.  Beautiful exterior and interior. Makes sure to get the feature back up camera. It helps a lot."
"11 16, 2016",My Dream Car,"My 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD is my dream  car come true, superior Audio System, Reliability unmatched, outstanding exterior style design, AWD, Manual Option gears, optional Daylights, heated Side Driving mirrors, Moon Roof, a strong Roof Carrier with Cross Bars, good Gas Economy,  Roomy interior and Good Visibility- all in one package. However, I doubt the durability of the seats clothing and the dashboard padded cover below the audio screen and wish the GPS Navigation is inclued in the XLE package. Butf for now, I just love my practical RAV 4 like no other."
"09 27, 2016",Rough Ride,"I am very disssapointed with the hard ride of the car.
When it hits a bump or just a sewer cover,  even driving slow, it jars the entire car.  You feel like your are rocking and rolling and vibrates through your body.
Riding on the Belt Parkway recently, by the time i got home to Long Island, I was sick to my stomach from the ride.  Also does not handle well even on parkway, as it seems to wobble.
It also is noisy on the inside of the car when driving.
The voice recognition is not the best.
Very disappointed as I like the style, and setup of the car, but not the ride.  When I brought it in to have service manager drive it, he was in agreement with the hard ride.  Turns out one of the shock absorbers was leaking, but that did not make any difference when it was replaced.
Sorry to say, but this one has to go.\"
"09  3, 2016",Ada's review,"It's a very reliable car with a very smooth ride. The interior could be much better and not happy with the poor crash rating. Gas mileage could be much better, and the navigation system has limits, it won't accept all addresses."
"08 28, 2016",Most reliable crossover on the market,"This car is SUPER reliable. I have had zero issues with this vehicle and expect to drive it for many years to come. I live in the mountains and have taken this car on every terrain imaginable, and it performs every time. The quality on the interior certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but after trading in my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (w 28k miles), I know better than anyone that all the fancy features and comfort in the world do not make up for a mechanically unreliable vehicle. The Jeep was one problem after another, despite having only 28k miles.

In comparison, the Rav4 has needed nothing since the day I drove it off the lot. If some cheap details in the cabin are the worst thing about this SUV, then you know it's a good vehicle. Toyota did not cut corners where it counts with this vehicle (i.e. under the hood). Do NOT buy this car expecting a luxury ride or excellent features--buy this car because you want a vehicle that will get you where you need to go no matter what, and will last you 10+ years with minimal problems. Who cares if people think it's ""boring"" to drive? After my Jeep nightmare, I can tell you that it is WAY more boring to sit at a dealership for hours waiting for repairs!!

 When you start up the Rav you know you will get to your destination no matter what. At the end of the day, that's all I care about. If you're a buyer with similar priorities, you'll love the Rav4"
"08  8, 2016",never buy-- noisy Bluttooth and noisy drive,"unfortunately its not a good car to buy. very noisy drive on freeway and when you use car's Bluetooth on freeway, the other person thinks you car window is down. As per Toyota service manager its a built in technical fault and can not be fixed. 

I will suggest check this issue before buying."
"06 30, 2016",love it,"I purchased my Rav4 used.  I fell in love with it right away.  It handles well, turns great.  The A/C works great.  I wish the mirror adjustments, and the switches for the windows would light up at night.  I also think it is odd that I don't have automatic headlights.  My last car was a 2005 and it had automatic headlights.  That was disappointing. I love it anyway and would buy it again."
"06 18, 2016","good, not great, car","Body has  tight, solid feel to it.  Very easy and comfortable to drive and turning circle is small.  suspension fairly  stiff(l like that) rather than mushy. Very responsive to steering and brakes, really helped me avoid an accident.  Fantastic blind spot sensors and rear cross traffic sensors on Limited and great high beam auto dimmer as well.  Audio unit links pretty well and reliably with Moto-x phone.  Audio system sounds pretty decent on the Limited and has separate bass, mid , treble for each audio input type.  good lumbar support.  good interior room for class. absolutely great/powerful A/C.

cons:  lots of road noise at higher speed.  some areas of interior feel cheap and plasticky.  lots of rattling around the center console in cooler weather-very annoying.  only 3 band eq.  no usb folder browsing-very annoying.  accel just okay, would have been nice to have v6 option like they used to.  other aspects, like no illumination in the door lock controls, no homelink, no lights or reflectors  in the opened doors, etc., give the car a  low-end feel, even in the Limited.  Mileage I guess is about average for class, but gas tank seems really small, so I am refilling very often."
"05 22, 2016",A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"This car performs great but Toyota allows little things to make me think twice about it.
The window and mirror controls does not illuminate in the dark. USB just won't read folders unlike previous models including 2012 camry.
The cruise control is awkwardly placed , have to be looking down all the time.
USB READING FOLDERS IS MY BIGGEST HANGUP.
FIX IT TOYOTA !!!!!!!"
"04 29, 2016",Toyota no more,"Got Toyota due to its reliability ad. My big mistake. Expensive fixes at dealership match my 15 year old BMW expenses, but the frequency of it goes far beyond.
One thing for sure - Toyota advertisement worked."
"03 26, 2016",XLE 2015,"I have Toyota XLE 2015 and other than interior design, I'm really happy with it. It's very good in Gas and very reliable."
"02 14, 2016",Not the best car!,"I owned 4 Toyota cars before - 1 Corolla, 2 Camry, 1 RAV4. This is my 5th Toyota. Over the years Toyota quality has gone down. With this RAV4 2015, the interior is very dark specially in nights. The door lock / unlock, window roll-down lock, and mirror adjustment buttons are not lit. There is NO low-beam indicator on the dashboard. These are standard features in any other car. I asked the dealership to bring this to Toyota's attention. They refused to do it. Very disappointed with Toyota. This is my last one."
"02 12, 2016",Most reliable car I have owend.,I love my 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD I live in Nebraska and it does amazing in the winters here. It is very roomy and has plenty of rom for my grandchildren. I had a 2012 Ford Escape that I traded in because it had quite a few problems it started to jump some times when you hit the gas. I chose the Rav 4 because Toyota is very reliable. I LOVE MY RAV 4
"01 26, 2016",Nicest car I have ever owned,"First time I have ever got a vehicle with all the bells and whistles. Lane assist is amazing, had a neck fusion a few years ago. This helps me so much. I press a button on the steering wheel, a voice asks me what I want? I can change the channel on the radio, get directions, simply amazing."
"01  2, 2016",A quality car at a great price.,"I just purchased a new 2015 Toyota RAV4 and couldn't be more pleased. The car is very roomy for it's class. The car has a very tight + solid feel to it. The car looks great on the outside and the inside. The dash has a nice layout with all the controls within easy reach. I especially like the fact that the all wheel drive system, which is activated when the system detects wheel slippage, can be turned on manually when you are traveling in very slippery conditions provided you don't exceed 25 mph in the manually locked in mode.

I found the Toyota personnel including sales, management, vehicle service and clerical to be very pleasant and helpful. It was a very good buying experience. I highly recommend the RAV4."
"12 20, 2015",dim dashboard lights in the daylight,"I find that the dashboard light are dim in the daylight. When driving wearing sunglasses, I have problems seeing the odometer. I have to ride without wearing sunglasses in order to see how fast I'm going."
"12 16, 2015",Great on gas,So far I am concerned I am very pleased with the Rav 4 Limited. By buying the Limited we received things that we would have to pay for on other Rav 4's. Plenty of leg room both in the front and rear seats. Everything at your fingertips. You never need to take your hands off the wheel. The only thing that I think can be improved on is the size if the window where the radio and traffic is. It is hard to set up the nav trip because it is so small. But I love my Rave 4.
"12 10, 2015",Small Tank Capacity,"First off I'm satisfied with most things on my new 2015 Rav4. However I am very disappointed with the gas tanks fuel capacity. For the last 3 fill ups which I let go down to almost empty, I was only able to get between 46-48 Liters into the tank. I've addressed this issue with the dealer and Toyota Canada and both still think it is my faulty statistics that are wrong. I have documented through receipts and pictures as proof that that's all I'm able to get into the tank. They say continue to monitor. This is totally unacceptable given the specs say I should be able to get close to 60 L in the tank. As a result I'm filling up every week of my city commute. Anyone else having this issue???"
"12  1, 2015",toyota Rav 4,"I was overall impressed with this dealership at Hudiburg Toyota in MWC OK. My sales associate Greg Fanning was smart, honest, and detail oriented with everything that I wanted in my car. If he didn't know the answer than he would find the answer. He worked hard to give me the best price possible. I was very satisfied with the car that I purchased along with the customer service I received at the dealership. I would recommend this place along with Greg Fanning as the representative any day of the week!"
"11 15, 2015",My new RAV4,"My purchasing experience was excellent at Hudiburg Toyota. I just purchase a new car for me. My old 20 years old car broke, and I found a great deal and lots of help with Ralph Jones III.
At the dealership they guide me and advise on the choices that I had and they also informed me about the great benefits in all the options.
I appreciated all the help and the amazing that car that i have now, it is not also time to renovate but also to get something that fits my needs.

I am thankful to Hudiburg Toyota."
"11 14, 2015",Seems OK so far,OK but I would like less use of hard plastics and very low grade carpet. Some interior materials seem cheep. Macanicaly seems OK.
"11  8, 2015",love this car so far,"I just have this car for 2 months and I love it. Driving experience is smooth and comfortable. Rearview camera is very very helpful for parallel parking and backward parking. Well designed steering wheel make it so easy to control the audio system while you are driving-you can adjust everything with you thumb, even answer a call.
I always choose economic gas usage model so I spent almost the same gas money as I did on a Mazda protege before.
The only flaw so far is a little bumpy when you drive on a not-so-smooth surface. That's probably the problem for all SUVs."
"11  6, 2015",uncomfortable,"Front seats are ""NOT"" for bigger people. Drivers seat is too narrow for comfort. I am 6'2 and 230 lbs and made a big mistake buying a 2015 limited. Your right leg will ride on top of side buttress and if you go over 5 miles, you will be feeling it. Can't do anything about it now, just warn others. By the way, I love Toyota's- had a Camry before-wish I still had it. That's life. Oh, yes. if you are going from a regular car to an SUV, remember they are totally different beasts. Ride will be harsher, inside will be louder-think about it wisely."
"11  2, 2015",Perfect balance between luxury and utility,I have had 4 other Rav4's and this is the first Limited. Very nice vehicle with my only complaint being the somewhat narrow bucket seats. Nicely appointed and all the bells and whistles I could have wanted.
"11  2, 2015",NOT ALL IMPROVEMENTS ARE,"WITH 345000 MILES ON MY '99 RAV IT WAS TIME FOR NEW WHEELS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREAT 360 DEGREE WINDOW VISABILITY? THE BACK UP CAM DOES NOT COMPENSATE. INTERIOR - POORLY THOUGHT OUT. THE CUP WELLS SWALLOW THE CUPS. METAL TRIM STRIP IS SUN GLARING. WHY HIDE THE KEY IGNITION. USEFUL STORAGE IS HARD TO FIND / USE. WHY CANNT YOU DIM THE VIDEO SCREEN AT NIGHT (LIKE THE DASH LITES)? THANK GOODNESS THE '99 IS STILL IN THE DRIVEWAY. IT MAY TAKE ME TO 500,000 MILES YET"
"11  1, 2015",First Toyota,"I have had my RAV4 LE for 6 months and love everything about it except the black interior, everything seems to stick to it and it is hard to keep it looking clean. It is fun to drive, I have taken trips in it and it has done great and it is great for running around town in. This is my first Toyota, but it won't be my last."
"10 19, 2015",5K mile review,"So this is my 5th toyota I have owned through almost 19 years of driving. I have the 2015 Rav4 LE AWD model. I now have put on 5k miles through 6 months of ownership. The things I like about the vehicle: toyota reliability and dependability of course, nice acceleration, comfortable big seats, very generous leg room (front and rear), good trunk space, exterior styling, descent gas mileage (I get about 18.5 in the city and about 26 on the hwy.), and I love that it has a 6 speed automatic trans. Instead of the the CVT trans. Like the nissan rogue and honda cr-v. What I don't like about this vehicle: the seat fabric makes it challenging to keep extra clean, I would add a sunglass holder, I would make the front window sun visors to slide out for extra sun protection while driving, I would add a compass on the mirror for the LE model, instead of hub caps I would like alloy wheels, I would like splash guards to come with the vehicle, the Bluetooth does not always work, the doors seem really flimsy, especially the outside door handles, i would like the top of the front windshield to have a bit of tint to block some of the sun while driving, and I would like the front cup holders to be next to each other not a foot apart. This SUV may be a bit vanilla to most, but I take it for what it is: a company that built their good reputation throughout the years by making good quality cars that last a long time. So far no problems for me with this vehicle. I will add a review in years to come as the mileage piles up. Thanks!"
"10  3, 2015",Toyota RAV4: Great for short rides!,"Love my new Rav 4 Limited Edition. The 2 color leather seats are so stylish (Teracotta). So far (2 weeks) so good. However, IF YOU TAKE LONG DRIVES DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CAR. I took it on a LONG drive (5 hours each way) and felt like I was getting off of a horse when I arrived! My toosh was sore! The ""bucket seats"" really hug you -- too much. There's a lumbar support which I turned off to give me some relief. Thankfully I have the Limited edition with power seats which allow the driver to adjust the seats during the ride. Maybe it would be more comfy it you are really petite?
One other negative is that I found the leather seats hot on a long ride on a hot day. My lower back was sweaty! And I had the AC running on high! I'm guessing it's the leather snug seats? (never happened in my Camry LXE w/ leather seats). I love being up high\ which is a plus...This is a Small SUV inside, overall. I happen to like that, but if you're looking for a large SUV this isn't it. I drive this into NYC daily so didn't want a big car but did want to be HIGH up. I feel safe in this car! And the view is great! The front windshield is really wide! I have to get used to not having a trunk like I had in my Camry. I miss it. This has a nice hatch back area with a security shade. The seats in back go down very easily if you needed the room. I'm happy with it overall! We'll drive my husbands big car on long rides!"
"09 30, 2015",unimpressed,disappointed with performance and ride which is 90% of the reason for buying. test drive should have been longer. the more I drive the less I like it. Go for the limited version as the sound system in the xle sucks and no auto. button for the rear door sucks. There is really very little room to store things and even with seats down it fills up fast. Styling is nice and I'm hoping it handles well in the winter weather or I'll probably trade in and take a loss.
"09 26, 2015",Busy Mom,"I am very excited to own my new Toyota Rav4! It is a sporty yet classy vehicle. Previously I owned a Sequoia so I had some concerns with both the much smaller size and engine on the Rav4, however I am not disappointed at all. The Rav4 is more spacious on the inside then it looks on the outside. When I read reviews prior to my purchase others had mentioned problems with pick up and maintaining speed while going up hills. I have not found any of these problems to be true for me. In fact, on the contrary I am delighted with its performance. I frequently have to ramp onto dangerous and busy highways and have not had any concerns at all. I would strongly recommend this vehicle to others without hesitation."
"09 22, 2015",2015 RAV4 XLE,"2015 RAV 4 XLE is a vast improvement over the previous model. Prior to our 2015 we had a 2008 which was a good car but the styling, rear swing open tailgate and 4 speed transmission let it down. Our transmission would hut and violently downshift and upshift when going uphill at 65 MPH. We took it to the dealer for repair 3 times and they had no resolution. The mileage was also poor at 22 combined.
2015 PROS: 6 speed transmission like our 2013 Camry, Swing up lift gate, 28 mpg combined in eco mode, Back up camera. Touch screen, Driving range
CONS: Road noise higher than 2008 and MUCH Higher than in our Camry, Same fuel tank as Camry that shuts off at about 13GL. You can put 2 additional GL in both cars and increase range by 60 miles, Limited cubby/storage areas.
Overall the best choice and value in the category!!"
"09 21, 2015","Cute, but not so comfy","My first biggest complaint is the rock hard seats & uncomfortable road trip on my butt and back.
The engine idles loud.
The brake tends to be hard to keep down and constant pressure that it makes my foot cramp in rush hour traffic.
Lack of suspension, feels like the back end is going to drop out when hitting a small bump in the road or anything that is not a smooth surface.
The seats sit quite low, that I can't put my elbow on the door ledge to relax while driving.
The metal piece on top of dash is blinding when sun hits it, and you cannot read the clock if the sun is coming through the front windshield.
I have yet to get the GPS voice to work with my phone. If my bluetooth is on, I can't even hear the directions coming from my phone.
And I regret not getting power seats and power trunk.
I had a minivan that was 10 years old, that I can describe in two words...luxury ride!
I'm actually looking forward to selling it in about 15-18 months from now. I've already contacted my sales person and he's willing to help me out when that time comes....
I do many day trips, road trips and this car is not cut out for anything longer than a 30 minute drive to and from. I'm disappointed Toyota."
"09 10, 2015",BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN 30 YEARS,"HAD GREAT 2009 RAV4. TRADED IN FOR 2015 RAV
4. CANNOT DRIVE WITH LOW BEAMS AND SEE. LIKE DRIVING INTO BLACK WALL. HAD FOG I
LITES INSTALLED($400) SO COULD SEE ON LOW BEAMS. LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM. TEST DRIV AT NITE OUT OF TOWN AND YOU WONT BUY THIS MODEL. WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BULB CREATING THIS PROBLEM. BACKUP SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN IN SUNLITE, NO LOCKING GLOVE BOX, NO SUNGLASS STORAGE OVER DASH, NO DUAL CONSOLE STORAGE,NO DUAL GLOVE BOX, SMALLER SIDE VIEW MIRRORS. CANNOT COMMENT ON MILAGE AS ONLY HAVE 400 MILES ON IT. CONTACTED TOYOTA ANG GOT BLOWN OFF. VERY POOR CONSUMER RELATIONS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE. BE BETTER OFF WITH A CHEAPER MODEL OR MAKE."
"09  4, 2015",Fantastic SUV.,"Very comfortable with lots of room.

Unbelievable gas mileage, can not wait to drive it in the snow plus we got a super deal. We are very happy
With this vehicle."
"08 31, 2015",Best Car transaction ever,"I love my new car and the expedited ""buying time"" my dealer gave me. Everyone was respectful, listened to us, and answered all our questions. Excellent transaction."
"08 29, 2015",It's a good and reliable vehicle,"This is my second Rav4. Purchased the XLE trim this time. Traded in a 2010 Limited with a V6. Overall I'm happy with the vehicle. The sale price and 0% financing made it a logical choice without breaking the bank. Only reason I traded the 2010 was because it was FWD and I needed AWD.

Pros:
Interior space with back seats down
Eco, Normal and Sport mode choices and good fuel economy
Excellent crash tests and safety results
Relatively quiet ride, good visibility
AWD in the snow
Toyota quality and high residual value

Cons:
Weak lumbar support which can get uncomfortable on long drives
Fabric armrests on doors can show dirt easily
Small capacity fuel tank"
"08 19, 2015",Speedometer inaccuracy,"My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership. An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy. The warranty is 36,000 miles. That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty. Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300. Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer. I went through arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement on July 8, 2015. I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications. In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening. In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.
Otherwise the vehicle operates fine. However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers. I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device. It is definitely underpowered. Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy. Bluetooth doesn't always work. Great for hauling stuff. Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there."
"08 11, 2015",Best driving car I have owned,"I Love my new RAV4, and so do my Grandchildren who are 12 and 11. They like the room and the ease of getting their things out of thee back when we are just going a short distance. They think all the gadgets as they call them are COOL."
"08  7, 2015",best overall exceptional price,"Styling and price beyond comparison in its category and class. Human functionality fluid and above average. I am a large man and find the vehicle to be tight to get in and out of. There also seems to be a great deal of engine and road noise. These 2 factors are minor when considering all amenitys, standard options, and overall drivability of the vehicle. Recommend the Forerunner for anyone over 6'2 or 270 lbs. It was a very good fit. I still greatly enjoy the rav4 though."
"07 30, 2015",Not my best buy,"I traded in an older RAV for a 2015 LE model and I regret having done so. Incredibly the older RAV handled far better and the engine noise was quieter. The LE model doesn't come with fog lights and the black fillers make the vehicle look very tacky. The 2015 RAV acceleration is fair at best and the handling is far from special. Overall the 2015 Rav seems functional but functional is the kindest thing I can call it. It looks and drives like vehicle that should sell for several thousand dollars less. This is my third Toyota Rav and it's also my last one. I would gladly swap it for a competitor's model if I could. Pretty much any competitor. If you're determined to purchase a 2015 Rav, I strongly urge you to at least avoid the entry level LE model. It's somewhat cheaper and the slightly lower price is self evident in the vehicle itself."
"07 20, 2015",BlueTooth System is TERRIBLE!!!,"Bought a new car and the sales experience was incredibly bad- we were basically held hostage and not allowed to leave to eat. After 5 hours and 2 mistakes with the paperwork, we left. The Bluetooth system is very poor and no one can hear me when I call using it on the car. I have had it back to Toyota 3 times and they indicate it is my problem - not the car. this is my 4th new Toyota and will likely be my last as they don't want to fix the problem and most people believe it is the microphone. Buying a new car should be fun and exciting but not this time. I recommend you look to other companies due to the problems with the software and if hands-free is required in your state, this system is horrible."
"07 18, 2015",bought Toyotas for past sixteen years,I trust the Toyota product very happy with my choice. The city here gets a lot of rain and i like the little higher vehicle. Also I am tall and more comfortable getting in and out of this size vehicle. I love the interior all the accessories are easily accessible and right where I am accustomed to. It has a back up camera which I have learned to love for safety. I enjoy the seats folding flat for carrying larger items. The back door makes loading groceries easier and not as much stretch and bending. Appreciate the help with knowing prices thanks.
"07  2, 2015",Best of the three Toyota's I've owned.,"The RAV4 has a great sound system and handles like a dream. I've been to Geargia two times in the safest and most comfortable SUV It handles great, sight line is excellent, smooth transition of the gears good on gas."
"06 22, 2015",A Review of My 2014 Toyota Rav 4,"This comment applies to all Toyotas I have seen, but especially my 2014 Rav 4, which has black fabric seats.

The materials Toyota uses for fabric seats have never been particularly well chosen (from a design, look and feel standpoint).

My 2014 Rav 4 is a really terrific car in all ways but one - it has black fabric seats, and the fabric looks, and feels cheap, and is impossible to keep clean especially from pet hair (even when pets have never set foot in the car). The fabric is far more problematic than the fabrics in my 2012 and 2010 Ravs, although these were not stellar either by any means (just not like Velcro).

Toyota would do well to take a look at the fabrics used to upholster Honda CRV interiors, which look and feel far superior, and which do not function like Velcro for pet hair and similar stuff. It is the one major design flaw in the vehicle (looks like the 2015s are much the same!), and, it's so annoying, my next car my well have to be the Honda CRV instead."
"06 16, 2015",2015 Toyota Rav4 XLE.,"Though overall I like the vehicle, I was disappointed with 3 things that I thought were standard in XLE models (this is not basic model):

1) Does not have auto seat adjust.
2) Does not have lumbar support.
3) Does not have auto headlights.

Drive is very comfortable and could have few additional bells & whistle as blind spot indicator."
"06 11, 2015",First week down and I'm thrilled,"I was looking to replace my minivan with something smaller and more efficient but with large seating areas. I cannot believe how big the rear seat area is, even with the front seats all of the way back. The RAV4 sits higher than the typical economy sedan like a Corolla or Civic, so getting the kids in and out is much easier. This would likely also apply to seniors.
The car also drives very nicely. I cannot believe other reviews mention that it is underpowered. My FWD LE seems to scoot quite well. I also really like how the 6 speed auto transmission always seems to be in the right gear at the right time.
The thing about other makes is that when you get a base model the interior really looks like it. The base level LE RAV4 looks like a quality car from inside and out. The interior is beautiful, but oddly has mabye 5 or 6 different materials and textures. I am averaging 24+ MPG tooling around town so far, but have yet to take a long highway drive to test highway mileage.
I really am impressed with the integrated stereo/bluetooth phone controls/backup camera setup. Again, a base car with top line features. Stereo sound is very good IMO, especially in CD mode.
If you want a car that is small outside but very large and comfortable inside the RAV4 should be considered. For the price paid it can't be beat."
"05  6, 2015",Interior features not as good as our former 2007 R,"Short comings of Interior Design (vs 2007 RAV4)
Some panel light not lit without the lights being on
(requires turning on lights well before needed)
No place to store glasses or sunglasses
(In the 2007 RAV4 there was room for 3 pairs)
Not as many places to store misc small things (1 vs 2)
Console between seats lacks space for storage of
small, flat items, as was present on the 2007 RAV4.
The extra glove compartment of the 2007 RAV4 is now
only a shelf on the dashboard.

Even the 2007 RAV4 lacked storage space for flat materials such as maps, so they will continue to be stuffed between the seat and the center console."
"04 21, 2015",Great car,"I recently bought a 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD , and I love it. The color I picked is Barcelona Red and everyone that sees it thinks its a beautiful color. Does it ride like a luxury SUV? No but still, it rides smoother than a lot of small suv on the road. In short, I would recommend the rav 4 if you are looking for a small SUV with class and at a great price."
"04 13, 2015",Again,I have enjoyed my 14 year old Rav4 so much that I bought another one. Can't beat a good thing. So far so good.
"04 11, 2015","Toyota to the T, not for me","I ended up in a fender bender the other week and needed my vehicle repaired. I drive a 2010 Hyundia Electra. The only reason why I purchased this vehicle is the MPG's as I was driving 84 miles one way to work. When the economy was really bad back in 2011 I was desperate.

Anyway, this is an good vehicle, but sort of disappointed. For all of the hoopla of that Toyota's are exemplary vehicles to drive I just don't get it. They do drive pretty good, nice seating position, seats are decent but nothing to write home about. I had the AWD and experienced OK gas mileage. When I was on the highway I experienced roughly 27-29 MPG which isn't half-bad for AWD. As soon as I get to stop and go traffic I saw my fuel gauge drop. It has enough pep to merge with traffic but not enough to do any inspiring driving.

I guess that's just it. It does well enough on everything but nothing to say ""Wow I can't wait to drive this thing"". It was more or less ""I can't wait to get home"". I mean it's not a bad CUV but I can name a plethora of CUVs that I would look into getting prior to getting this. Maybe the Lexus version is more inspiring I would imagine.

Some months ago I test drove a 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4 cylinder in Louisiana. It was your standard front wheel drive mid range (latitude I believe) and I feel that it was more inspiring to drive this CUV.

The best way to describe it is to compare it to MR or MRS reliable. Their not bad and they get the job done just don't expect anything more."
"04  4, 2015",disappointed,"The seats are uncomfortable, rough ride, rigid frame and every pot hole, or bump in the road sends a jolt to the passenger's. Gas mileage sucks."
"04  1, 2015",Beware of salesman claiming blue tooth capability,"Just bought a new RAv 4- switched from an Altima. Was promised a hands free blue tooth system. Which is true as long as the only thing you want to do is make phone calls similar to the function of an old flip phone. Texting function has no voice recognition so you have to read and select pre-selected messages. When the salesman explained that unless i wanted to upgrade ($8,000.00 ) for the top line model, I would not have GPS on the car. I though fine. My abdroid phone will do that and if I have blue tooth. Im good. But the car will not let the phone do that at least not thru the speakers. I either have to spend time reprograming the system everytime I want to use a map app (not something that is hands free and I have to stop the car) or unpair the phone and not be able to get phone calls thru bluetooth. They suggested I should buy a new phone. Verizon guys assumed the car was before 2008--the programing was so simple (AND CHEAP FOR TOYOTA) also that a new phone would not fix the programing in the car. And every time you turn the car off it goes back to the default setting that plays all my ringtones like a playlist and then has map lady in background talking softly. The volume control needs to be VERY LOUD for the map app and will blast you on all other audio.

Also mileage is not as listed best is 27 not 31 mpg (with coasting down all hills and reduced speed. and worst is 18 not 22."
"03 29, 2015",NIce Car,Would recommend this vehicle for anyone driving a lot of miles but needs some space.Great for getting around in traffic or crowed parking lots.
"03 23, 2015",NEW 2015 RAV4 XLE,"Just replaced a 2014 RAV4 XLE that was totaled in an accident with a 2015 RAV4 XLE. Only difference was color change from Shoreline Blue Pearl to Super White. Great little CUV, no issues with year old unit in the 10k miles of ownership. This is my 10th Toyota and all have performed excellently. Strongest resale value of any small SUVs."
"03 15, 2015",Most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"Purchased 2015 Toyota RAV4
Pros - All wheel drive is excellent for our snowy Wisconsin winters
Cons ?Installing a very stiff suspension system to make it seem like it has sportier handling has produced an extremely harsh, rough ride with even the littles bumps creating a sharp jolt to the passengers.
--Toyota also decided to sacrifice driver comfort for anyone over 6? by:
1- Not allowing the seat to move back far enough and the driver to decide how much room to leave for the back seat passenger even though there is a lot of extra room behind it when no one is in the back seat. This keeps a taller persons knees against the dash and the cruise control to hit your leg.
2 -Only way to sit is with seat in reclining position making it impossible to maintain correct posture and avoid back problems.
3-Jamming the seat belt receiver clip below the seat bottom as well as being sandwiched tightly between the seat and center counsel rather than having it project above the seat so it can be used.
4-Unusable sun visor is recessed into the ceiling without any wide spot in the ceiling to grab and lower it.
5-Slush and salt builds up on inside bottom of the doors in winter driving regions. This increases rusting possibilities and falls off in the garage or on a person?s lower legs as you exit the vehicle.
6 -Difficult entry for tall person due to sharp sloping roof line.
7-Ridges on top of front fenders make it impossible to judge where outside edges of front fenders are. Terrible to park and drive in town."
"02 20, 2015",Well designed reliable nimble and sharp to look at,"We bought the Toyota based on the extreme reliability we enjoyed with our previous 2009 Toyota Camry. The Camry was driven 165000 miles including severe winter weather with salt and snow covered roads common to Vermont. When we traded the Camry it still looked and drove great. It was on its second set of brake pads. The original set was replaced at 110000 miles. The rotors were fine. The only repair item needed was a water pump at 125000 miles. We always used synthetic oil. The engine stayed clean and ran like new.

If the Rav 4 is as reliable as the Camry we will be happy.
We went with the Rav 4 because of the extra cargo capacity and all wheel drive. It's s very comfortable car to drive on the highway. Gas milage is around 25-27 mpg so far. Six speed transmission is smooth and is always in the right gear for each driving condition. We especially like the push button keyless ignition that came with the limited edition."
"02  2, 2015",smaller,I aqm pleased with the new Rav4. I have some problems with the location of controls such as cruise control. Lots of whistle and gadgets to distract a driver. Communication with the sales person after the sale has been a problem. Part of the deal was a trailer hitch. We purchased the vehicle on 6 Jan 2015. the hitch still needs a wiring harness. Way to long to complete the installation.
"01 28, 2015",Stylish and fun,"I love the style, the interior, backup camera, navigation system, sound system, handlingPlus there is a lot of room inside and in the back,. The only thing missing I wished that it had is where you can program it for your garage door opener. If it has that I haven't found it yet."
"01 25, 2015",great car,Love every thing abou this car except hard to understand how to set up the radio etc . Speaker blue tooth is dificult for people to understand me.
"01 10, 2015",not a bad ride...,"I do not agree with the writer that was comparing his V6 limited Rav4 with this one... its like comparing the old style Rav4 with the 4 cylinder with the V6 model... two totally different vehicles.. MOST people that are buying a smaller SUV are buying it to get them higher off the ground than a sedan, easier access to and better storage and the availability of 4 wheel drive... I had a V6 Rav4 as well, and it was way too powerful for that size of a vehicle... I now have a 2013 Rav4 and its great at doing what it was made for... I lug two 16 year old boys to away hockey tournaments all the time in it, with two adults in the front... and the dashboard is perfectly placed, simple to use and works well... I'm 6'3"", 240 lbs and I have no problem getting in or out of this vehicle and quite comfortable in it for long drives... I will say that the 2009 Rav4 I had, was of a bit better quality (plastics, etc) but for what I paid, I like this mid size SUV..."
"01  8, 2015",Poorest suv i've ever had,Wish i had not bought this RAV4...i have bought the Honda CR-V and is perfection...this is a poor design SUV and with the poorest client service
"12  7, 2014",Not recommended,It is just a nice try. 4 cylinder engine is not performing at all. Currently I have a 2012 V6 limited and I am extremely happy with the car. I test drive one 2015 4 Cylinder fully loaded one. It was a big frustration new RAV4 is NOT performing on the road at all. If you like to have a car can deal with the winter conditions like me I suggest to think twice to buy new RAV4
"11 14, 2014","nice car ,toyota brakes","first Toyota I've owned-roomy inside, great view of road. braking is only thing I don't like- car feels like it accelerates when you are braking. Specialist checked and stated this is normal for a Toyota, says it is safe-just feels a bit unnerving to have car ""accelerate"" when you are braking. wish breaking was smoother."
"11 10, 2014",Smart and Stylish Reliable Car,"The car as beautifuly stylish as smart. Considering that's a pretty big car I highly recommend to buy TechPackage if you want to save time, nerves and skip guessing (especially going back).
Depending on your road conditions you can choose Sport, Eco (economical) or normal Drive Mode. Most time I use Eco Mode because like I said that's a pretty big car!.
One more benefit - Moon Roof: you may add some fresh air with less noise and polution from a road. And there is plenty of room for 5 people. I LOVE MY NEW CAR !"
"11  1, 2014",Best deal in town,"Received the best deal in town at Hendrick Toyota of Merriam kansas. Worked with me to make sure I was completely satisfied with my deal. Pleasant & friendly. Would recomend you purchase your next car. I worked with Jennifer Vinson, Jeff Breaux and Robert Biehl."
"10 26, 2014",Wonderful car,"My new 2015 RAV4 Limited replaces my 2004 RAV4 Limited. The new car is much bigger than the old one. It is nearly as big as my 2005 Highlander. The car rides firmly but comfortably. The engine power could be stronger but it is adequate. The navigation system has made several minor errors but no system is 100% accurate. I've been averaging about 24 mpg for combined local and highway driving. The back-up camera with cross traffic alert, the blind spot monitors and the lane departure alert are very welcome and useful features. The JBL sound system is excellent. There is plenty of storage space in the cabin, but I miss the small draw in the dash of my old RAV4 that I used to hold coins for parking meters. The placement of the vanity mirror light in the ceiling rather than on the visor provides better lighting. I also like the power lift gate. It is much more convenient than the old horizontally opening door with the spare mounted on it. The spare is now out of the way under the floor of back cargo area."
"12  5, 2017","Best most reliable car I've ever,ever owned!!","Where do I start it has everything I need such as all wheel drive when I need it , roomy for the family nice big back to put many things comfortable in the back!!! It's a Toyota need I say too much more, they are reliable for the long haul and that's what you want when you work hard for your living!!! I've had Toyotas in the past and they have gone and gone beautifully!!! This RAV4 suites and meets my every need and Toyota is where I'm staying all the way always!!!!!!  Sooooooo Happy!!!!!!"
"12  2, 2017",Greatest car I?ve ever owned,"This car is amazing! I went from a small 2004 Toyota Camry to this 2015 Toyota RAV4. And I?m not disappointed! I have enough room for the whole family, including the dogs. We are able to tow our jet ski with it which was a must have for me. It is easy to drive and park (I suck at pulling into parking spots if there?s people on either side because I get nervous) so it?s been great for me. The touch screen radio and backup camera are great. The backup comes in handy when needing to hook up the jet ski. My fiancee and I even took this car deer hunting and it drove through gravel and fields just fine. The gas mileage was great while making the five hour drive home from when we picked it up. I believe it was around 34mpg. My fiancee is also a mechanic, so he will NOT let me buy any sort or motorized equipment without him thoroughly looking it over. The RAV4 got his approval right away. He said it was safe and reliable and that we will be able to drive this car for another 15-20 years. Very happy that this is the car we went with as I wanted a Jeep. Glad my fiancee and family talked me out of it."
"12  1, 2017",Great Car,"Performs as well as any car I have ever owned including sports cars.  Great performance either in city or highway.  enjoy the styling, comfort and accessories.  This car has it all."
"11 28, 2017",Excellent handling and comfort,"2015 Toyota RAV4 handles well and offers a smooth ride. I just traded up from 2009 Rav4, which had more storage and hiding spaces. I really prefer the side hinged door to the upper lift"
"11 26, 2017",Good so far,"I just bought this vehicle a couple weeks ago, it works very well so far. Although, a message popped up saying it needed maintenance, that?s an easy fix, I hope."
"11 26, 2017",The most reliable car I?ve ever owned,The reason I bought this car was because of it?s performance and reliability I like the exterior styling and the comfortable interior design
"11 22, 2017",Amazing size as style,I love the ease of driving it. It's a safe and reliable car on the road and has a nice and roomy interior.
"11 21, 2017",Vehicle Review,"Safe, wonderful family vehicle. Love the navigation and features that this vehicle has. I needed something that would help me feel safe on long trips back East to see family"
"11 20, 2017",Great suv strongly recommend to anyone great on ga,Comfy stylish roomy radio speakers good bluetooth..has crusise control nice car for the price ..nice
"11 10, 2017",So far so good!,"Reliable!!!  Looks nice.  Love the all wheel drive!  Roomy with lots of space!  Love the back up scree
N"
"11  9, 2017",Wonderful car!,"All Toyota are great cars, but the Rav4 is perfect for me. I work about 40 minutes away from home so, I am on the road a lot. I feel very safe in my Rav. Having a compact SUV is nice because you have a lot of room inside without feeling like you are driving a spaceship."
"11  6, 2017","Love Toyota?s anyway, but this car drives so nice.","Drive 3 teens to school each day with 3 big backpacks, fits everyone and everything great. Rains a lot in this state and I feel very safe in it,. Love the backup camera also."
"11  3, 2017",My Car,"I purchased this from a dealer. Owned it for a year and drove all type of roads. I could transport the items that i thought it won't fit. No regrets in having this car. 

Amazing Car !"
"11  2, 2017",Reliable car,"This car was a great AWD vehicle. I enjoyed driving it.Very comfortable. The gas tank is a little smaller than most cars but avg MPG was around 24-26. I've been told the Bluetooth sound while calling others had a ""tinny"" sound."
"10 25, 2017",Great Vehicle,This car meets all of my needs as of now. Of course I would have liked to have climate control and moon roof but those are not necessities. Its spacious enough for a family of four and everyone loves it. The mileage could improve a little but I think its still much better than other SUVs in the market.
"10 21, 2017",Great Car,"As a previous owner, we were delighted to test drive this vehicle.  In fact, we bought it.  An upgrade for us include rear camera.  We are so excited!"
"10 19, 2017",A great car at a good price,This is a great car for the working man or women. Although its small in size it has plenty of room for a big guy.  Love the back up camera and blue tooth.  you will be amazed at the performance and turning radius of this Toyota RV 4.
"10 17, 2017",Needed something with a little more space.,This car appears to be large enough to meet my needs.  More space for my golf equipment and dog kennel.
"10 15, 2017",Great car for it's value! Very fun!,This car is great for it's value! Very fun to go off road in road trips. Pretty spacious and comfortable and the cargo size is neat too. Couple of people complained about the performance. Of course this is not a performance heavy vehicle but I had no problems with it during the snow and going a bit off road.
"10  7, 2017",Toyota Rav4 Totally Reliable,"The car is roomy, comfortable, mechanically reliable, good on gas.  It  short coming for me are storage related. The arm rest moves when you lean on it, and there are no innovative storage locations like you'd find in a Jeep Cherokee Latitude under the seat or in the rear of the SUV."
"10  5, 2017",Descent Car with a few flaws,"The 2015 Toyota Rav 4 is a reliable car, but does have some flaws that I believe Toyota could've done better with. First lets start off with the Steering. Sensitivity of the steering  is just outrageous. It is too sensitive to a point where changing lanes could easily make you side-swipe another vehicle. Then comes road noise. I believe more sound dampening materials could've been added to the vehicle to block more noise. Other than that, this is a great reliable vehicle."
"10  2, 2017",It?s the perfect suv for the family,"The RAV4 is good SUV very Reliable, Spacious, very good torque and power for Four-cylinder engine more than you need for your family SUV. Value for the money is great. The only think I don?t like about it is when you drive on the highway the car is loud it?s not Isolated perfectly so there is always a wend sound on the highway and the engine is loud too.Stability is perfect and visibility is one of the best on the market for the category."
"10  1, 2017","Very reliable, and great on gas","This car is very reliable. THe interior is very spacious, and when the back seats are lowered, it hauls almost anything.  The gas mileage surprised me for an all wheel drive vehicle.  When we put winter tires on it, It became a tank in the winter.  It pushes through the snow better than my truck.  Great all around vehicle.  I Love it."
"10  1, 2017",Love my 2015 RAV4!!! (Later Release),"This car has way better MPG than advertised. Also, looks very nice and it?s is quite comfortable. I took it off the road and it was a beast. Great car for the money you pay!"
"09 27, 2017","Great Deal, Seamless Purchasing Process","After reviewing competitive pricing online for Toyota RAV4's for cost perspective, we visited this dealer with our wish list and were immediately taken to a spotless 2015 RAV4 with unbelievably low mileage.  We would describe the car as ""barely driven"".
Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.   
What we thought would be a stressful search for a ""new"" car turned out to be anything but stressful. 
Steve Skolnick, our salesman, was happy and we were happy after a short transaction.  
We love the car and our pleasant sales experience!"
"09 26, 2017",Loving my RAV4 2015,"RAV4 does not need a review because it is prooved to be one of the best vehicles within 30K.  Very comfortable from the first ride.  I had a chance to drive 2017 and 2015.  I chose 2015 as a better value.  I like bigger side mirrors so you could see a few lanes around.  I almost do not need to use rear mirror.  In 2017 they messed with side mirrors, they are smaller, but 2017 has new fixtures like brake assist and cruise control assist.  It is really something to consider"
"09 26, 2017",Most reliable with style and compfort,"This car gives all u need in your car like style size and sefty mileage looks reliablety with confidence,and wourth of investment"
"09 25, 2017",Most practical and comfortable car I've owned,"This car is great on gas, reliable in the winter and comfortable for taking long trips. It is also practical for all kinds of activities since it has a roof rack and plenty of space in the back. It is stylish and compact so it is a great transition for those used to driving smaller cars."
"09 23, 2017",About my RAV4,Very nice SUV for the $ but get the 4WD instead of 2WD if you use it in snow prone winters.  Mine didn't make it up the hill to my house 1 night and cost me a tow to get home
"09 19, 2017",1st new car owned and love it,"So happy with my Toyota RAV4   -  I proud to drive my Toyota, great car and Great gas milage ! 
Only wish it had more little compartments to put things in ."
"09 18, 2017",Amazing car for the price!,This car is reliable. Great for the price and looks nice. Definitely better than the CR-V in my opinion. It just feels nicer and more sporty.
"09 15, 2017",Very nice for a smaller suv,I think it is perfect for the price. I think they all need a sunroof though! It drove great and the ride was pretty smooth.
"09  9, 2017",Very reliable,"I am a college student and I don't live on campus, I commute. This car is perfect because it does not give me any trouble. I drive about 400-500 miles a week for work and school, so this is it guys, if you are looking for something reliable!"
"09  4, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"I like the styling, gas mileage is okay to good for the class, Toyota reliability.   Drives fine, a slight sport feel."
"09  2, 2017",Love my car!,Traded my 2008 Rav4 limited for a 2015 RAV4 limited. Loved my 2008 and love my 2015. Great comfort and leg room. Fun to drive! Great car.
"08 31, 2017",It's a good car.,"It's similar to Honda CR-V; acceleration was not as good as a compatible CR-V, even though RAV4 has slightly larger engine (2.5L vs. 2.4L)."
"08 27, 2017",Toyota: #1 in our book,"The 2015 RAV  we just replaced with a new RAV was an amazing vehicle.....So was its predecessor , the Matrix,......... we are certain our new RAV will be just as loved.   The way these vehicles handle is great...... you can ""turn on a dime"".   They are super reliable.....good in any weather or road conditions.  They look good and drive even better. ...Unbeatable!"
"08 24, 2017",Most reliable car I ever owned,Eye catching  exterior design.  Very reliable  and have  good gas mileage.  Like the E-tune sound system.
"08 16, 2017",Looks and runs great,"I am an Uber driver, good size back seat and trunk space. Great maneuverable and acceleration.Very good gas mileage."
"08 14, 2017",BRILLIANY!,Great visibility and safety features are awesome. Large back up  view camera. Stylish and comfortable.
"08 14, 2017",Best purchase ever made!!!,I absolutely love my RAV4! I previously owned a 2005 Dodge Neon SXT and loved it but this RAV4 is much more reliable and just my style!!!
"08 12, 2017",Excellent SUV for the money!,"This is my favorite vehicle to drive. It drives and handles like a car. Compared to my 2012 Chevy Sonic, which is a small car, it is very nimble and quick. Brakes are excellent no worries there. Would definitely recommend the All Wheel Drive (AWD) addition, seems to have a little more pep. I love that you can choose your driving type by the push of a button (Economy, Sport). Great Job Toyota!"
"08  8, 2017",Love the handling of this car,Excellent in the winter.  Very easy to park and drive it is very dependable and it is just a great car

"08  1, 2017",Luv my new ride!,"My 2015 RAV4 Ltd ROCKS!  This vehicle is awesome! It is easy to drive and comfortable.  It has  an excellent backup camera, cross traffic warning, AWD, lane departure warning, navigation, blind spot monitoring, blue tooth, and on and on and on.   I traded in my Toyota Highland Hybrid for this SUV and I couldn't be happier with my decision."
"07 31, 2017",Love my new Rav4,"Just bought this car last week so this is  based on a short time frame, but so far I LOVE this car.  Great interior- tons of space and very comfortable.  Not as great of gas mileage as I had anticipated, but I have to drive in traffic every day so that's not unexpected.  Love the body style, love the details inside.  Very pleased with this purchase.  Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small SUV!  Feels like a huge upgrade from my 1999 Subaru Forester. ;)"
"07 31, 2017","Quality, performance & reliability","I love this AWD SUV, I added a brush guard to mine, it has been flawlessly reliable. 
The one touch seat folding is great, it has a lot of space in the back. 
It's great on gas, comfortable seats, perfect height to see clearly on the road, super easy to park, I love the back up camera with the wide angle lens, the all weather mats are perfect."
"07 30, 2017",Toyota reliability & performance,"This car is an example of value for money without the pricey gimmicks.
Toyota is the most reliable brand I have ever owned and this vehicle has been proved to out perform Honda."
"07 26, 2017",As reliable as American Cars used to be.,This is an excellent car and is extremely reliable and easy to learn how to use all it's features.  I challenge square dance and sometimes travel hundreds of miles to dance.  At least 5 of my dancing friends have RAV4's and they also swear by them!
"07 23, 2017",Love My RAV !,"I simply love this SUV. Decent gas mileage, comfortable, solid construction.  I bought the RAV4 XLE with cargo cross bars, remote rear tailgate, premium stereo with NAV AND REARVIEW camera."

"07  9, 2017",Solid Vehicle,I purchased this vehicle based on my experience with Toyota products. Very reliable.  It also fit my needs of having a usable back seat and room for dogs in the hatch.
"07  6, 2017",2015 Toyota RAV4 LIMITED,"Comfortable, Reliable, safe, Great value, holds 5 passengers and lots of room for things in the back. Good MPG city and road. Air conditioner second to none I ever owned. steering, braking, sure footed.  Excellent re-sale value. Give it a rating of 9 out of 10 on a *soft ride* Navigator is wonderful.  My Toyota dealer is great!"
"07  5, 2017",A smooth ride!,"My husband and I test drove this car, but after some discussion, we decided to buy another car at this dealership. It was a hard choice between this car and a Subaru, but we are happy with our final decision."

"07  5, 2017",I love it!,"This is a wonderful vehicle!  Good gas mileage and very peppy!  No lag when you step on the gas.  I have the limited with the tech package, so I have the blind spot alert (very nice!) and the lane departure warning.  Back up camera with cross path detection is great also, especially when your backing out of a parking spot in a busy parking lot and you cant see around the vehicles next to you.  I also like that I can turn on the AWD full time when I chose to."
"07  4, 2017",A great car to drive,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 and I like the Rav 4 a lot and will continue to own Toyotas and will brag on how great they are. The car is comfortable, great on gas, long drives and around town."

"06 29, 2017",A very sensible care,Very capable car that can get you from point A to point b. It handles well on city streets and on the highways. Plenty of room for hauling moderately sized items; leg room adequate for an above average height person.
"06 29, 2017",RAV 4 is the best Mid SUV investment you can make,"I researched cars for days on end. Looking for the most bang for my buck, since cars cost a lot of bucks. The Honda CR-V is popular and reliable but the drive was too fluffy feeling, not much power or control. The Mazda CX-5 was very impressive, but the RAV 4 just took the prize. It drives exceptionally well for an SUV and looks amazing. The reliability is off the charts and feels so safe to drive. It is by far THE Best Mid Size SUV on the market."
"06 29, 2017",comfortable car and economical driving,"the car price is very reasonable. after almost 2 years driving, the average MPG is 25. It is safe and comfortable vehicle. the space inside is enough for four person, including a car seat. And the storage room is also enough for family use."
"06 18, 2017",I love this car it's confot when you are driving,What I love for this car is  you will not use a lot gas and also is comfort when your driving Toyota is the number one preferred car
"06 16, 2017",I love the roominess in my  SUV,"We love this vehicle, but we do miss a couple things that we feel should have been on this vehicle since it was so expensive. Like on my Mazda 6 it had an alarm and a light come on the side mirrors to alarm you of cars in the other lane. We miss that. And the inside controls like window locks etc. lite up at night."
"06 13, 2017",A Split Decision,"The Wife loves this vehicle. She drives it in town. I don't love this vehicle. I drive it on highways.
We like the roomy, versatile, and comfortable interior. The gas mileage predictions are fairly accurate. It makes it up our steep Minnesota driveway with ease.  Maneuvers into a tricky garage better than others we tried. Styling isn't a big deal to us, but it looks like every other crossover on the road.
The bottom two inches of the inside of the front doors is outside so road slush builds up on them. Stupid and messy. Gas tank only allows a range of about 360 miles. Not enough. No interior storage. Adequate power in flatlands. Gutless in mountains. I have not been able to detect any difference between Sport/Eco modes. There is a problem with the driver seat/ steering wheel relationship. With seat pushed back the ""telescoping"" wheel is too far away (and I have long arms). On snow and ice it likes to obey the laws of inertia and continue in a straight line when you're trying to make it turn. Two years in I'm afraid it's going to last forever. Good thing the Wife likes it."
"06 13, 2017",A beautiful donkey,"I am reading all sort of stuff here about this car.I own a 2013 rav 4 .not comfortable????Are you kidding me?Not fast?Buy a Ferrari...Not stylish?Go get a Pontiac Aztec....Just kidding.
I tell you what.For the price ,the XLE model is the bargain of the century.As for performance is probably the best compromise ever.Buy the 4x4 if you live in a snowy state,buy the xle instead of the le model,and make yourself a favour and get rubber mats.Change the oil and filters as recommended and don t abuse it off road because is not a 4 runner or a highlander.Also,please don t put your stinky feet on the dashboard,don t eat a whole buffet while driving,and don t put your stupid dog on the front passenger seat...Even the rav 4 is not built for that..."
"06 12, 2017",Smooth!,"I was driving a Jeep and got addicted to being up a little off the ground like a regualr car.  Though our Jeep was about the same size, the design is great and lots of leg room for both the front and back seats.  The head room feels great and I love the safety features."
"06  7, 2017",Well worth the price,"This SUV was perfect for me. I could fit my three cocker spaniels in the back seat, the drive was smooth, and it maneuvered easily through main highways. I easily fit in normal parking spaces, the vehicle was excellent when I was in a rear end collision and protected me. My biggest disappointment was that because all the airbags deployed it was a loss."
"06  6, 2017",Much improved from the 2010 model,"REally enjoy driving this car, plenty of room and great gas mileage and plenty of room to carry cargo"
"06  4, 2017",Awsome car i have owend,"This car is perfect that i expected. This car is so comfortable. I recomend some peole who are looking for perfect car buy this car. And, i think it was resonable price for me"
"06  3, 2017",good small car,"good for short drives  wheel base to short  for smooth ridegood gas milage ,not enough cargo space good car for the money"
"06  3, 2017",Very cheap upolstery used on the seats,"I have owned Toyota vehicles for over 20 years, so when I decided to lease a 2015 Rav4, I was optimistic it would not let me down. Within just a couple of months, the drivers seat had a small hole in it. It was at a place where there could be nothing on your clothing, or body, to make a hole. I took my car in for its service to be done and informed the service manager about the issue. After a lot of talking back and forth with Toyota, they finally agreed to replace the cover for the seat, and told me that it was a ""one time deal"". Well, since then, I have had 3 more rears in the upolstery. I have no idea how it has happened, but I can tell you that there is no one that sits where the tears are. I am really disappointed with the quality of fabric Toyota has used for the seats. I am seriously thinking of getting out of my lease early.  Oh, by the way, this car was purchased brand new, with 40 miles on it."
"06  2, 2017",I love it,This car is very comfortable and has a lot more room than i expected. It runs beautifully and is very reliable.
"05 31, 2017",Great car!,"This is my 3rd RAV4. It's a great all-around vehicle. I've had two with the tire on the rear door, and now I have the newly style RAV4."
"05 30, 2017",Great upgrades!,"I bought the limited trim for the RAV4 and all of the upgrades make this vehicle go from good to great! Seat position memory buttons, heated seats, leather interior, extra subwoofer in the back, lane departure alert, upgraded stereo, and more. The vehicle rides very nice and is super reliable."
"05 29, 2017",Paint chipping on 2015 Rav4,"Great vehicle, nice ride, terrific reliability and value. However, small pencil size chips on the hood started showing up after the purchase. Now, two years into the vehicle, at least 15-20 of those chips has appeared. The chips are not because of road debris, but are due to inferior painting processes.  Online research shows many complaints of the same issue. Otherwise, fantastic vehicle."
"05 25, 2017",Love this car. Best choice I've made so far,"Love it. Smooth, spacious and comfortable. Love the sunroof and back up camera is a life saver. The interior is beautiful"
"05 21, 2017",Great car!,"Wonderful value and features! This car is beautiful , I love the moon roof! It's very reliable and efficient too"
"05 10, 2017",Leasing a Rav 4 2015,"This is the worst vehicle anyone  can lease or purchase. First when I went to sign the papers and give them a check of 4,000.00 plus 1,600.00 to insure the vehicle of scratches. When I asked to see the vehicle they refused to bring it for me to look at it unless I sign the papers, and they said it was in another lot. They refused to give me a test drive. So it wasn't until I signed the papers when they decided to bring me the vehicle. So when driving the vehicle home I notice that it sounded like a truck it felt like a truck. Did not like the sound of it.  Within that week I had to do alternate side so as I'm waiting in the have the running to keep warm since we're in the month of November I notice the gas gage is moving as if I'm driving the car. I right away took the car back to Toyota and complaint to them about this problem. They apparently check it out they claim there's no problem. It's been a year and 6 months and I'm still having this problem.  I hate this car with a passion."
"05  8, 2017",Good little SUV,i love the reliability of this car. drives really nice for long trips. its very versatile for everyday life. i have two dogs and they fit in the back nicely. if you get this vehicle get a different seat texture...i.e. leather or faux leather...if you have pets.
"05  6, 2017",Rav4 Toyota,"Ok car but I will not buy again
For the money it cost
Lack at comfort  in tow especially 
Should cost less"
"05  4, 2017",Dream Car,"Best vehicle I've ever owned! Beautiful interior, especially the leather touches on the interior Limited. Excellent room in the trunk and nice little touches that make it feel luxurious! Very reliable and will probably last forever!"
"04 30, 2017",The best vechile I ever purchased,"I purchased my RAV 4. This has been the best Toyota vehicle I have bought thus far. I previously purchased a 2010 Camry SLE/XLE.   The RAV 4 is more roomy, stylish, excellent driving in snow & ice. Good gas mileage also"
"04 24, 2017",Rav4 ever,"Great vehicle for the money, would recommend it to anyone, looking for a nice vehicle. A very reliable transport."
"04 24, 2017",My favorite I am on my 5th Toyota,Love the Ravs my 2nd one I have owned it's like running around on skates so very easy to get around in .
"04 22, 2017",Entune system is unreliable,"The performance of the sound system is very good. However, the Entune voice activated navigation function is laughable at times. It works properly about 50% of the time and often can't tell the verbal difference between Arizona and Maine."
"04 12, 2017",Great Vehicle,Me and my wife purchased a 2015 Toyota Rav-4 brand new and absolutely love the vehicle! The styling is sharp and the performance is impressive for a smallish SUV.
"03 30, 2017",Good Car so Far,"I traded in a 2010 Toyota for this 2015 RAV4. I have only had the RAV4 a few days and am very pleased with it thus far. If this Toyota is as reliable as the one I traded, I will be very pleased."
"03 30, 2017",Retired,"Nice looking, comfortable car with many good features.  Easy handling, ease in using the computer with navigational feature.  Plenty of room."
"03 14, 2017",I love this Rav4,This is my 4th Rav and my next one will be a rav I love this suv it handles so nicely it looks great and I love driving  it
"03  6, 2017",Fantastic Rav4,"I've never purchased a new vehicle before, but struck gold with this one. We test drove the new Subaru Forrester, Mazda CX-5, and this one when we were shopping. We intentionally didn't test drive the Honda CR-V since we didn't like the design. 

We were wowed with the comfort and control. We also like the exterior design and interior layout. It's a great vehicle and has been very dependable. We did have to get the wheels re-aligned after 1.5 years of driving, but I know I've hit a bump or two at a fast speed and was not surprised. We love the car and plan to have it for years to come. 

We got the basic package to keep the cost down, but we kind of wish we had the electrical back door and interior lights for the door electronic controls. Can't really see the button to unlock doors when it's dark out."
"03  1, 2017",Very Good but Not Great. Poor Transmission,"Overall this is a good car but Toyota cut corners from the previous 2008-11 generation.  My previous Rav4 was a 2009 AWD. The ride is improved and is quieter than last generation.  A big complaint is the 6-speed transmission. This RAV4 is programmed to always go to 6th gear, even at 45 mph.  That is about 1400 rpm and the engine has LOW torque. Also with 2 people in car at 70 mph on a 2% grade it cannot hold speed in cruise control and harshly downshifts from 6 to 4th gear revving engine to 4000. This occurs on every small grade.  Cruise control also Downshifts on a downhill grade to slow the car and does not upshift  for 5-7 seconds after you reach level ground. Just Wierd !!  The integrated phone and audio system is good. The AWD system is very good and average mileage is 24+ mpg.
This is the LE model but many interior items have been removed from the 2009 BASE model Rav4 to cut costs. Here is a short list:
Only one 12v outlet inside, none in center console and none in rear area
Delay wipers have no adjustment - 1 delay time only
No eyeglass storage in headliner above front seats.
Rear Seats no longer slide fore-aft and on and on.

Toyota also refuses to give an accessible plug for rear lights for trailers.
All Tacoma's and Tundra's have this plug under the bumper.
All interior rear panels on RAV must be removed to install the adapter: cost is $300+
Overall I would not purchase another RAV4."
"01 28, 2017",Great experience from start to finish,Zach was my salesman. He was very knowledgable of all cars on the lot. He helped me make the best decision within my budget and made it clear of what I was getting along the way as far as warranties. I live over 300 miles away and he helped me finish all of the paperwork over the phone. He registered my car with secretary of state and even had my plate on it when he had the car driven 150 miles north to meet me with my car! He went above and beyond throughout the process and I would highly recommend doing business with him.
"01  5, 2017","Not a Lexus, but what a car!","I highly recommend buying a Toyota RAV4 at a Lexus dealership. Great car. Great salesman (Ignacio), and great service."
"12 14, 2016",Great for family,"Economical and Worth the buy.  It saves on gas, handles the road smoothly and has a lot of space.  Beautiful exterior and interior. Makes sure to get the feature back up camera. It helps a lot."
"11 16, 2016",My Dream Car,"My 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD is my dream  car come true, superior Audio System, Reliability unmatched, outstanding exterior style design, AWD, Manual Option gears, optional Daylights, heated Side Driving mirrors, Moon Roof, a strong Roof Carrier with Cross Bars, good Gas Economy,  Roomy interior and Good Visibility- all in one package. However, I doubt the durability of the seats clothing and the dashboard padded cover below the audio screen and wish the GPS Navigation is inclued in the XLE package. Butf for now, I just love my practical RAV 4 like no other."
"09 27, 2016",Rough Ride,"I am very disssapointed with the hard ride of the car.
When it hits a bump or just a sewer cover,  even driving slow, it jars the entire car.  You feel like your are rocking and rolling and vibrates through your body.
Riding on the Belt Parkway recently, by the time i got home to Long Island, I was sick to my stomach from the ride.  Also does not handle well even on parkway, as it seems to wobble.
It also is noisy on the inside of the car when driving.
The voice recognition is not the best.
Very disappointed as I like the style, and setup of the car, but not the ride.  When I brought it in to have service manager drive it, he was in agreement with the hard ride.  Turns out one of the shock absorbers was leaking, but that did not make any difference when it was replaced.
Sorry to say, but this one has to go.\"
"09  3, 2016",Ada's review,"It's a very reliable car with a very smooth ride. The interior could be much better and not happy with the poor crash rating. Gas mileage could be much better, and the navigation system has limits, it won't accept all addresses."
"08 28, 2016",Most reliable crossover on the market,"This car is SUPER reliable. I have had zero issues with this vehicle and expect to drive it for many years to come. I live in the mountains and have taken this car on every terrain imaginable, and it performs every time. The quality on the interior certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but after trading in my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (w 28k miles), I know better than anyone that all the fancy features and comfort in the world do not make up for a mechanically unreliable vehicle. The Jeep was one problem after another, despite having only 28k miles.

In comparison, the Rav4 has needed nothing since the day I drove it off the lot. If some cheap details in the cabin are the worst thing about this SUV, then you know it's a good vehicle. Toyota did not cut corners where it counts with this vehicle (i.e. under the hood). Do NOT buy this car expecting a luxury ride or excellent features--buy this car because you want a vehicle that will get you where you need to go no matter what, and will last you 10+ years with minimal problems. Who cares if people think it's ""boring"" to drive? After my Jeep nightmare, I can tell you that it is WAY more boring to sit at a dealership for hours waiting for repairs!!

 When you start up the Rav you know you will get to your destination no matter what. At the end of the day, that's all I care about. If you're a buyer with similar priorities, you'll love the Rav4"
"08  8, 2016",never buy-- noisy Bluttooth and noisy drive,"unfortunately its not a good car to buy. very noisy drive on freeway and when you use car's Bluetooth on freeway, the other person thinks you car window is down. As per Toyota service manager its a built in technical fault and can not be fixed. 

I will suggest check this issue before buying."
"06 30, 2016",love it,"I purchased my Rav4 used.  I fell in love with it right away.  It handles well, turns great.  The A/C works great.  I wish the mirror adjustments, and the switches for the windows would light up at night.  I also think it is odd that I don't have automatic headlights.  My last car was a 2005 and it had automatic headlights.  That was disappointing. I love it anyway and would buy it again."
"06 18, 2016","good, not great, car","Body has  tight, solid feel to it.  Very easy and comfortable to drive and turning circle is small.  suspension fairly  stiff(l like that) rather than mushy. Very responsive to steering and brakes, really helped me avoid an accident.  Fantastic blind spot sensors and rear cross traffic sensors on Limited and great high beam auto dimmer as well.  Audio unit links pretty well and reliably with Moto-x phone.  Audio system sounds pretty decent on the Limited and has separate bass, mid , treble for each audio input type.  good lumbar support.  good interior room for class. absolutely great/powerful A/C.

cons:  lots of road noise at higher speed.  some areas of interior feel cheap and plasticky.  lots of rattling around the center console in cooler weather-very annoying.  only 3 band eq.  no usb folder browsing-very annoying.  accel just okay, would have been nice to have v6 option like they used to.  other aspects, like no illumination in the door lock controls, no homelink, no lights or reflectors  in the opened doors, etc., give the car a  low-end feel, even in the Limited.  Mileage I guess is about average for class, but gas tank seems really small, so I am refilling very often."
"05 22, 2016",A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"This car performs great but Toyota allows little things to make me think twice about it.
The window and mirror controls does not illuminate in the dark. USB just won't read folders unlike previous models including 2012 camry.
The cruise control is awkwardly placed , have to be looking down all the time.
USB READING FOLDERS IS MY BIGGEST HANGUP.
FIX IT TOYOTA !!!!!!!"
"04 29, 2016",Toyota no more,"Got Toyota due to its reliability ad. My big mistake. Expensive fixes at dealership match my 15 year old BMW expenses, but the frequency of it goes far beyond.
One thing for sure - Toyota advertisement worked."
"03 26, 2016",XLE 2015,"I have Toyota XLE 2015 and other than interior design, I'm really happy with it. It's very good in Gas and very reliable."
"02 14, 2016",Not the best car!,"I owned 4 Toyota cars before - 1 Corolla, 2 Camry, 1 RAV4. This is my 5th Toyota. Over the years Toyota quality has gone down. With this RAV4 2015, the interior is very dark specially in nights. The door lock / unlock, window roll-down lock, and mirror adjustment buttons are not lit. There is NO low-beam indicator on the dashboard. These are standard features in any other car. I asked the dealership to bring this to Toyota's attention. They refused to do it. Very disappointed with Toyota. This is my last one."
"02 12, 2016",Most reliable car I have owend.,I love my 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD I live in Nebraska and it does amazing in the winters here. It is very roomy and has plenty of rom for my grandchildren. I had a 2012 Ford Escape that I traded in because it had quite a few problems it started to jump some times when you hit the gas. I chose the Rav 4 because Toyota is very reliable. I LOVE MY RAV 4
"01 26, 2016",Nicest car I have ever owned,"First time I have ever got a vehicle with all the bells and whistles. Lane assist is amazing, had a neck fusion a few years ago. This helps me so much. I press a button on the steering wheel, a voice asks me what I want? I can change the channel on the radio, get directions, simply amazing."
"01  2, 2016",A quality car at a great price.,"I just purchased a new 2015 Toyota RAV4 and couldn't be more pleased. The car is very roomy for it's class. The car has a very tight + solid feel to it. The car looks great on the outside and the inside. The dash has a nice layout with all the controls within easy reach. I especially like the fact that the all wheel drive system, which is activated when the system detects wheel slippage, can be turned on manually when you are traveling in very slippery conditions provided you don't exceed 25 mph in the manually locked in mode.

I found the Toyota personnel including sales, management, vehicle service and clerical to be very pleasant and helpful. It was a very good buying experience. I highly recommend the RAV4."
"12 20, 2015",dim dashboard lights in the daylight,"I find that the dashboard light are dim in the daylight. When driving wearing sunglasses, I have problems seeing the odometer. I have to ride without wearing sunglasses in order to see how fast I'm going."
"12 16, 2015",Great on gas,So far I am concerned I am very pleased with the Rav 4 Limited. By buying the Limited we received things that we would have to pay for on other Rav 4's. Plenty of leg room both in the front and rear seats. Everything at your fingertips. You never need to take your hands off the wheel. The only thing that I think can be improved on is the size if the window where the radio and traffic is. It is hard to set up the nav trip because it is so small. But I love my Rave 4.
"12 10, 2015",Small Tank Capacity,"First off I'm satisfied with most things on my new 2015 Rav4. However I am very disappointed with the gas tanks fuel capacity. For the last 3 fill ups which I let go down to almost empty, I was only able to get between 46-48 Liters into the tank. I've addressed this issue with the dealer and Toyota Canada and both still think it is my faulty statistics that are wrong. I have documented through receipts and pictures as proof that that's all I'm able to get into the tank. They say continue to monitor. This is totally unacceptable given the specs say I should be able to get close to 60 L in the tank. As a result I'm filling up every week of my city commute. Anyone else having this issue???"
"12  1, 2015",toyota Rav 4,"I was overall impressed with this dealership at Hudiburg Toyota in MWC OK. My sales associate Greg Fanning was smart, honest, and detail oriented with everything that I wanted in my car. If he didn't know the answer than he would find the answer. He worked hard to give me the best price possible. I was very satisfied with the car that I purchased along with the customer service I received at the dealership. I would recommend this place along with Greg Fanning as the representative any day of the week!"
"11 15, 2015",My new RAV4,"My purchasing experience was excellent at Hudiburg Toyota. I just purchase a new car for me. My old 20 years old car broke, and I found a great deal and lots of help with Ralph Jones III.
At the dealership they guide me and advise on the choices that I had and they also informed me about the great benefits in all the options.
I appreciated all the help and the amazing that car that i have now, it is not also time to renovate but also to get something that fits my needs.

I am thankful to Hudiburg Toyota."
"11 14, 2015",Seems OK so far,OK but I would like less use of hard plastics and very low grade carpet. Some interior materials seem cheep. Macanicaly seems OK.
"11  8, 2015",love this car so far,"I just have this car for 2 months and I love it. Driving experience is smooth and comfortable. Rearview camera is very very helpful for parallel parking and backward parking. Well designed steering wheel make it so easy to control the audio system while you are driving-you can adjust everything with you thumb, even answer a call.
I always choose economic gas usage model so I spent almost the same gas money as I did on a Mazda protege before.
The only flaw so far is a little bumpy when you drive on a not-so-smooth surface. That's probably the problem for all SUVs."
"11  6, 2015",uncomfortable,"Front seats are ""NOT"" for bigger people. Drivers seat is too narrow for comfort. I am 6'2 and 230 lbs and made a big mistake buying a 2015 limited. Your right leg will ride on top of side buttress and if you go over 5 miles, you will be feeling it. Can't do anything about it now, just warn others. By the way, I love Toyota's- had a Camry before-wish I still had it. That's life. Oh, yes. if you are going from a regular car to an SUV, remember they are totally different beasts. Ride will be harsher, inside will be louder-think about it wisely."
"11  2, 2015",Perfect balance between luxury and utility,I have had 4 other Rav4's and this is the first Limited. Very nice vehicle with my only complaint being the somewhat narrow bucket seats. Nicely appointed and all the bells and whistles I could have wanted.
"11  2, 2015",NOT ALL IMPROVEMENTS ARE,"WITH 345000 MILES ON MY '99 RAV IT WAS TIME FOR NEW WHEELS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREAT 360 DEGREE WINDOW VISABILITY? THE BACK UP CAM DOES NOT COMPENSATE. INTERIOR - POORLY THOUGHT OUT. THE CUP WELLS SWALLOW THE CUPS. METAL TRIM STRIP IS SUN GLARING. WHY HIDE THE KEY IGNITION. USEFUL STORAGE IS HARD TO FIND / USE. WHY CANNT YOU DIM THE VIDEO SCREEN AT NIGHT (LIKE THE DASH LITES)? THANK GOODNESS THE '99 IS STILL IN THE DRIVEWAY. IT MAY TAKE ME TO 500,000 MILES YET"
"11  1, 2015",First Toyota,"I have had my RAV4 LE for 6 months and love everything about it except the black interior, everything seems to stick to it and it is hard to keep it looking clean. It is fun to drive, I have taken trips in it and it has done great and it is great for running around town in. This is my first Toyota, but it won't be my last."
"10 19, 2015",5K mile review,"So this is my 5th toyota I have owned through almost 19 years of driving. I have the 2015 Rav4 LE AWD model. I now have put on 5k miles through 6 months of ownership. The things I like about the vehicle: toyota reliability and dependability of course, nice acceleration, comfortable big seats, very generous leg room (front and rear), good trunk space, exterior styling, descent gas mileage (I get about 18.5 in the city and about 26 on the hwy.), and I love that it has a 6 speed automatic trans. Instead of the the CVT trans. Like the nissan rogue and honda cr-v. What I don't like about this vehicle: the seat fabric makes it challenging to keep extra clean, I would add a sunglass holder, I would make the front window sun visors to slide out for extra sun protection while driving, I would add a compass on the mirror for the LE model, instead of hub caps I would like alloy wheels, I would like splash guards to come with the vehicle, the Bluetooth does not always work, the doors seem really flimsy, especially the outside door handles, i would like the top of the front windshield to have a bit of tint to block some of the sun while driving, and I would like the front cup holders to be next to each other not a foot apart. This SUV may be a bit vanilla to most, but I take it for what it is: a company that built their good reputation throughout the years by making good quality cars that last a long time. So far no problems for me with this vehicle. I will add a review in years to come as the mileage piles up. Thanks!"
"10  3, 2015",Toyota RAV4: Great for short rides!,"Love my new Rav 4 Limited Edition. The 2 color leather seats are so stylish (Teracotta). So far (2 weeks) so good. However, IF YOU TAKE LONG DRIVES DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CAR. I took it on a LONG drive (5 hours each way) and felt like I was getting off of a horse when I arrived! My toosh was sore! The ""bucket seats"" really hug you -- too much. There's a lumbar support which I turned off to give me some relief. Thankfully I have the Limited edition with power seats which allow the driver to adjust the seats during the ride. Maybe it would be more comfy it you are really petite?
One other negative is that I found the leather seats hot on a long ride on a hot day. My lower back was sweaty! And I had the AC running on high! I'm guessing it's the leather snug seats? (never happened in my Camry LXE w/ leather seats). I love being up high\ which is a plus...This is a Small SUV inside, overall. I happen to like that, but if you're looking for a large SUV this isn't it. I drive this into NYC daily so didn't want a big car but did want to be HIGH up. I feel safe in this car! And the view is great! The front windshield is really wide! I have to get used to not having a trunk like I had in my Camry. I miss it. This has a nice hatch back area with a security shade. The seats in back go down very easily if you needed the room. I'm happy with it overall! We'll drive my husbands big car on long rides!"
"09 30, 2015",unimpressed,disappointed with performance and ride which is 90% of the reason for buying. test drive should have been longer. the more I drive the less I like it. Go for the limited version as the sound system in the xle sucks and no auto. button for the rear door sucks. There is really very little room to store things and even with seats down it fills up fast. Styling is nice and I'm hoping it handles well in the winter weather or I'll probably trade in and take a loss.
"09 26, 2015",Busy Mom,"I am very excited to own my new Toyota Rav4! It is a sporty yet classy vehicle. Previously I owned a Sequoia so I had some concerns with both the much smaller size and engine on the Rav4, however I am not disappointed at all. The Rav4 is more spacious on the inside then it looks on the outside. When I read reviews prior to my purchase others had mentioned problems with pick up and maintaining speed while going up hills. I have not found any of these problems to be true for me. In fact, on the contrary I am delighted with its performance. I frequently have to ramp onto dangerous and busy highways and have not had any concerns at all. I would strongly recommend this vehicle to others without hesitation."
"09 22, 2015",2015 RAV4 XLE,"2015 RAV 4 XLE is a vast improvement over the previous model. Prior to our 2015 we had a 2008 which was a good car but the styling, rear swing open tailgate and 4 speed transmission let it down. Our transmission would hut and violently downshift and upshift when going uphill at 65 MPH. We took it to the dealer for repair 3 times and they had no resolution. The mileage was also poor at 22 combined.
2015 PROS: 6 speed transmission like our 2013 Camry, Swing up lift gate, 28 mpg combined in eco mode, Back up camera. Touch screen, Driving range
CONS: Road noise higher than 2008 and MUCH Higher than in our Camry, Same fuel tank as Camry that shuts off at about 13GL. You can put 2 additional GL in both cars and increase range by 60 miles, Limited cubby/storage areas.
Overall the best choice and value in the category!!"
"09 21, 2015","Cute, but not so comfy","My first biggest complaint is the rock hard seats & uncomfortable road trip on my butt and back.
The engine idles loud.
The brake tends to be hard to keep down and constant pressure that it makes my foot cramp in rush hour traffic.
Lack of suspension, feels like the back end is going to drop out when hitting a small bump in the road or anything that is not a smooth surface.
The seats sit quite low, that I can't put my elbow on the door ledge to relax while driving.
The metal piece on top of dash is blinding when sun hits it, and you cannot read the clock if the sun is coming through the front windshield.
I have yet to get the GPS voice to work with my phone. If my bluetooth is on, I can't even hear the directions coming from my phone.
And I regret not getting power seats and power trunk.
I had a minivan that was 10 years old, that I can describe in two words...luxury ride!
I'm actually looking forward to selling it in about 15-18 months from now. I've already contacted my sales person and he's willing to help me out when that time comes....
I do many day trips, road trips and this car is not cut out for anything longer than a 30 minute drive to and from. I'm disappointed Toyota."
"09 10, 2015",BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN 30 YEARS,"HAD GREAT 2009 RAV4. TRADED IN FOR 2015 RAV
4. CANNOT DRIVE WITH LOW BEAMS AND SEE. LIKE DRIVING INTO BLACK WALL. HAD FOG I
LITES INSTALLED($400) SO COULD SEE ON LOW BEAMS. LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM. TEST DRIV AT NITE OUT OF TOWN AND YOU WONT BUY THIS MODEL. WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BULB CREATING THIS PROBLEM. BACKUP SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN IN SUNLITE, NO LOCKING GLOVE BOX, NO SUNGLASS STORAGE OVER DASH, NO DUAL CONSOLE STORAGE,NO DUAL GLOVE BOX, SMALLER SIDE VIEW MIRRORS. CANNOT COMMENT ON MILAGE AS ONLY HAVE 400 MILES ON IT. CONTACTED TOYOTA ANG GOT BLOWN OFF. VERY POOR CONSUMER RELATIONS. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR TO ANYONE. BE BETTER OFF WITH A CHEAPER MODEL OR MAKE."
"09  4, 2015",Fantastic SUV.,"Very comfortable with lots of room.

Unbelievable gas mileage, can not wait to drive it in the snow plus we got a super deal. We are very happy
With this vehicle."
"08 31, 2015",Best Car transaction ever,"I love my new car and the expedited ""buying time"" my dealer gave me. Everyone was respectful, listened to us, and answered all our questions. Excellent transaction."
"08 29, 2015",It's a good and reliable vehicle,"This is my second Rav4. Purchased the XLE trim this time. Traded in a 2010 Limited with a V6. Overall I'm happy with the vehicle. The sale price and 0% financing made it a logical choice without breaking the bank. Only reason I traded the 2010 was because it was FWD and I needed AWD.

Pros:
Interior space with back seats down
Eco, Normal and Sport mode choices and good fuel economy
Excellent crash tests and safety results
Relatively quiet ride, good visibility
AWD in the snow
Toyota quality and high residual value

Cons:
Weak lumbar support which can get uncomfortable on long drives
Fabric armrests on doors can show dirt easily
Small capacity fuel tank"
"08 19, 2015",Speedometer inaccuracy,"My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership. An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy. The warranty is 36,000 miles. That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty. Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300. Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer. I went through arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement on July 8, 2015. I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications. In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening. In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.
Otherwise the vehicle operates fine. However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers. I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device. It is definitely underpowered. Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy. Bluetooth doesn't always work. Great for hauling stuff. Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there."
"08 11, 2015",Best driving car I have owned,"I Love my new RAV4, and so do my Grandchildren who are 12 and 11. They like the room and the ease of getting their things out of thee back when we are just going a short distance. They think all the gadgets as they call them are COOL."
"08  7, 2015",best overall exceptional price,"Styling and price beyond comparison in its category and class. Human functionality fluid and above average. I am a large man and find the vehicle to be tight to get in and out of. There also seems to be a great deal of engine and road noise. These 2 factors are minor when considering all amenitys, standard options, and overall drivability of the vehicle. Recommend the Forerunner for anyone over 6'2 or 270 lbs. It was a very good fit. I still greatly enjoy the rav4 though."
"07 30, 2015",Not my best buy,"I traded in an older RAV for a 2015 LE model and I regret having done so. Incredibly the older RAV handled far better and the engine noise was quieter. The LE model doesn't come with fog lights and the black fillers make the vehicle look very tacky. The 2015 RAV acceleration is fair at best and the handling is far from special. Overall the 2015 Rav seems functional but functional is the kindest thing I can call it. It looks and drives like vehicle that should sell for several thousand dollars less. This is my third Toyota Rav and it's also my last one. I would gladly swap it for a competitor's model if I could. Pretty much any competitor. If you're determined to purchase a 2015 Rav, I strongly urge you to at least avoid the entry level LE model. It's somewhat cheaper and the slightly lower price is self evident in the vehicle itself."
"07 20, 2015",BlueTooth System is TERRIBLE!!!,"Bought a new car and the sales experience was incredibly bad- we were basically held hostage and not allowed to leave to eat. After 5 hours and 2 mistakes with the paperwork, we left. The Bluetooth system is very poor and no one can hear me when I call using it on the car. I have had it back to Toyota 3 times and they indicate it is my problem - not the car. this is my 4th new Toyota and will likely be my last as they don't want to fix the problem and most people believe it is the microphone. Buying a new car should be fun and exciting but not this time. I recommend you look to other companies due to the problems with the software and if hands-free is required in your state, this system is horrible."
"07 18, 2015",bought Toyotas for past sixteen years,I trust the Toyota product very happy with my choice. The city here gets a lot of rain and i like the little higher vehicle. Also I am tall and more comfortable getting in and out of this size vehicle. I love the interior all the accessories are easily accessible and right where I am accustomed to. It has a back up camera which I have learned to love for safety. I enjoy the seats folding flat for carrying larger items. The back door makes loading groceries easier and not as much stretch and bending. Appreciate the help with knowing prices thanks.
"07  2, 2015",Best of the three Toyota's I've owned.,"The RAV4 has a great sound system and handles like a dream. I've been to Geargia two times in the safest and most comfortable SUV It handles great, sight line is excellent, smooth transition of the gears good on gas."
"06 22, 2015",A Review of My 2014 Toyota Rav 4,"This comment applies to all Toyotas I have seen, but especially my 2014 Rav 4, which has black fabric seats.

The materials Toyota uses for fabric seats have never been particularly well chosen (from a design, look and feel standpoint).

My 2014 Rav 4 is a really terrific car in all ways but one - it has black fabric seats, and the fabric looks, and feels cheap, and is impossible to keep clean especially from pet hair (even when pets have never set foot in the car). The fabric is far more problematic than the fabrics in my 2012 and 2010 Ravs, although these were not stellar either by any means (just not like Velcro).

Toyota would do well to take a look at the fabrics used to upholster Honda CRV interiors, which look and feel far superior, and which do not function like Velcro for pet hair and similar stuff. It is the one major design flaw in the vehicle (looks like the 2015s are much the same!), and, it's so annoying, my next car my well have to be the Honda CRV instead."
"06 16, 2015",2015 Toyota Rav4 XLE.,"Though overall I like the vehicle, I was disappointed with 3 things that I thought were standard in XLE models (this is not basic model):

1) Does not have auto seat adjust.
2) Does not have lumbar support.
3) Does not have auto headlights.

Drive is very comfortable and could have few additional bells & whistle as blind spot indicator."
"06 11, 2015",First week down and I'm thrilled,"I was looking to replace my minivan with something smaller and more efficient but with large seating areas. I cannot believe how big the rear seat area is, even with the front seats all of the way back. The RAV4 sits higher than the typical economy sedan like a Corolla or Civic, so getting the kids in and out is much easier. This would likely also apply to seniors.
The car also drives very nicely. I cannot believe other reviews mention that it is underpowered. My FWD LE seems to scoot quite well. I also really like how the 6 speed auto transmission always seems to be in the right gear at the right time.
The thing about other makes is that when you get a base model the interior really looks like it. The base level LE RAV4 looks like a quality car from inside and out. The interior is beautiful, but oddly has mabye 5 or 6 different materials and textures. I am averaging 24+ MPG tooling around town so far, but have yet to take a long highway drive to test highway mileage.
I really am impressed with the integrated stereo/bluetooth phone controls/backup camera setup. Again, a base car with top line features. Stereo sound is very good IMO, especially in CD mode.
If you want a car that is small outside but very large and comfortable inside the RAV4 should be considered. For the price paid it can't be beat."
"05  6, 2015",Interior features not as good as our former 2007 R,"Short comings of Interior Design (vs 2007 RAV4)
Some panel light not lit without the lights being on
(requires turning on lights well before needed)
No place to store glasses or sunglasses
(In the 2007 RAV4 there was room for 3 pairs)
Not as many places to store misc small things (1 vs 2)
Console between seats lacks space for storage of
small, flat items, as was present on the 2007 RAV4.
The extra glove compartment of the 2007 RAV4 is now
only a shelf on the dashboard.

Even the 2007 RAV4 lacked storage space for flat materials such as maps, so they will continue to be stuffed between the seat and the center console."
"04 21, 2015",Great car,"I recently bought a 2015 Rav 4 XLE AWD , and I love it. The color I picked is Barcelona Red and everyone that sees it thinks its a beautiful color. Does it ride like a luxury SUV? No but still, it rides smoother than a lot of small suv on the road. In short, I would recommend the rav 4 if you are looking for a small SUV with class and at a great price."
"04 13, 2015",Again,I have enjoyed my 14 year old Rav4 so much that I bought another one. Can't beat a good thing. So far so good.
"04 11, 2015","Toyota to the T, not for me","I ended up in a fender bender the other week and needed my vehicle repaired. I drive a 2010 Hyundia Electra. The only reason why I purchased this vehicle is the MPG's as I was driving 84 miles one way to work. When the economy was really bad back in 2011 I was desperate.

Anyway, this is an good vehicle, but sort of disappointed. For all of the hoopla of that Toyota's are exemplary vehicles to drive I just don't get it. They do drive pretty good, nice seating position, seats are decent but nothing to write home about. I had the AWD and experienced OK gas mileage. When I was on the highway I experienced roughly 27-29 MPG which isn't half-bad for AWD. As soon as I get to stop and go traffic I saw my fuel gauge drop. It has enough pep to merge with traffic but not enough to do any inspiring driving.

I guess that's just it. It does well enough on everything but nothing to say ""Wow I can't wait to drive this thing"". It was more or less ""I can't wait to get home"". I mean it's not a bad CUV but I can name a plethora of CUVs that I would look into getting prior to getting this. Maybe the Lexus version is more inspiring I would imagine.

Some months ago I test drove a 2014 Jeep Cherokee 4 cylinder in Louisiana. It was your standard front wheel drive mid range (latitude I believe) and I feel that it was more inspiring to drive this CUV.

The best way to describe it is to compare it to MR or MRS reliable. Their not bad and they get the job done just don't expect anything more."
"04  4, 2015",disappointed,"The seats are uncomfortable, rough ride, rigid frame and every pot hole, or bump in the road sends a jolt to the passenger's. Gas mileage sucks."
"04  1, 2015",Beware of salesman claiming blue tooth capability,"Just bought a new RAv 4- switched from an Altima. Was promised a hands free blue tooth system. Which is true as long as the only thing you want to do is make phone calls similar to the function of an old flip phone. Texting function has no voice recognition so you have to read and select pre-selected messages. When the salesman explained that unless i wanted to upgrade ($8,000.00 ) for the top line model, I would not have GPS on the car. I though fine. My abdroid phone will do that and if I have blue tooth. Im good. But the car will not let the phone do that at least not thru the speakers. I either have to spend time reprograming the system everytime I want to use a map app (not something that is hands free and I have to stop the car) or unpair the phone and not be able to get phone calls thru bluetooth. They suggested I should buy a new phone. Verizon guys assumed the car was before 2008--the programing was so simple (AND CHEAP FOR TOYOTA) also that a new phone would not fix the programing in the car. And every time you turn the car off it goes back to the default setting that plays all my ringtones like a playlist and then has map lady in background talking softly. The volume control needs to be VERY LOUD for the map app and will blast you on all other audio.

Also mileage is not as listed best is 27 not 31 mpg (with coasting down all hills and reduced speed. and worst is 18 not 22."
"03 29, 2015",NIce Car,Would recommend this vehicle for anyone driving a lot of miles but needs some space.Great for getting around in traffic or crowed parking lots.
"03 23, 2015",NEW 2015 RAV4 XLE,"Just replaced a 2014 RAV4 XLE that was totaled in an accident with a 2015 RAV4 XLE. Only difference was color change from Shoreline Blue Pearl to Super White. Great little CUV, no issues with year old unit in the 10k miles of ownership. This is my 10th Toyota and all have performed excellently. Strongest resale value of any small SUVs."
"03 15, 2015",Most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"Purchased 2015 Toyota RAV4
Pros - All wheel drive is excellent for our snowy Wisconsin winters
Cons ?Installing a very stiff suspension system to make it seem like it has sportier handling has produced an extremely harsh, rough ride with even the littles bumps creating a sharp jolt to the passengers.
--Toyota also decided to sacrifice driver comfort for anyone over 6? by:
1- Not allowing the seat to move back far enough and the driver to decide how much room to leave for the back seat passenger even though there is a lot of extra room behind it when no one is in the back seat. This keeps a taller persons knees against the dash and the cruise control to hit your leg.
2 -Only way to sit is with seat in reclining position making it impossible to maintain correct posture and avoid back problems.
3-Jamming the seat belt receiver clip below the seat bottom as well as being sandwiched tightly between the seat and center counsel rather than having it project above the seat so it can be used.
4-Unusable sun visor is recessed into the ceiling without any wide spot in the ceiling to grab and lower it.
5-Slush and salt builds up on inside bottom of the doors in winter driving regions. This increases rusting possibilities and falls off in the garage or on a person?s lower legs as you exit the vehicle.
6 -Difficult entry for tall person due to sharp sloping roof line.
7-Ridges on top of front fenders make it impossible to judge where outside edges of front fenders are. Terrible to park and drive in town."
"02 20, 2015",Well designed reliable nimble and sharp to look at,"We bought the Toyota based on the extreme reliability we enjoyed with our previous 2009 Toyota Camry. The Camry was driven 165000 miles including severe winter weather with salt and snow covered roads common to Vermont. When we traded the Camry it still looked and drove great. It was on its second set of brake pads. The original set was replaced at 110000 miles. The rotors were fine. The only repair item needed was a water pump at 125000 miles. We always used synthetic oil. The engine stayed clean and ran like new.

If the Rav 4 is as reliable as the Camry we will be happy.
We went with the Rav 4 because of the extra cargo capacity and all wheel drive. It's s very comfortable car to drive on the highway. Gas milage is around 25-27 mpg so far. Six speed transmission is smooth and is always in the right gear for each driving condition. We especially like the push button keyless ignition that came with the limited edition."
"02  2, 2015",smaller,I aqm pleased with the new Rav4. I have some problems with the location of controls such as cruise control. Lots of whistle and gadgets to distract a driver. Communication with the sales person after the sale has been a problem. Part of the deal was a trailer hitch. We purchased the vehicle on 6 Jan 2015. the hitch still needs a wiring harness. Way to long to complete the installation.
"01 28, 2015",Stylish and fun,"I love the style, the interior, backup camera, navigation system, sound system, handlingPlus there is a lot of room inside and in the back,. The only thing missing I wished that it had is where you can program it for your garage door opener. If it has that I haven't found it yet."
"01 25, 2015",great car,Love every thing abou this car except hard to understand how to set up the radio etc . Speaker blue tooth is dificult for people to understand me.
"01 10, 2015",not a bad ride...,"I do not agree with the writer that was comparing his V6 limited Rav4 with this one... its like comparing the old style Rav4 with the 4 cylinder with the V6 model... two totally different vehicles.. MOST people that are buying a smaller SUV are buying it to get them higher off the ground than a sedan, easier access to and better storage and the availability of 4 wheel drive... I had a V6 Rav4 as well, and it was way too powerful for that size of a vehicle... I now have a 2013 Rav4 and its great at doing what it was made for... I lug two 16 year old boys to away hockey tournaments all the time in it, with two adults in the front... and the dashboard is perfectly placed, simple to use and works well... I'm 6'3"", 240 lbs and I have no problem getting in or out of this vehicle and quite comfortable in it for long drives... I will say that the 2009 Rav4 I had, was of a bit better quality (plastics, etc) but for what I paid, I like this mid size SUV..."
"01  8, 2015",Poorest suv i've ever had,Wish i had not bought this RAV4...i have bought the Honda CR-V and is perfection...this is a poor design SUV and with the poorest client service
"12  7, 2014",Not recommended,It is just a nice try. 4 cylinder engine is not performing at all. Currently I have a 2012 V6 limited and I am extremely happy with the car. I test drive one 2015 4 Cylinder fully loaded one. It was a big frustration new RAV4 is NOT performing on the road at all. If you like to have a car can deal with the winter conditions like me I suggest to think twice to buy new RAV4
"11 14, 2014","nice car ,toyota brakes","first Toyota I've owned-roomy inside, great view of road. braking is only thing I don't like- car feels like it accelerates when you are braking. Specialist checked and stated this is normal for a Toyota, says it is safe-just feels a bit unnerving to have car ""accelerate"" when you are braking. wish breaking was smoother."
"11 10, 2014",Smart and Stylish Reliable Car,"The car as beautifuly stylish as smart. Considering that's a pretty big car I highly recommend to buy TechPackage if you want to save time, nerves and skip guessing (especially going back).
Depending on your road conditions you can choose Sport, Eco (economical) or normal Drive Mode. Most time I use Eco Mode because like I said that's a pretty big car!.
One more benefit - Moon Roof: you may add some fresh air with less noise and polution from a road. And there is plenty of room for 5 people. I LOVE MY NEW CAR !"
"11  1, 2014",Best deal in town,"Received the best deal in town at Hendrick Toyota of Merriam kansas. Worked with me to make sure I was completely satisfied with my deal. Pleasant & friendly. Would recomend you purchase your next car. I worked with Jennifer Vinson, Jeff Breaux and Robert Biehl."
"10 26, 2014",Wonderful car,"My new 2015 RAV4 Limited replaces my 2004 RAV4 Limited. The new car is much bigger than the old one. It is nearly as big as my 2005 Highlander. The car rides firmly but comfortably. The engine power could be stronger but it is adequate. The navigation system has made several minor errors but no system is 100% accurate. I've been averaging about 24 mpg for combined local and highway driving. The back-up camera with cross traffic alert, the blind spot monitors and the lane departure alert are very welcome and useful features. The JBL sound system is excellent. There is plenty of storage space in the cabin, but I miss the small draw in the dash of my old RAV4 that I used to hold coins for parking meters. The placement of the vanity mirror light in the ceiling rather than on the visor provides better lighting. I also like the power lift gate. It is much more convenient than the old horizontally opening door with the spare mounted on it. The spare is now out of the way under the floor of back cargo area."
"03  5, 2024",Just saying..,Oil changes cost too much. Other than that and replacing tires and battery which are both costly the car is great. Toyota is by and large a great company. I just wish we could keep costs down
"03  2, 2024",363.000 miles and going!!!,"I bought my car new Nov 23rd of 2016.  I now have 363,000 miles on it and I LOVE it.  I drive a ton, all my expenses are my own and this car is the best car I have had.  Very low maintenance!  My first set of tires made it to over 100,000 miles same with front brakes.  My rear brakes made it over 200,000 miles before I had to change them!  I fixed the water pump, right side hubs and regular maintenance and that is it!  I do regular oil changes and tire rotations at 10,000 miles.  I am mostly highway miles.  I have been debating more room and getting a Sienna, but I know my Rav is reliable and I am nervous to try something else."
"05 17, 2023",Super Reliable,"I have owned 3 Toyotas and none have disappointed. The RAV4 is a reliable vehicle that will last longer than most cars as long as you keep it serviced. All I have ever had to do to my RAV4 was change the parts that normally wear out over time like brakes, tires, and battery."
"11 28, 2022",2016 Toy Rav4 EXL,"No problems.
 It goes.
Comfortable right size for me. 
Only problem is the battery wore out. The  airbags. The light in the panel says malfunction."
"10 25, 2022",My Dependable Rav 4,"I have owned 3 Toyota Rav 4s. This car has been extremely dependable. It has 60,000 miles. The only repair has been to the brakes. It gets good gas mileage. Front and rear vision are good. It is all wheel drive an d handles good inn snow"
"10 11, 2022","My experience with my Toyota Rav 4, model 2016","My experience with my Toyota Rav 4, 2016 horrible. First all the panel lights came on. ABS was one of my biggest fears. Sometimes I would have breaks and sometimes I wouldn't. It would cut off going down the road leaving me with no stealing ability. I drove 7 miles down the road and the battery exploded wich then burned my car up. Glad I had full coverage. Later learned these things were a recall but Toyota never contacted me!!"
"09  5, 2022","Toyota of Johnson city , aims to please","my Rav4 seems to be an awesome vehicle,  just not fond of all black interior. Toyota of Johnson city, is awesome.  highly recommend them if you're interested in another vehicle.  sales staff is awesome"
"08 28, 2022",2016 Toy Rav4 EXL,"Excellent vehicle. I believe its well made. Its not falling apart. No problems with it, except the airbag malfunction warning light being on all of a sudden and the cigarette lighter went out to plug in things, but it does have 2 other plugs ins for the cell phone. 
Also the roof window is being slow to close so I just dont open it anymore. 
It could be the fuses.
 These minor problems need to be checked.
The warranty was very short because supposedly things changed when the dealership got sold.
Therefore I don't care about the dealership.
I will buy somewhere else next time.
I bought this vehicle because it fits.
 It's easy to get on and off."
"05 23, 2022",A Great SUV,"I bought my 2016 RAV4 AWD Limited in late December, 2015.  I really Ike this car.  It's easy to enter and exit. The numerous convenience and safety features are great.  It has been very reliable. I love the self-dimming headlights and the technology package.  The warning when another car is in my blindspot is a great feature."
"05 10, 2022",Great Job,Hands down. The crew here was very helpful and they really worked with us and they were very detailed and understanding. They made sure we were comfortable and made sure we came off the lot with a vehicle. If you ever question the decision of what is right for you just meditate a moment and let God do his thing❗️
"04 29, 2021",Poor door design,Toyota has made a poor door design on the RAV4.  Mud and snow get inside of the doors.  Especially troubling when road salt or manure from rural roads gets in.
"04 19, 2021","Uncomfortable, noisy and unreliable","After 5 years of ownership, here is my list of issues with the RAV4:
- Terrible ride, stiff, bouncy, every small imperfection in pavement feel like hitting a speed bump
- Loud.  The engine whine is terrible, noisy and very unpleasant.
- Uncomfortable seats, they are tiny.  I'm 5'7, 155 lb, and still feel like sitting on a kiddie chair.  I can't imagine anybody over 6' and 200 lb ever fitting in these seats.
- Rear legroom is very bad for a car it this class.  My daughter's SOUL has more legroom than the RAV.
- Cheap materials and construction.  The interior rattles and squeaks like a cheap 1980 subcompact
- And last but not least - unreliable.  Mine started dripping oil from the front differential area 2 years after purchase.  Fixed by the dealer under warranty it held for 3 years.  1 month before warranty expired it started leaking again.  It took 4 repair trips and over 20 days in the shop, a new transfer case and a new transmission to finally correct a small oil leak.  Toyota covered it under powertrain warranty, but it it happened 1 month later I would be out of $8k in repairs.  Toyota customer service was terrible, it took them days to decide what to do, they nickeled-and-dimed the whole process.  The ""case manager"" was rude and unhelpful.
Bottom line - I am STRONGLY warning against buying a 4th generation (2013-2019) RAV4. Overpriced, cheaply made and unreliable.  Stay away."
"04 17, 2021",Great car for the money,The car is really very nice.  I traded in my 2017 Highland Limited and purchased the 2016 Rav4 SE.  The Rav4 is very comfortable and it meets all my requirements.

"08 16, 2020","No issues, very dependable..",Love this SUV(2016 RAV4 se fwd). Plenty of room especially the back trunk space. Only thing I have to say is I only get 20 mpg combined? Not sure why. Maybe the A/C . I'll be lucky to get 300 miles a full tank and that's going grandpa mode. Other than that Love it. Looking into a Hybrid Rav4. Totally Recommend It.
"08  4, 2020",My New Daily Driver,"We LOVE this car!  We had a 2016 Jeep Renegade that we traded in for this just for the interior comforts alone.  While I loved my Jeep, this is just as fun but in a better quality vehicle."

"06 24, 2020",Over priced and miss major parts,"During the purchase I was over priced over $2000 more from any dealer. Even if I purchase a new car I have got a copy car not the original one, car trunk and headlight uninstall a back interior trunk cover missis so use of high AC interior padding very poor rain & rod vamp loud. Only out side look is good but boorly manufactured the rear door booth part the glue came off from the metal never seen in any car that. The eco part is horrible it makes the ride bumpy to sow he it back normal not easy... $3400 with 2300 down payment is not worse at lol"

"05 23, 2020",Toyota for the win!,"Just purchased a pre-owned Rav4 through Crown Toyota in Lawrence. Although a 2016, it has just 22k miles on it and looks new inside and out. It corners like a sports car! Lots of room to haul stuff since the rear seats can be flattened out."

I have followed Toyota's recommended maintenance schedule religiously and after almost four years, have experienced no serious issues. I have made several long distance road trips in this vehicle and would not hesitate to drive it across country and back. I now have 70,000 trouble-free miles on it and fully expect to get at least another 70,000."
"02 12, 2020",Plane vanilla dependability,"It’s ok. I expect good reliability from a Toyota. The styling is pretty mundane, but my wife likes it. I think it’s designed for women primarily. It’s definitely not very masculine."

"09 16, 2019",Love it but noises on rough roads,Love it . It’s very noisy and trying to speak to electronics to make phone call asks you to repeat til it turns itself off. I’d rather would have bought Camry instead. Seat adjustments to raise seats seem really cheap in XLE.

I love Toyota’s and have always been impressed! It has taken me a little bit to get use to the new blind spots. Overall love it!"
"12 17, 2018",Always a solid choice in a SUV,"I’v owned several Toyota’s and their always dependable.  The RAV4 gets decent gas mileage, is easy to get in and out of, and it’s great in snow!  It comfortable to ride in and everything is laid out nicely.  It’s a solid overall vehicle."
"12 16, 2018",Another excellent Toyota vehicle,"We are on our 3rd Sienna in 18 years and all have been extremely reliable and safe (2nd Sienna was totaled).  When it came to buying a vehicle for one of my kids to inherit, we looked only at Toyotas.

They don't recline flat, but enough for kid/teen to be comfy on road trips. Reliable Toyota. Met great safety ratings. The lights are bright (LED), to the point other drivers think u have your brights on, that part is annoying, but when traveling through countryside at night it's excellent! It also has off road capability, AWD great for ice & rain. The Eco feature is great for fuel efficiency when I'm in traffic, which is daily. Sun roof is fun.

"05 26, 2018",No seatbelt in the middle of back seat.,"Purchased late 2017 and although I love everything thus far, we had an event that 5 of us were going to this morning only to find out that there were only FOUR SEATBELTS in the vehicle no middle back seat belt, which meant that one of us could not go. It is too far for the driver to come back to pick me up as it was a drive from Pickering to Hamilton! Very frustrating. Toyota will be hearing about this. Shameful!"

"04 27, 2018",Slow car I have owned,The transmiision has trouble finding right  gear  on highway with cruise control on.  Radio is diffcult to use.  The engine is hard to keep at speed.
"04 26, 2018",Rav 4 won?t disappoint,"The Rav is comfortable, interior looks far more expensive. Two winters has proved its stability.   Fit and finish top notch.  No mechanical issues just normal maintenance."

It is great on gas and I have not had a problem with the car.  A few features should be incorporated and not an option like automatic seat on the driver side
"04  4, 2018",Toyota RAV4,The car meet and exceeds all of my needs. It is comfortable and fun to drive. Lot of leg room in the front and back seat areas. No blind spots in the side mirrors making it very safe to drive in traffic.
"03 20, 2018",Overpriced,"Strong points: lot's of cargo space, decent performance, reliable
Weak points: terrible ride, uncomfortable seats (front and back), interior feels cramped for the size of vehicle (tiny seats, little shoulder room, little rear leg room), cheap interior with lot's of hard plastic.
Overall, extremely overpriced.  Feels like riding in a $15k subcompact.  Considering the price Toyota is asking for the RAV it's very poor value-for-money.  I expect much better comfort and quality from a vehicle priced $25-30k.  The RAV would be a decent car if it was priced 15% lower."
"03  9, 2018",Most reliable car I've owned.. And i love it!!,This car really has been an amazing upgrade from tha expedition i had before.. Sane payments for a better an warrantied car!! Toyota is #1

"02 22, 2018",Is good car,Is very good car very comfortable I really like this car enough space in side to all good  white color outside and black color inside
"02 17, 2018",RAV4 is overrated,I paid too much for my car at first I was excited to get it but now it seems like it's a really small I've also had a quite a numerous repairs to be done in it to it in the two years that I've owned it so far it's a good car but it's not a great car
"02 12, 2018",I love it!,"This vehicle is my dream car. It has great handling, which is a must when I live in South Dakota and it?s snowing most of the time. It?s a great crossover, and has excellent interior and exterior styling. I love Toyota, it is a very reliable brand. I can?t wait to own this vehicle for a very long time!"
"01 27, 2018",Best car I?ve ever owned,This car has the best safety features. I?ve owned lots of cars before but non of them top my RAV4. It?s a safe family car and has lots of room.
"01  5, 2018","Reliable, not in winter months.","2016 rav4 se, you can't drive it in snow, no traction.  2"" of snow and slides all over, almost hit a car going 4 miles per hour.  Took to dealer, salesman said you need to buy snow tires for the se model to drive in snow.  Cruise control in odd place, hand on steering wheel when you turn it hits it.  Rough ride, hit bumps or potholes it rocks you and you hear loud bangs - Evan at slow speeds."
"12 11, 2017",Amazing,"It was fun to drive . Snow on roads and it handle well .  Gunned it , it excelled quickly.  Handle turns well ."
"12 11, 2017",Amazing car !,I am so fortunate to own this car .  It meets all my needs .  Over all appearance is awesome . Drives smooth .  Best car I have ever own .
"12  8, 2017",Mom Loves It!,This vehicle is the perfect vehicle for a busy Mom.  It has plenty of seat room and great storage.  The fold down seats give so much hauling space.  #great value #groovy moms
"11 25, 2017",At 80 years old I've never owned a car as great,"In love with my RAV4.  I'm keeping it forever, and I'm sure it will outlast me.
As for service, no one touches my baby, but Toyota."
"11 15, 2017",Best car ever.,I love my RAV4.  It is smooth and safe.  I never have to worry about it breaking down because I know and trust Toyota.  Really roomy.  Once fit 3 car seats in the back.
"10 16, 2017",Very good deal,"This car met my expectation !!!
Exactly what I was looking for.
I'd recommend others to buy it, very economic !!!!"
"10  7, 2017",Tough Little Car,Second time I had this vehicle. I loved the way it handled itself during snow storms. No problems. Toughest little car that I have ever driven.
"09 26, 2017",So far it has been good! I like it a lot,It drives well and it is roomy. I like the interior design of it. This is just perfect for me and my wife to drive every day.
"09 18, 2017",test dive 2016 Rav4,I had the pleasure in driving the rav4. The design was sleek. The ride was average.   Roomy interior for people . I measured the cargo space side by side with another suv and It was about 2 inches diffrent.  Quiet when I push on the gas. Driving radius was good.  Overall a good solid suv.
"09 12, 2017",Love my rav4,This is my third RAV4 since 1998. It is the perfect vehicle Sporty and fancy mixed together. Great on gas and reliable! Very happy with this purchase.
"09  6, 2017",Enjoyed my new RAV 4.,"This car came with a tow package, which was important since I have a small trailer used for towing my ATV.  It performs very well, and I am pleased with the design, response, and pricing. 
If the mpg were just a bit better it would be perfect, but overall it is a great vehicle.  I'm glad the spare tire was moved from the back of the car on this model."
"09  5, 2017",A good buy!,"This car has met all my needs. Great stereo system, smoothest car i've driven. Great on milage, better than my old car!"
"09  1, 2017",Rav 4,Not a bad ride. It's kinda smaller than I thought it was going to be. Should be compared to the Forester not the Outback. lol
"08 21, 2017",Good looking with good gas mileage,"I feel good driving this vehicle...comfortable, good gas mileage, perfect size and everything I need is right at my fingertips"
"08 15, 2017",Best bang for your buck,"This car is really fun to drive while being dependable at thesame time. Gas millage is not bad for its size and capabilities.  It's a Toyota,  you can't go wrong with it.  Best value for my money."
"08 14, 2017",Awesome looking Vehicle,"The RAV4 2106 SE AWD is one of the best vehicles I have owned. Fun, easy and a breeze to drive. Not to mention the sporty look on the SE trim that makes it stand out from the rest of the crowd. I love it."
"07 31, 2017",Most excellent,"Looking for a suv most reliable 
Attractive after test drive ing
Now in the market for the new purchase
Very attractive most beautiful"
"07 31, 2017",I love it,"Ive had a corolla for years that has over 220k miles on it , so I decided to get this. It is quite a step up!"
"07 30, 2017",Dissapointing and overpriced,"This is a second RAV we own. The first one was a 2013, which I sold after only one year of ownership due to the same issues I will address below. With the 2016 facelift we decided to give it another try. 

The RAV would be a great vehicle if Toyota priced it for what it's worth. It's spacious and has a decent amount advanced features such as Toyota Safety Sense front collision avoidance system. Bit this is where good things end. RAV's comfort and noise level are what one would expect from a $15,000 subcompact, not a car that sells for twice that amount. The ride is terrible, the seats are OK-ish, rear legroom is disappointing for the type and size of vehicle, the AWD is the worst in its class (see CR review). On top of that, the interior is cheap-looking, full of hard plastic. The only redeemable details is the amount of cargo space. Net, it's the worst Toyota vehicle we have owned and it's enough to seriously put us off from buying another Toyota in the future (after owning a total of 7). Toyota could and should have done a better job with the RAV."
"07 28, 2017",very reliable,"all around excellent for the price. little noisy though on concrete roadways. this is the 3rd rav4 we have owned and all were reliable and comfortable. you sit up ""high"" to view the roadway."
"07 21, 2017",Great car,"The car has just enough pick-up, quiet interior. The drivers seat could be a little more comfortable. The headlights are the only negative. They are not bright enough."
"07 21, 2017",great handling car..  easy to get in and out of,plenty of room.  rode better than any others I test drove.  Does not lose speed going up mountains.  Good gas mileage for SUV.
"07 11, 2017","Love the look, safety ratings, mileage","Nice driving experience, love the gas mileage, ease of learning all of the bells and whistles, bluetooth option is the best I have experienced"
"07  9, 2017",2016 RAV4 in Excellent Condition,RAV4 is an excellent family car with plenty of space and offers complete peace of mind and reliability on the road.
"06 16, 2017",The best SUV in the market for price,"TOYOTA is always a part of my life for their reliability, comfort and fuel economy. I put around 25000 miles on a RAV4 and it was always the amazing experience while I go on adding miles to it. I test drove other SUVs of the same class but found RAV4 to be the best."
"06 16, 2017",Nissian X-Terra,My Rav 4 XLE/AWD is 6 months old; the transmission was not engaging correctly.  I took it to the dealer and toyota said they would replaced it with a REFURBISHED transmission.   There warranty is very deceptive and the reliability of the vehicles isn't what it once was.   Very disappointed :(
"06  9, 2017",2016 RAV4 LE AWD,"Great car, very comfortable to drive in and for passengers in back seat. So much room inside! 

The AWD is awesome in bad weather. Love the updates Toyota did to the exterior, much sleeker looking. 

Only thing I would like to see improvement made upon is MPG. Car is listed 22-29mpg and we have been getting 24mpg, which is fine but we only get 260 miles on a tank. 

Either need to improve MPG or provide the car with a bigger tank."
"05 30, 2017",LOVE this crossover....,"I love this new, used car.  It's not the most powerful right out of the gate. But, comfort, quieter than my Scion xB and interior are really nice.  Frankly, in my many years of cars, this is the nicest car I've owned to date.  It's versatile, dog, garden needs and people etc.  Leather seats, with this used XLE model. Great gas mileage; nearly 30+ MPH a gallon on the highway.  Worth you time to take a look and test drive."
"05 26, 2017",Most reliable car I've had!,Met all my needs in every aspect. Tons of space for what I needed including 2nd row seats that were also reclinable.
"05 20, 2017","Safe, reliable transportation","Good value in a nice looking, comfortable and reliable package.  The XLE could have used some features from the Limited version, I.e. Keyless start, heated seats, luggage cover and other safety features and 'nice to have' offered by the competition."
"05 20, 2017",This is the a great car so far.,"I love this cars. It is very spacious, lots leg room. The seats in the back recline, and i am sure my passengers will love that. The drive is smooth, and quite."
"05 15, 2017",Best safety features i've ever experienced,"The Toyota Rav4 is a safe, economical, but fun SUV to drive.  With features such as lane departure warning and blind spot alerts the Rav4 has taken safety to another level."
"05 13, 2017",Great car!,"Great car, running the SE fully loaded and enjoy just driving around with music blasting.  The only addition I would recommend is getting rain guards for the windows as even having the windows open a tiny bit while raining, water works its way in, but very minor. (Last car had them and got used to it). 

Definitely recommend to other though."
"04 25, 2017",Most incredible car I've leased,Best car ever that I've leased in the past 7 years so far that I have. I haven't made a choice to lease another car or just buy my beauty
"04 25, 2017",I love driving my new Toyota RAV 4 !,"My new Toyota RAV 4, Drives great! It Gets good Gas mileage. It is Very stylish and  Practical... I am looking forward to many years of service with this Vehicle!!!"
"04 20, 2017",love this car!!!,"its comfortable, not too big, not too small, excellent gas millage, love the new design without the spare tire in the back. I'd recommend this car to anyone."
"04 20, 2017","Great, affordable SUV","I have no complaints about my RAV4 except I wish it had a little more power when you have to accelerate quickly and when you go up hills and mountains. Other than that it's a great, affordable SUV!"
"04 19, 2017",Looks just like the much more expensive Lexus,"I like all the safety features offered in this vehicle. Gets really good gas milage and has a nice ride, have enjoyed my car so far."
"04 15, 2017",Good small suv,"I like 2016 Rav4 i bought, but it needs more light interior even in LE model, because you can not see inside at all while driving at night"
"04  4, 2017",Outstanding AWD Duel Economy,"We purchased the 2016 Rav 4 LE in AWD about 6 months ago and just went on our first long distant highway drive (250 no stop miles) and my wife and I were pleasantly surprised that we averaged  31.1 miles per gallon and I verified it by filling up with about 8.4 gallons of gas after completing the 250 mile drive. 

We were in Eco Mode and occasionally used cruse control and about 20% of the drive included a two lane canyon road with lots of  climbing and descending. 

We mostly drive our Rav 4 to the grocery store and other in town short drives and in normal mode we can expect just under 24 mpg city driving which is the EPA estimate  but 31.1 Hwy is 2 mpg better than the EPA of 29 Hwy. 

We owned a 2008 Honda Accord and on the highway we would average 29 mpg.  My wife and I would have never imagined eight years later a SUV AWD would be more economical. 

I recently read in Cars.com in real world driving the Honda CRV 2017 Turbo was delivering just under 32 mpg Hwy but city driving was barely over 20 mpg

Average out city and hwy driving and our base model Rav 4 2016 model is out performing in real world fuel consumption the top-of-the-line touring Honda 2017 CRV Turbo and we paid $12,000 less. 

Thanks Toyota"
"04  3, 2017",Love at first sight,"Shopping for new car after 14 yrs, saw this one on showroom floor had to have it! Perfect for me. Was lucky enough to get great Product Specialist Greg who walked me through the entire process, couldn't be happier"
"04  3, 2017",Best SUV in snow,I had to drive to work when there's 6-7 inches of snow on the ground! RAV4 gives me the confidence!!
"04  1, 2017","Sporty, Reliable, and fully loaded with features.","Pros:  Great Safety Features, makes you feel safe.  Great colors to choose from.  Nicely  laid out interior. Roomy.  Good ride.  AWD works well.
Cons:  Weak interior lighting.  Engine is a little noisy.
Summary:  Great Vehicle..."
"03 31, 2017","Rav 4 is my favorite car, this is my third one.",Excellent sports utility and most comfortable vehicle to drive anywhere in the world. I was fully satisfied with my previous two Rav 4 s.
"03 31, 2017",I love Toyota's reliability,We have a 1998 Toyota 4runner that has 264k miles. We are confident we will get that out of our new Rav4.
"03 18, 2017",nice buy,"nice rav4 i like the car is very comfortable easy to drive and funny, cheaper in gas .
family car enough space"
"03 14, 2017",First SUV...,This is my first SUV and first foreign car also. So far after 4 months I love my Rav4. It has everything I want and it was awesome in the snow.
"03 11, 2017",I love my new car!,"The RAV4 is perfect for me. Right down to the color (hot lava), I couldn't have picked a better car for myself at this time in my life."
"03 10, 2017",NewRav4,"Arlington Toyota, Jacksonville, Fl- Great place to buy a veichle.. I took my sister to buy corolla 16 and we loved dealing with Danny. I went there again because of that and Danny and Richie helped me this time. They both were great! Even though there was a confusion and almost returned my new RAV4 but they worked it all out.. 
overall happy so thank you.."
"03  6, 2017",Driver,"Over priced car with limited accessories . The car interior is built  very cheap , seating is very small. Price is higher than its peers"
"03  6, 2017",Disappointed,"I traded in a 2010 RAV for a 2016 and wish I never had. While the 2016 has many great safety features, handles well, and gets decent mileage, it is so uncomfortable I hate to get in a drive it."
"03  5, 2017",I love it!,"I plan to purchase this car two years ago when it was still the 2015 version. 2016 is a great improvement and I like it even better!

The interior is amazing when I switched from my Solara convertible. It is young, attractive, and surprisingly quiet.

The fuel economy is so-so based on the 2.5L engine. I would expect a 25 mpg combined while used the car for commuting. 

Overall, it is an excellent vehicle. And I love it!"
"02 24, 2017",Very nice.,We have a 2016 RAV4 SE. The car is great in every way except that the headlights are not automatic and have to be turned off manually when exiting the vehicle. We plan to trade it for a 2017 Limited which has all of the features we want. The SE does have paddles for manually shifting which would be great for going off road.
"02 16, 2017",New breaks before 10k mi,"Overall, I'm trying to not regret buying the Rav4 '16...although the reasons seem minor but when the breaks gave me issues, I panicked. 
The driver door gave an extra click from the beginning and kept worsening over time. 
Then when I braked on packed snow, ALB kicked in, as expected, no issues. 1 week later, as I was braking in the AM, I felt and heard a light & quiet roll. I took it in and was told the breaks were ""extremely rusty"". The breaks and rotors were replaced.  At the same time, the interior part of the door handle was replaced. No issues since, thank God!
Today, driving on the hwy, I came across a puddle, ALB kicked in but lasted longer-meaning I felt like my car was shaking under the hood and extra couple seconds. I had to slow down to about 40mph and it slowly went away.
About 80 mi later, tire pressure light came on. No tires appear low but I'll check the measurements tomorrow AM.
I'm SO sad that I car that I've heard only the best about is giving me issues. What's worse than having safety concerns with a new Rav4 was going to the dealership and being completely belittled because I couldn't ""replicate the sound "" on demand. He saw the issue with his eyes once he lifted the vehicle, just after I called him out on his behavior. No apologies were heard but at least he looked at the car. 
I'm NOT looking forward to going back tomorrow."
"02  3, 2017",Best value for car and comfort,"I bought Rav4 Limited in 2016 May. I have clocked around 7000 miles. It is one a very comfortable and easy to handle SUV. I was waiting to see interior quality behavior after 7-8 months. I am amazed with interior quality - it feels like new still. I have read many reviews that it does not have enough power. I have not had this experience. If you drive the first 1000 miles without ramming accelerator - vehicle performance is so different after first oil change service. Some reviews claimed it little Noisy but, I am surprised with those reviews. It is absolutely not noisy. CRV and Nissan Rogue were my other choices. CRV had a little stiffer and heavier steering than Rav4 and CVT did not make me feel good. Rogue was good in everything but, somehow reliability pushed me to buy Toyota Rav4. 

I am not regretting the choice because 7-8 months old Rogue looks and drives different than a Toyota. Fuel efficiency is little less when compared to CRV. I do not drive a lot so (on an average 800-900 miles a month), this was not a big factor for me. What I loved about was steering handling and driver seat comfort. I think this has the best driver seat comfort in this segment. 

I have not driven the 2017 CRV yet. But, until end of 2016 - this is the best Small cross over SUV one can get and never regret about it."
"01 28, 2017",Love our 2016 Rav 4,"Love all the new things on this Rav 4. We get one every fourth year. We love how you can haul things in the back, new navigation onboard, leather seats, push button different power modes, and great style. We love it!"
"11 30, 2016",Class Act!,We have a 2014 RAV4 XLE and just purchased a 2016.Excellent performance and gas mileage as promised with Lexus fit and finish at a Toyota price tag!
"11  8, 2016",so so,Not like my previous 2010 LE.  I have the ?E now no comparison.  Interior black can't see anything.  Manual lights on and off.  No locking system from outside.  Hate the rear door liked it much better when it opened like a Door.  Good performance good body lines.
"10 15, 2016",Go see Buz Arbogast at Steven Toyota!,"Thank you Buz Arbogast for finding me the right vehicle, at an affordable price, that also fit my needs!  The RAV4 will be a huge asset to have during the snowy winter months as well as the hot summer months with its efficient gas mileage!  You treated me fair and respectful and for that, I thank you.  You have earned my business in the future.  Thank you again, from a happy customer."
"09 10, 2016",2016 Toyota Rav4,Outstanding safety features and extremely comfortable vehicle.  Like the blind spot monitoring system.  Corwin dealership and salesman Reza Kamran took time to make sure I knew how this vehicle worked.  I really like how the vehicle handles.
"09  2, 2016",RAV4 Great car,"This is my second RAV4- we could not be happier.

I highly recommend it...

Fantastic SUV.....

Great pick up, good on gas mileage

Super in the snow.

Nice new features on the Nav"
"07 23, 2016",needs to have a light color interior offered,I ALMOST SWITCHED BRANDS BECAUSE OF NO OPTION FOR THE COLOR OF THE INTERIOR ON THE BASE MODEL. BLACK IS THE WORSE COLOR YOU CAN HAVE FOR THE INTERIOR--I ALWAYS BUY A VEHICLE WITH LIGHTER COLOR INTERIOR. TOYOTA NEEDS TO GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER.
"07 11, 2016",Great Vehicle,This is better than I expected. The gas mileage is 27+mpg combined. Performance is excellent and it seems to be an all around great car.. Ask me again in a year as I have only possessed this RAV4 for a couple weeks. The only fault I have with the car is the lift gate. It starts difficulty to open and then kinda springs up. You must be careful or you may be impacted in the face. No other complaints at this time.
"07  1, 2016",Best model yet,"Over the years we have purchased six Rav 4's with all unique features and options.
We purchased a Rav 4 2015 last year because of our fondness.  While having our vehicle serviced I decided to try the new 2016, Wow!!! I did not think there would be that much difference in vehicles, wrong! We love our new Rav 4 with all the new features they added to the 2016. New headlights, new instrumentation, sun glass holder, better ride, awesome cruise control features, larger backup camera monitor, rear and front sensors, upgraded leather, and awesome style. The only con is we did not realize they eliminated the cd player."
"05  5, 2016",Great car,"I just  purchased my first Toyota Rav 4 and I love it!  The color (electric blue) is awesome and I get many compliments on it.  The seats are comfortable and there is a lot of leg room, even in the back seats!!  I have black leather interior and it goes well with the blue outside.   The audio system sounds better than any one I have previously owned  I also love the navigation system. .  It has more power than my other Rav 4s and I still have to get used to the power in this car  All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase  I love this car!!"
"04 21, 2016",new 2016 rav 4 limited,"We love this model!!  The Rav 4 limited has everything. Smooth and comfortable ride, easy to get in and out of, sporty stylish look, and comes with all the toys. Would highly recommend this vehicle, you'll be glad you did!!"
"04 12, 2016",3600 miles and loving it,I bought a 2016 Toyota RAV 4 SE back in January and so far so good! The interior is plush and sophisticated and I love my standard sun roof on sunny days. The performance of the car could be a little better in terms of power but it gets me from point A to point B. I can see myself owning this RAV4 for years to come.
"03 28, 2016",Best SUV For The Money,"We absolutely love our new Rav4 XLE! I would recommend this to anyone considering this size and type of vehicle! Performance and r eliability is what it is all about and mileage to boot, the ONLY thing we wish it had is a cd player!"
"03 14, 2016",I like the vehicle.,"You should not be able to lock the keys in the car in the available technology of today.  Also, ALL cars should have smart key with push button start.  I am disappointed with the dealer ship.  Although the salesmen were great."
"03 12, 2016",Great product,"Car is really nice and comfortable, I love it.  Got a lot of space.  Driving feels really excellent and smooth"
"03  4, 2016",Best money I've spent,"I recently purchased a 2016 RAV4 from Stadium Toyota of Tampa. I absolutely live it! There is a ton of storage space. It rides so smooth. The technology is amazing. My salesman Raymond Martinez was wonderful and made sure that I knew how to use the navigation, Bluetooth, back-up camera, HD radio, XM radio, and all of the rest of the technology. This car is absolutely worth every penny!"
"02  5, 2016",The absolute best!,"This is an incredibly comfortable SUV with the driving experience of a luxury car. A very quiet vehicle on the road, smooth, with excellent handling. The back seats tilt back for comfort, fold forward for extra room easily with one hand. The winter floor mats are great, rivaling the kind advertised in aftermarket purchase to keep your car clean and dry. The seats are very comfortable, with adjustable seat belts that don't feel as if you will be strangled when worn (a problem for shorter stature people). Handling in snow, slush, ice is excellent with its AWD. Love this vehicle!"
"02  3, 2016",The best car I have ever owned or driven.,"This is the first car I have ever bought brand new. I never thought I would ever own a new car, now I do and I love it. It drives, rides, and even smells amazingly awesome. This is the best investment I have ever done for myself. The car is stylish, handles great, great gas mileage, drives and rides smooth. Great, great, great car."
"01 22, 2016",looks and feels great,"we like it. it drives, looks, and feels great. we give it five stars on everything. right now i wouldn't swap it for any other model."
"01 22, 2016",First SUV,"I now understand why there are so many of these automobiles on the road. I did not drive the vehicle before I bought, I could tell I was going to love it just by riding in the backseat. I was not wrong, the ride sold me. Each time I drive it I'm more and more happy I chose this car. The back up camera feature is very helpful, what did I do without it. The car is so solid and easy to zip through traffic."
"01  8, 2016",Excellant,"We recently bought the limited edition, and couldn't be happier. The mileage is 27/31 MPH. It is beautifully designed, very comfortable, the options in the limited is worth the extra money. If you are looking for a new crossover and you don't try the RAV4 you will be cheating yourself. I did not mention reliability because Toyota's reputation speaks for it's self. If the limited is in your budget, you should drive it. We traded the 2013 RAV4 XLE which was very similar but the interior options are better in the limited."
"12 17, 2015",Easily the best SUV in the market,"I purchased my 2016 RAV4 SE model last Thursday. I couldn't be any happier with the quality and performance of this vehicle.

If you're in the market for an SUV. Please go to your local Toyota dealer for a test drive. I guarantee you will be impressed also :)"
"11 30, 2015","THE CAMRY IS MY FAVORITE, IT IS WONDERFUL, BUT THE",THE RAV-4 IS NOT UP TO THE QUALITY OF THE CAMRY WHEN IT COMES TO RIDE AND PERFORMANCE. I ALSO NEED AN SUV THAT CAN TOW AT LEAST 2200 LBS. STILL LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT SUV.

This car is absolutely worth every penny!"
"02  5, 2016",The absolute best!,"This is an incredibly comfortable SUV with the driving experience of a luxury car. A very quiet vehicle on the road, smooth, with excellent handling. The back seats tilt back for comfort, fold forward for extra room easily with one hand. The winter floor mats are great, rivaling the kind advertised in aftermarket purchase to keep your car clean and dry. The seats are very comfortable, with adjustable seat belts that don't feel as if you will be strangled when worn (a problem for shorter stature people). Handling in snow, slush, ice is excellent with its AWD. Love this vehicle!"

"11  9, 2023",Great family vehicle and Reliable,"2017 Rav4 LE FWD bought new.Excellent vehicle- best I have owned. Zero issues of any kind as far as reliability. A little soft around corners, but a nice ride. Very quiet on the highway, getting 32 mpg. 27 city. Lots of storage in the back. Still the original brakes all around with 82K miles."
"11  3, 2023",My car is absolutely beautiful in and out. I love,My car is absolutely beautiful in and out. I love it. I am very happy with the gas mileage that I get. I certainly do recommend this vehicle.
"05  7, 2023",Comparison 2017 Toyota RAV4 XLE vs. Honda,"I purchased this car new for my wife. I drive a 2009 Honda CRV EXL, it has 135,000 miles without any repairs. When I went looking for a new CRV for my wife I found that Honda went to the small engine with turbo and a CVT transmission…..I wouldn’t buy this excuse for a car.  When I looked in 2009 for a car, the RAV4 was my second choice. So I looked in March 2017, I bought my wife a new RAV4 XLE, FWD (front wheel drive), 2.5L, 6 speed automatic transmission.  The RAV4 currently has 78,000 miles and hasn’t had any problems. This car is as close to my CRV as possible. When I bought it there was a $3500 rebate, so this car cost the same as my CRV did 8 years ago. Both were $26k out the door, incl tax, license, etc. The only thing I didn’t realize when buying the car was that it didn’t have a power drivers seat and a power lift gate. When I researched the car, I saw a video that showed both of these were included. Turns out that it was a Canadian model, not a USA model The car was made in Ontario, Canada for the USA. I live in a tNW suburb of Chicago, and the front wheel drive only model is perfect in this area. My wife’s old car was a 2006 Honda Accord EXL and she never had problems driving in the snow with it.  Suggestion…..buy new, not used, negotiate on line before showing up at the dealer, don’t buy any add on’s, don’t buy extended warranty’s."
"06 13, 2022","50,000 miles a good car but NOT exceptional","I traded in my 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid that averaged 26 mpg and I really liked the size and excellent performance. 
The 2017 Toyota Rav4 Limited is not as well liked. I get 20mpg locally and 28mpg on the interstate. 
It is not as comfortable as well.
As the expensive model, Toyota has even cut corners on a few things such as not even a light in the glove box, a navigation system that actually works accurately and a Bluetooth that doesn't sound tinny.
I would like to stay with Toyota BUT next time I will be more diligent and check other options"
"04 25, 2022","Short people, get a pillow.","I never had a Toyota and am happy I bought one. Sleek, reliable, nice looking.
The Rav 4 has just about everything I need in a car. The only things that I dont like is;
The seat does not go up HIGH enough, I am 5'2"" and I have to put a pillow under my arse to see over the dashboard. The only other thing... I wish the back wiper had squirtys. It does not and the window gets so dirty."
"04  3, 2022",My Rav 4,"I purchased my car used, for 16 years while I drove my Corolla to death, i desired a Rav. So I went to just browse one morning, the dealer drive me around. I spotted it, drive it, and no other cars. Period. It was a leased vehicle, so maybe why it didn’t have great interior,,, but lots of space. The CD player will only play one disk, cannot load more than one,,, the A/c is lacking some, as was my other Toyota cars, but reliability was and is priority. A woman alone, MUST HAVE , reliable transportation. I’m older than 65, so I wish for a little more than basics, but I would certainly buy a Rav again."
"05 19, 2021",this is the first time I have a car under my name,this car is very nice and they have a sunroof. it's nice I'd love it excellent condition and the price of this car is awesome
"04 27, 2021",Decent,I love the room. could have a better paint job and technology.  great safety measures and insurance cost. my 10 foot kayak fits inside. Priorities!
"04  1, 2021",Good Car,The car has good space inside and drive well.  It is very comfortable to drive and is easy to operate.  The car work well for our family.
"03  9, 2021",Toyota built to last,"Vehicle met all my needs especially all wheel drive that’s New England. Always owned Toyota’s all my life 
Great service Deparment is the key. Would not go to any other dealerships been there they do not care like Toyota West Roxbury"
"03  1, 2021",Great investment,"This car has so much room. I've used it for transporting desks, lounge chairs,floor model weaving looms, just for starters; not to mention loads of groceries. It rides well, saves me a lot as far as gas and maintenance. Totally satisfying experience."
"02 11, 2021",Love my rav,Love my car comfortable however one thing I wish it had is remote start. It is leather interior with heated seats and a sunroof. It is kinda sporty and fun but is easy to put my son in the back seat. The trunk has decent room to put groceries. Just need an organizer for the trunk
"02  3, 2021",Beautiful and well built car,The car is beautifully built with a lot of space especially storage space. The interior is beautiful as well and the color is eye catching
"01 31, 2021",I never have to worry about not starting,"The car meets my need because I never had to worry about the car not starting in the morning, cold weather or warm. However, not only I am paying too much because I leased it first and i am now buying it. The car is too computerized on my opinion because everything cost big money. For example The tires pressure  censor only is almost $140 each. Too expensive to maintain bit it is reliable. A 20.000$ car is now costing me almost 50.000 because I don't know any better. Never leased again, just buy it."
"01 31, 2021",Rav 4 is the best car I have owned.,"This car is just what I wanted. It has good gas mileage, is comfortable, and looks virtually new.  I was glad to find the type of car I wanted in my price range and with the specs on my list."
"01 26, 2021",My winter vehicle,"I think the previous generation looked better but got a great offer on a certified 2017 with 20,000 miles and it gets down the icy roads here in this siberian nightmare called Wisconsin. Try to keep the underbody washed to prevent rust. No problems so far, comfy!"
"01 21, 2021",So far so good,"I have the SE and it’s beautiful inside and out. Drive is smooth and my kids love it. Lots of room in the back. Leather interior, heated seats weather proof floor mats. Pretty decent gas mileage for suv. Love this car."
"12 30, 2020",Great car so far,"So far it has fulfilled my needs. Still to new for me to rate everything. 
Since I’ve had the car for a short time, I am still learning about it. 
The heated steering wheel is very cool."
"11 15, 2020",Nicest car i have ever owned!,"I love my 2017 Rav 4. This was the first car I ever purchased and actually chose. Usually I just settled for whatever I could afford. This time things were different. Rav 4 has every added feature i wanted. It's extremely comfortable, reliable, and safe. I especially love having the switch lane assistance. I recommend test driving a Rav4. I found it to be more comfortable than it's competitors. ***** 5 stars!"
"10 31, 2020",I drive 90 miles a day!,"I never thought I could replace my white 2009 Infiniti; but this RAV4 meets all my needs.  I’ve put over 4,000 miles on it already and love that I sit up high and after the terrifying experience of hydroplaning (towards oncoming traffic) I feel secure"
"10 23, 2020",Realizable,"Good resale value, good miles per gallon , dependable, low repair cost, lots of standard products, great trunk space, comfortable to drive, great interior and exterior styling"
"10 18, 2020",Best vehicle I ever had !!,It is the perfect size vehicle for me. It's nice and has plenty of room on the inside. It is very comfortable to drive. I just love it .
"10 14, 2020",Great car!,I was impressed by the laser guided cruise control that automatically slows to match the vehicle in your lane at a user defined following distance. I was also impressed by the ability to shift from auto to manually shift up and down. I like the backup camera and auto dimming mirror.
"10  8, 2020",Great compact SUV keeps it value,"In past 3yrs owning can’t complain at all. Great on gas , legroom comfortable and trunk space all would fit when shopping. Has 2plug in charge outlets (front n back) plus 2 USB ports."
"10  1, 2020","So far, so good...","With the purchase of this car we made the switch from a CRV, which we have been very happy with.  The newer Crv's have poorer visibility, which is one reason that we made the change.  So far, we are pleased with the design, the interior, the way it handles both in town and on the highway."
"09 23, 2020",Like new,"I was surprised to find a 4 model-year-old car with so few miles. My Rav4 is beautiful, dependable and very comfortable.  It makes my drive in to work less dreadful :)"
"09  8, 2020",We finally bought our dream car!,"Reliability, comfortability, sturdiness, efficiency, and adaptability were a must in the car that was going to replace our Nissan Murano 2007. We couldn't have bought a better replacement. 

The Toyota RAV4 LE 2017 drives like a charm. It is usually very efficient (25-32 mpg), but you it can go the extra mile by activating the Eco Mode. It can even be stealthier when you want to park your car and not wake up your kids with Sport mode. 

It's quiet, comfortable, and it's not huge so it's not an issue to park. 

I'm in love! My friends are too!"
"09  6, 2020",All Wheel Drive,I live in the snowbelt in NE Ohio so I need something that is good on snow covered roads. This car is great. My sister has had 3 Rav 4 vehicles and she loved them.
"09  4, 2020",Most reliable car I”be ever owned,I enjoy driving my Toyota Rav 4 XLE because it sits higher than any vehicle I”be owned which enables me to see better. I”s just the right size for me and my family.
"08 14, 2020",Love it!,"Drives great! I feel very much in control of the road, the interior feels very comfortable . The steering is also very smooth, I like many of the features"
"08 10, 2020",Nicest car i have owned,The most important thing to me is having a power lift gate.  This car has it.  It rides very smoothly.  It will probably take me a little while to get used to it.  But it is not overly complicated.  Am looking forward to driving it for a long time.
"08  2, 2020",Can't go wrong with a RAV4,"The RAV4s have great styling, a nice dashboard layout where everything is easy to find, a lot of room, and I really like the adaptive cruise control as an added safety feature...it slows you down automatically when using cruise control to maintain a safe distance between  you and the car in front of you."
"07 30, 2020",Most comfortable and easy to use vehicle I have ow,I was looking for a vehicle that was easy for me to get in and out of. Met all of my needs. Very well pleased!
"07 27, 2020",Good car,I had this car for 2 years 8 months with 26000 something miles. Had a problem with the rotor and break pads already spent more than $400 they said it wasn’t under warranty.
"07 21, 2020",so glad I own one,love my rav4 best car I've owned yet. Always wanted to own a car I know is reliable and the best part is the backup camera. Oh and i love my sound system and sun/moonroof
"07 20, 2020",Excellent vehicle,This is my 2nd RAV4 and I am very happy with this vehicle! I feel safe and trust in the reliability of what the RAV4 offers!  I trust in the dealership behind this vehicle as well and especially love the RAV4 in the winter for its safety and durability!  Highly recommend!

"06 15, 2020",Great drive,I love the car. This is my first car and I will definitely encourage family and friends to get the model. Very comfortable and easy to drive.
"06 11, 2020",Love this car.,Upgrade from my 2004 Impala. Has get up and go which I thought I would be giving up. Styling and color are amazing. Fun to drive and functional as well.
"06  1, 2020",Most dependable and reliable car I have ever owned,"I love this SUV. It has every thing I need from stylish interior and exterior to roof rack options for my cross country trips, and it’s very zippy too. I have owned this car for 3 years and I love it to this day. I get it serviced regularly and so far I have not had any problems with it. I recommend this car and many other Toyota cars to anyone who is looking for a reliable, comfortable, and exciting vehicle."
"05 31, 2020",Just what I wanted,This car is exactly what I was looking for. I had my Toyota mini van for 12 years so it was hard to get something new. Once I drove my RAV4 I knew it was for me. I was still able to have the spacious room with a smaller car design.
"05 14, 2020",Perfect car,Excellent car - meet all of our needs.  I am very glad we purchased this car.  Perfect choice and it fits in our garage niclely
"05 12, 2020",Best vehicle ever.,"This car is exactly what I was looking for: a smooth and quiet ride, comfortable and adjustable back seats for both my over 6 foot tall son and under five foot daughter, plenty of storage space (even enough for our dogs), with the nicest screen graphics I've seen, and great extra features like the moon roof, fog lights, and roof rack.  My model's interior is a two-toned black and tan, which is very tastefully done, and makes the cabin seem bright and cheerful.  The little extra details (like the stitching on the dashboard, and the streamlined design of the door handles) look nice and upscale.  The size of the whole vehicle is comfortably large, but not overly bulky."
"05  9, 2020",I just Purchased the Vehicle,"What a great ride and a great value.  Priced well,  Looking forward to driving for many years in the future! Has everything on the vehicle that I needed and wanted. I have owned Yota's before and they were very reliable. I don't  know why this would not,"
"05  2, 2020",We love RAV4s,"Love this vehicle. Been driving RAV4s for 10 years. Only car are family has owned over past decade. Reliable, surprisingly roomy, and comfortable.  I recommend this vehicle wholeheartedly"
"04 28, 2020",Nice car and going for all weather,"At list they could have added remote starter cos of winter and cold days  after buying the car to install is expensive. I wish I choose one with remote starter, another than that I love it"
"04 24, 2020",Replaced our previous RAV,"Replaced our 2007 RAV FWD with a clean one-owner 2017 from Walser. Great car, sure we will love it. Would have preferred Toyota retain the 60/20/20 rear seat fold, and the corner cubbyholes & other storage options, but it is what it is. Allows us to continue our car game of ""there's another red RAV4."""
"04  5, 2020",Second best RAV4 I ever bought.,Awesome vehicle. I now own 2 RAV4’s. Best cars I have ever owned. Howard Cullen sold me both cars. Thank you Howard . Looking forward to buying another RAV4 in the future from you
"03 20, 2020","Metallic Purple, love it!","Great seats, very comfortable, color is gorgeous, rides very smooth, and has lots of room. Couldn't be happier... Gavin got me exactly what I asked for and more! All the extras were just a bonus, back up camera, lane radar, and cruise control radar. Very nice. The price was surprisingly very reasonable."
"03 18, 2020",My first car purchase,"I had another car, but this my first purchase. This car is great for my work. Very pleased with it.  I absolutely love it !"
"03 15, 2020",GREAT GREAT GREAT,Met all our needs. Gas friendly.  Speed. Comfort perfect little suv for a family of 4 with room for vacation and groceries love it yes.
"03 11, 2020",:uv our Rave4 SE,"Have had this car for almost 3 years, and just ""luv"" almost everything about it.  Plan on keeping it for many years to come.  If we do buy another, it will most likely be an SUV Toyota"
"03  8, 2020","Best Looking Car For Me, So Far!","The interior and exterior of this RAV 4 is beautiful! It has enough room and provides an excellent ride! I wanted a RAV 4 for a while now, and am so happy to finally have one! I love it!"
"03  5, 2020",Great value for my money,"Is it the most comfortable? No. Does it perform the best? No. Best technology? No. It does, however, do everything I need it to do to a satisfactory extent while being a cheap car with some added tech (that came standard) that I really love. I would definitely recommend this car to someone else. My only thing is that I bought a base level vehicle and I would suggest someone maybe get a higher trim with more comfortable seats."
"03  4, 2020",Love this car!,"Our previous car was a Toyota Highlander which we loved, but was too big for us as we ste downsizing. This car has all the features that we loved in the Highlander, but in a more compact form."
"02 16, 2020",Fun car to drive!,"We ended up buying the 2017 Limited edition.  We were happy to find a car with heated seats!  The  cub holders are in somewhat awkward positions and we were a little disappointed that the passenger seat is not electric. However, the rest of the car's features are great!  We are very happy with our purchase!"
"02 10, 2020",I Love My RAV4,"This vehicle has everything you need from pick up groceries, picking up family from the airport to driving around with your dog.  I loved my Rav4 so much I decided to buy it out when my lease expired."
"02  9, 2020",Stylish yet practical SUV!,"This SUV meets all of my needs and is the perfect size - not too big, not too small. I feel safe driving this vehicle and I enjoy all the extra features, plus the AWD for the winter. I plan on driving this vehicle until the wheels fall off!"
"02  8, 2020",I will only drive TOYOTA!,This is my second RAV4 and I love it. I used to have 2003 Rav 4 with 235k miles but that got totaled in an accident and there was no doubt about which car I’d get after that. It was another RAV4. They’re reliable and love their style.
"01 30, 2020",Pleasure driving,"I have only had the car for 1 day,  I am very happy so far ..many great features, such as the head lights on auto..and the eco and sport mode"
"01 29, 2020",Third Toyota owned!,It was everything I was looking for in a new vehicle! I had Toyota Camry's mostly before and was a little hesitant about getting into SUVs but this is just the right size for me and the AWD is such a big thing to have during the winter months where I live!
"01 25, 2020",Love my Toyota,"Great car with great Unbelievable Deal, GREAT COMFORT, A CAR THAT I WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH MY NEW DRIVER DRIVING, GREAT GAS USAGE, VERY PEPPY"
"01 23, 2020",Excited to experience a Toyota,"I have never owned a Toyota but did some homework before purchasing. I am impressed so far with everything about the vehicle. I am used to a bit larger SUV, so the size is taking some time to get used to. The features are wonderful with plenty of USB ports and display screen for music, apps, etc. I really like the lane assist feature and the ECO mode feature."
"01 22, 2020",Really pleased with me purchase,"Lots of leg room and plenty of space for passengers. Love the all wheel drive, and good gas mileage. Power in acceleration is great. Love my Rav4"
"01 17, 2020",It was not an easy choice but was worth it,It is very stylish and really neat and clean.it also has a low mileage and a clean title. The color is also very cool and befitting
"01 16, 2020",Rav4 / Good Purchase,"I had driven trucks for a number of years and enjoyed not having to “scrunch” down into a car.  I am a tall woman and I have to tilt my head a little to get into the Rav, but it is high enough off the ground that I am not lowering myself to climb in.  My Rav is comfortable, with plenty of leg space, even in the back seat.  I decided on a Toyota after checking the room in back and their service set-up. Another deciding factor was,  I had also spoken to my Dad about reliability, as he knew his cars.  He verified that Toyota was putting out quality vehicles.  My Rav has been trouble free and enjoy driving it. Better gas mileage than my Dodge Ram, of course!"
"01 11, 2020",As safe as my Volvo makes me feel,GREAT GAS MILEAGE AND GREAT PICK UP AND GO... hugs the road And I LIKE THAT!!... very spacious AND comfy...my 70lb pitbull loves to go for rides 🐾💕🙏🎶👍😘☂️🌎
"01  8, 2020",Feel safe in the vehicle,"Originally purchased a 2016 RAV4, had a person run a red light and I ended up hitting her.  The RAV4 ended up being totaled, but I came through the accident with just minor bumps, the airbags literally surrounded me, kept me from harm.  No question but to replace it with a new 2017 RAV4."
"01  4, 2020",2017 Toyota Rav4,Very affordable and reliable compact SUV.  Good on Gas Mileage and the AWD works well in bad weather.  The seats are comfortable and all controls are easily accessible.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a compact SUV
"01  3, 2020",A perfect fit for our families needs.,"The Rav4 has lots of power, great features and is fun to drive.  The silver and black combination is eye catching. Im tall and there is plenty of leg room for all.  Overall, the Rav4 is a perfect fit."
"01  2, 2020",Great vehicle for my needs!,"Excellent vehicle so far.  Love the comfort and styling, and performance.  For an SUV, the gas mileage is pretty good and it has more room than meets the eye."
"01  2, 2020",Love this car,This was a gift for my son and he loves it.  He says it drives so smooth and he love the safety features it has.
"12 28, 2019",6th RAV4 I've owned,"This is the 4th new RAV4 I've bought, have 2 other 05 models I use for work. All have been excellent vehicles. This RAV4 has been as dependable as all the others.  Wife is wanting a new 2020."
"12 16, 2019","Very reliable vehicle, used as a second vehicle on","Vehicle perfect, for any family new and old , additional warranty, forward to the buyer, was purchased @ Toyota. This vehicle also has heated leather seats"
"12  6, 2019",It’s a blast to drive!,Love all the safety features! The Rav is sporty and functional.  It’s fun to drive and it looks good doing it. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone
"12  2, 2019",This is one of the best cars for the money,"This RAV4 is very stylish and affordable. I love that it gets a combined 28 mpg. After 3 years, all I've done is oil changes and a new set of tires.  Brakes still have 9mm of wear. This car does well in the snow as it is AWD. I gave this car to my daughter and I'll be buying a 2019 RAV4 this week."
"11 28, 2019",Reliable SUV,"This car provided me excellent experience. I drove it couple years for my job where s a mile away from my home and travels with my family. It has usb ports,aux,bluetooth options to connect and enjoy my trips. It s reliable and good budget car as SUV."
"11 19, 2019",Great car,Meets all of our needs and was very affordable.  Surprising legroom in the back.  Smooth ride.  We'd be happy to go back and buy another but hopefully that won't be for many years.
"11 18, 2019",Really loose,"While this car is reliable, Sophisticated the steering seems very sensitive and loose. If you go over a bump expect to feel as if your in a Jeep. You flop around and about like a fish out of water, as a passenger.  As far as comfort, kick back and recline in the back seat. Safety wise, I feel safe. You feel like your driving a truck, and as if there’s so much space between you and your surroundings. But, the placement of the middle back seat buckle is a little awkward. It hurts bottoms. Overall, B+ in my book. I would recommend it."
"11 14, 2019",1st new car in years!,"I've only had this vehicle a couple days but I'm glad I chose it and was able to work the numbers to get it.  It is my first new car (well, new to me, it's a used, 2017 model) in almost 12 years.  It has a lot more room than my previous car and the ""standard"" items are a huge step up from the basic, bare minimum, things I had on that car.  I love the color, the safety features and it drives very well.  My last car was a Toyota and it lasted a long time, 190,000 + miles, until a deer totaled it.  I'm hoping this Rav4 does just as well for me!"
"11 12, 2019",GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY,"Test drove the Nissan Rogue and Honda CRV, felt Toyota RAV4 was the best value of all. The Rogue was less in price, but it was very noisy from the engine and trans compartment. The ride was not sturdy or firm, but I liked the remote start only. CRV higher in price, comparable
to the RAV4, but why pay more !"
"11  8, 2019",Comfortable,I would say this Is a good reliable car. It has good features and very spacious for a family of five.  The cargo space is also big enough. I like the overall look of it.
"11  8, 2019",Raving over my Rav4!,"This vehicle is all that I was looking for. It is roomy but not huge, does great on gas mileage, and it performs beautifully.  It is a very peppy vehicle, handles great, all systems work as they should, and it is the first vehicle I had bluetooth in, and I'm loving that.  It is also the color combination I was looking for, with a sun roof, so, it is very pleasing to the eye.  I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I'm looking forward to many years of driving it!"
"10 29, 2019",This 2017 has Torgue converter issues,"After dealing with the worst Toyota dealership I’ve ever had to deal with. We also received no assistance from Toyota Canada. Our RAV4 has too many issues to mention but the biggest issue is the Torgue converter failing at just over 100,00 kms. We will never purchase another Toyota product. Garage!!"
"10 16, 2019",Only owned for 2 weeks,Never drove an SUV  before.  I took it for a test drive and fell in love.  This is my 3rd Toyota.  It has a lot of bells and whistles.  Don't miss the power seat.  I set it and it stays.  It has some pep and the gas mileage is o.k.  I do mostly city.  Lots of stops and go.    My car insurance went down!    I hope my relationship with this beauty lasts for a long time. I did buy an aftermarket cover for the cargo area.  I like hiding stuff from prying eyes.  It doesn't have back seat vents which seems odd to me.
"10 16, 2019",New owner,"I have just made the purchase. So far, I love how it handles and rides.
It is averaging good on gas mileage. I love the room for cargo and of the size of the vehicle  itself- as far as parking."
"10  7, 2019",Es uno de los mejores autos que he tenido,"Este es un gran auto es confortable y espacioso. Puedo hacer viajes en familia y se tiene mucha comodidad, aparte de que viajamos de forma muy segura. Es un auto excelente."
"09 29, 2019",Most reliable car I have owned.,"This car met all what I needed. It’s not expensive for a Toyota ,the room is very good and it’s economy, safety and comfort ."
"09 22, 2019",Brakes are junk,Comfortable but no powerful. Exterior style is beautiful. Brakes are garbage and the dealer do not take ownership on the problem. I would not buy a Toyota anymore.
"08 31, 2019",Best car ever!,"This car is beautiful and reliable.  The safety features are top-notch.  Though the size is on the smaller size, it feels like a huge luxurious SUV.  There is plenty of space for people, pets, and luggage.  The style is the best on the road."
"08 17, 2019",The most reliable car I own,The best car I ever owned so far. Fuel efficient. Sleek and sporty. Very reliable. It looks executive. Maintenance wise you will save some money.
"08  1, 2019",Great Toyota,Great vehicle with great reliability. Love Toyota and love my RAV4. Drives great with lots of pep. Nathan Bright was a pleasure to work with.
"07 30, 2019",Love my SUV,Best car I have owned in years. I especially love the sunroof. My sister had a Ford Escape and wants my car. I feel I got good value for the money.
"07 28, 2019","Great SUV. Reliable, comfortable, and Stylish","Toyota is the best brand I've ever owned. Always up on safety Features , style, and reliability.  Easy maintenance and comfortable ride. Saves on fuel also."
"07  8, 2019",Smooth riding,Car is much smoother riding that my previous car.  Also has all the bells and whistles. Have not owned it long enough to provide further information.
"06 24, 2019",Bad transmisión on  my rav4 2017,"I got this rav4 2017 brand new and just after the toyota waranty got expired the transmisión break down now i have to pay.Out of my packet about $5,000 ,to repair it"
"05 26, 2019",Beautiful vehicle!,"I have never had an SUV and only have had a few days but drives smoothly, lots of room, beautiful inside and out! I would recommend this vehicle!"
"05 10, 2019",Keep me going,"I was surprised at the gas mileage I get on the highway! At times 30 plus miles to the gallon. It has pickup when I need it too. I added a trailer hitch because it is needed at times. Car pulls a trailer fine! Seats are very comfortable. I like the dashboard arrangement of the 2015 Rav4 that my wife has than the arrangement of the 2017 model. Downside, turning on a street at night. The headlights do not illuminate the area that I am turning into very well. Love the radar, works very well on the highway."
"04 27, 2019",Review RAV4 2017,"This car suits all my needs! Drive is responsive with multiple mode of drives like economic, sports and regular! I am satisfied with its safety alert system like in-lane warning, emergency active accident deterrent alert, and so on!  I have a few recommendations:
1. I hit my head a few times when I got in the driver seat because the roof is low and it hurts my neck,
2. The interior noise from engine could be hurt while accelerating, sound proof needs improved
3. The extra small side view attachment mirror is too small and far from the main side view mirror, making difficulty to view , could it be a side camera instead to detect and alert the traffic at the blind angle?"
"04 21, 2019",My first car,This car is going to be a start for my future. It’s helping me establish credit and it’s also helping me get to new places.
"04  6, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned,"What's not to say that's great about this car. It has The back-up camera, Bluetooth connection to my phone, USB ports and auxiliary port, stylish, was told it's a sexier vehicle, more reliable since it's a Toyota, excited to go on new adventures in this gas efficient vehicle. It will take a little while to get used to not being able to see the end of my hood so that I know where the bumpers are. Spacious inside, even though it's a Toyota."
"04  4, 2019",Horrible gas mileage,"I purchased a new RAV4 because I have owned seven other Toyotas and have been Very very happy but I am extremely disappointed in the performance of this particular RAV4. My average gas mileage is 17 to 18 miles per gallon which is unacceptable and I would’ve never purchased the vehicle having known it’s poor mileage. I have dealt with Toyota customer service and have not been able to resolve this issue and five other Problematic issues i.e. starter, suspension, computer glitches. Since it has no navigation system it will not connect with my new IPhone 10.  This RAV4 XLE has the worst blind spot on any vehicle I have ever driven. Tailgate is manual and so it is high and heavy when it is opened and I can hardly get the trunk shut. I expected more from this SUV. Everything else I like  . It is a roomy small SUV. Has good tires and traction. I have an AWD. It will alarm me if I start to cross either side of the lane I am driving in. It alerts me sometimes and helps me to stop if a vehicle in front of me stops quickly, keeping me from having an accident.  But still can’t trust it.  has windshield wipers on back window with washer fluid. Has spoiler and built in splash guards, also am/FM radio and CD player. Good sound system. Gas mileage is horrible at 17 city to 21 highway. Easy for children to get in back seat. Plenary of leg room. Lots of plugins for cell phone and iPad. In fry and back.  Nice cargo net and plenty of room in the trunk.
It’s a good size for a compact suv
There's not a lot of useful storage space in the driver's area. It's pretty roomy in the back for a compact vehicle but wish we could fit 3 car seats across. Also the middle seat belt isn't very usable with the placing of the belt, we basically lose that middle seat. Great for one car seat only."
"03 29, 2019",I like it,"2017 Rav4 limited Nice ride and in comfort Too all the bells and whistles
very pleased  I have owned four Toyotas  this one having the most options"
"03 24, 2019","super good, reliable","The car net all my needs.it is spacious, it isnt too big, it is  gas saver for it's capacity. in the winter I can start it from around the corner with the remote starter."
"03 21, 2019",Replaced a 14 year old Camry,Handles great!  Nice quiet ride. Getting used to the features. Enjoying the maneuverability. It is easy to get in and out of. Easy to park.
"02 24, 2019",Comfortable and stylish,This is my first Toyota and I am very pleased with the design and overall performance. I had a sedan and was not comfortable. I like the extra room and the ability to drop the back seats for storage or shopping or traveling.
"02 12, 2019","Wow, what an upgrade.","I drove a 2004 5-speed Nissan Xterra SE.  Manual everything, this RAV4 is smarter than I am before you even turn the key.
I am pleased with the price, the quality of the vehicle, and the establishment I bought from.
I had combed the net for what I had to choose from with my budget and my wants.  I was all set to test drive everything and then decide.  Honestly, my first test drive hit all my needs and most of my wants within reason.
I asked myself, why wait.  I know what I want.  So I didn't and I couldn't be happier."
"02 12, 2019",Really Fun Car,My first vehicle not a work truck. Rav 4 is great. Just a few wish list items. I wish it had vents in the back seat. The car has good acceleration but it would be nice to have a more powerful engine. Would also like a small side compartment in the back to put  things in. Like a gallon of milk.  Looking forward to many adventures in the AWD car. Handles very nice and good visibility. Looks much better with black rims.
"02 11, 2019",love our Rav 4,This is a great car and so fun to drive.  Great gas mileage  and quiet on the road    Far exceeds what I was expecting from the Rav 4.   Good stereo system too.
"02  7, 2019",Nice reliable/great mileage,"Jus want to say, I was looking for a 6 cylinder and the Toyota dealer had me drive the Toyota Rav-4 4cylinder. Very impressed with the get up and go...I will have owned the vehicle for 2 years at end of February, and all ready have 30k miles on it. Love everything, shape, size, get up and go, gas mileage, really moves around corners and such and fast smooth ride, only wish I would have upgraded to the Sirius and Maps...and the place I went to took our rv for trade in....But do have question, Was getting my 30k oil changed and driving home, I heard this bank and looked in side mirror and myrubber strip that goes under the luggage rack was dangling....Called where I just came from and they said it is glued/sticky on....Any one else have that problem???"
"02  7, 2019",Rav 4 fits our needs!,"The rav 4 carries my husband's wheelchair. I am (68 yrs old) able to pack the car for a trip, close the hatch, roll the electric wheelchair up the little flip down attatched shelf thing, fasten the straps, and get that all held down. My husband can get in and out of either front or back seat unaided. The height of the seat, and door opening are just right.  The seat adjustmenting system works well. We are both comfortable for longer rides. I like the blue tooth, radio, and silly things like the outside temperature. The light coming on to remind me of low fuel is nice."
"02  3, 2019","Best Car I've Ever Owned, EVER!","This may read like another typical review of this vehicle, but the hype is real with this car! It really is perfect for anyone who likes driving SUVs or needs an AWD car. It's super reliable and dependable, has a really comfortable interior, plenty of cargo space, a TON of cool accessories, great gas mileage, and on top of that the exterior looks amazing without looking too flashy. The only con is the acceleration could be a bit better on the highway. It's not impressive when it comes to acceleration but it doesn't struggle to accelerate either. Other than that you get what you pay for with this vehicle!"
"01 31, 2019",A great car.,"I love this car! 
It has a lot of room for my family to sit comfortably.
The only thing I wish I had was more USB hook ups."
"01 22, 2019",Unbeatable price,Mr Cars made me feel great about making a purchase on a Rav 4 . Joe was considerate and respectful of my needs in this car. The price was unbeatable!!! He did an amazing job to find the perfect car for me. I just signed and walked out of there with a smile. I will definitely do business with them again and I highly recommend that you visit this place before making your purchase!
"01 11, 2019",comfortable ride,"I have it for only 2 months,but its nice to drive.Lots of room inside,quiet and smooth ride.One con is no speed control for intermite wipers,one speed only.Nice looking interior. I hear that toyota is reliable,will find out. Checked mpg,22 around town ,27 trip"
"12 28, 2018","A strong, heavy, very safe feeling car","This is the car I been wanting for awhile now.  AWD, so it will be good in New England during the winter.  It has more leg room front and back than much more expensive SUV's"
"12 23, 2018",I owned my last car for 23 years,"This RAV 4 is significantly different than my 23 year old Suburban, but I am in a different stage of my life and I was happy to scale down. I like the power of this vehicle and appreciate the quiet, both in its ride and the ability to screen outside noise.  I think this a perfect match for me!"
"12 20, 2018",2017 RAV4 Limited,"Excellent small SUV for the money & so fun to drive! The interior is roomy with good legroom. Even though it’s a 4 cylinder, it has good acceleration and is quite peppy!"
"12  7, 2018",my 2001 Toyota highlander,It served us well 204000 and little repairs would have kept it but felt it was time to get something new happy with Toyota even for future consideration
"12  5, 2018","Overall a nice vehicle, good bargain","We enjoy our RAV4.  It  has  all the latest technology, is safe and reliable and a pleasure to drive.  The passenger seat is a bit uncomfortable after an hour bug that is the only negative to the vehicle"
"12  5, 2018",Great SUV,We have enjoyed the Rav4.  It is the first SUV for us and we like ?sitting high? compared to our sedan.  It has good pick-up and good gas mileage.
"11 30, 2018","fun to drive, carries lots of stuff...","can go anywhere, camping, traveling, reliable and comfortable....good visibility and quick!  back seats are easy to put up and down, really comfortable  for those in the back.   Lots of bells and whistles !"
"11 27, 2018",Should be the TOP FIVE in each class/group.,This should be the standard -bearer vehicle amongst its group. It's dependable and reliable car for your daily use. The safety features are excellent. You get your monies worth.
"10 21, 2018",LOVE this vehicle!!,"LOVE everything about this car. Compared to my Mazda and Honda similar sized SUVs, this is the absolute BEST!!  Love the ?blind spot? notice on the outside  rear view mirror and the beeps when something is in front/ behind me. I will be a Toyota gal for life!!!!"
"10 13, 2018",Love my car,"This car is amazing. Plenty of room, comfortable, great features and upgrades. The car rides smoothly and no maintenance problems. My only hiccup is gas mileage has steadily decreased over the past year, which never happened with my Camry previously."
"10  3, 2018",Just Purchased!,I traded up from a small hatchback and I love the room and the way it handles! Lots of cargo space and extra features like lane alerts and automatic slowing in traffic!
"09 12, 2018",Very reliable and comfortable.,"The car is comfortable, handles well and is very reliable. Visually very appealing and roomy inside. Lots of trunk space for carrying things and very easy access."
"08 24, 2018",Good option for everyday driving.,"I like that Toyota provides maintenance included with the purchase.  It is a comfortable interior and good size.  I'm used to 6 cylinder cars so it took a little getting used to since it doesn't have a lot of kick to it, just good for everyday driving to and from work."
"08 14, 2018",One of the best SUVs I've ever owned.,Love the style. Handles the road awesome. Great in the snow and weather. very reliable.  Love the style and the interior. The driver seat could be a little more comfortable.
"07 27, 2018",Great Mileage and Safety,I downsized from a Highlander to the RAV4. I do a ton of driving so the better gas mileage is a plus. I love the advanced features like predictive cruise control and stay in the lane guidance. It makes me feel better when my young adult kids drive the car.  It has taken some time to adjust to the smaller interior. It is quite smaller than the Highlander. I do love the Hybrid quietness and great gas mileage.
"07 24, 2018",Amazing vehicle drives like a dream,Love my RAV4 second one I lease.  Love  all the bells and whistles. The interior is perfect  for any family. Everyone fits comfortably and plenty of leg room.  Can't say it enough I LOVE MY RAV4
"07 24, 2018",My second one,"Rides smooth, with no exterior noise.  There is plenty of space inside and has wonderful interior features. Great air conditioning. This car has been extremely dependable."
"07 19, 2018",Super delicate paint and not much pick up and go.,"This car has lots of room but even in sport mode doesn't accelerate that well.  It's reasonably comfortable but the paint chips or scratches if you even look at it sideways (not really, but seriously, it resists NOTHING).  My previous Toyotas both had more durable paint."
"07  9, 2018",Love my Rav4 second one and love it too!,Comfortable and flexible for transporting kids to college.  Very reliable and good on gas.  Love the small feel but roomy .  Rides well in the winter.
"07  4, 2018",Great buy!,The car is exactly what I was looking for. Great price for the value of the vehicle. It was accurately portrayed on the website. I could not be happier.
"07  2, 2018",good suv,"thus far I have enjoyed this car ,  and has met my expectations for a small SUV. I expect to keep this vehicle for a minimum of  10 years"
"07  1, 2018","Very reliable, nice to drive","I really like this car, handles well with decent .gas mileage. This is my second Rav 4 and I am pleased. Will probably get another in a few years."
"06 27, 2018",Great for small SUV,Car seats comfortably 5. Drives very well. Driver assist function is fantastic. Cruise is a little hard to get used to. The GPS and voice recognition is not as efficient as the one we had in our Prius.
"06 27, 2018",Best Buy For Your Money,"Great SUV comfortable and roomy yet stylish, fold down rear seats excellent for a family or just someone who needs a lot of room and comfort."
"06 26, 2018",Wonderful car!,"I bought this car two weeks ago. I adore it so far! Decent gas mileage for an SUV, smooth ride, wonderful handling, and great features!"
"06 24, 2018",reliable,To early to tell but love it so far. Still learning all the new gadgets never had before. Ride is smooth and comfortable. It comes highly reommended.
"06 22, 2018",The best vehicle I have ever owned!,"I was impressed with all the safety features in this car, and it drives beautifully in snow. I love the cameras and use them backing up, makes things easier for me. I?ve had my car just over a year, love, love, love it!"
"06 22, 2018","Don't buy, unsafe headlights","I bought my 2017 RAV 4 brand new last summer. I LOVED it until I drove it at night a few months ago. The headlights do not adequately illuminate the road in front of you. I live in a rural area and there are no street lights and lots of twisting roads with vegetation and deer hiding. The headlights do not allow you to see 200' feet in front of you. On ""auto"" brights there is a bit of delay so that is not ideal either. 

Recently, I took the RAV4 in for scheduled maintenance and asked the service technician to check the lights out. He informed me that they are working as they are designed and that MANY customers complain about this. He did say other car manufacturers have the same problem. Lesson learned. Get rid of RAV4 because it is not safe to drive at night and test drive replacement vehicle at night. Truly never expected to feel unsafe in my car because of headlights!"
"06 21, 2018",We love the car!,"It's a nice size for me. My husband also loves the car. He is 6'3"" and a big guy. It is very comfortable for him too. It gets good gas mileage and we are very happy with the car."
"06  6, 2018",Greatest all-around SUV,"I am on my 6th one and strongly recommended it for Anybody, family or individual,plenty of room,plenty of comfort, plenty of everything. I've tried many of SUVs but this one tops them all."
"06  3, 2018",sluggish,"I took it for a test drive last year, with two of us and the salesman in the car. It seemed sluggish, on a straight, long, even road. My 2014 Kia Soul (reviewed here) was much more peppier, even with two overweight passengers. Car is attractive, salesman offered me a too good to be true deal on it. I passed. Buy the Soul, THAT's a good value."
"05 30, 2018","My ""Stella"" is Stylin' & Profilin'!","Yes, Stella is her name and I ABSOLUTELY Love Love Love my RAV4!  Toyota Rav4 is one of the safest SUVs on the road!  It also has great leg room and is comfortable on short drives or on the highway.  Good gas mileage, but have I have mostly in town driving.  Drives great and has great pick up and go even in ECO mode!"
"05 27, 2018",Have owned 2 Rav 4's. Love the ride and feel.,We love the ride and feel of stability. Handles the road excellent in our winter conditions. Comfortable back seats and plenty of leg room. My only issue was the side mirrors cause a major blindspot trying to take corners or seeing curbs when making a turn compared to the mirrors on older model Rav 4.
"05 25, 2018",Best car on lot and i got it,This car was the one i wanted  i love the color  its very roomy. Great to do my job with.  Had great low mileage and was very clean.
"05 14, 2018",They just continue to make the RAV4 great!,"Comfortable, roomy, handles very well, has wonderful safety features that are SO helpful . 
If someone is tall or needing leg room, you'd be very comfortable in this one.
Fantastic Sound system."
"05 13, 2018",Sweet Ride,This Rav4 is in like new condition. I was looking for a Rav4 in this color and in this year. Cars.com sent me to a dealer in my area that had exactly what I was looking for. I might not have gone to this dealership if not for cars.com and I would not have this wonderful car to drive.
"05 10, 2018",Completely happy!,This vehicle was a replacement for one that I owned for the last 12 years. I was a bit concerned that the much smaller engine would leave me wishing for the power of the big V8 of the older vehicle but the 4 cylinder in the Rav4  has proved to be more than adequate. I am very pleased with the safety features that come standard with the Toyota and the gas consumption is exceptionally good.
"05 10, 2018",Super cool,We were not sure what SUV we were looking for. We had seen several Rav4 models And also looked at a Ford Escape and A few others. We were blessed to find a RAV4 with lots of extras on it that we were not hoping for. We are very pleased
"05  4, 2018",Good vehicle for price,It was good for deal and very comfortable. The sensors are accurate. Good sound system and is fuel efficient for an SUV. . . .
"05  1, 2018",Excellent!,Owned 2015 RAV4 and shopped around and still went and got 2017 RAV4 same one ) just love Toyota! All services are excellent and vehicle is oustanding!
"04 26, 2018",Love my car,"It's sporty, fun to drive, has lots of room for me and my passengers as well as cargo space. It's gets good gas mileage. The only maintenance I've had to get was the oil changes."
"04 24, 2018","The best made car ever, I am a Toyota girl.","Toyota RAV4 is the best vehicle I have ever owned. This is my third one, my last one was 13 years old before training in for a 2017. I am a Toyota person."
"04 21, 2018","Great car, duper mileage and comfort","Great car, for small suv plenty of room, good mileage. Plenty of power. Definetly a quality automobile, with a lot of nice options. Love the radar cruise, does great around town and on long trips."
"04 16, 2018",Save gas,Save gas. AWD. 4syl. Really funny if you look not front it gives you alarm some one front of you. Safe accident. And controls AWD CAMIRA breaks
"04 16, 2018",Very good save gas,Save gas AWD not need anything really funny give you alarm if you?re looking not front when other car close to you. Safe of accident.
"04 14, 2018",Toyota Rav4,I just love this car it is so comfortable and easy to drive! It has so much room in it . I like how there is a button to open the back. So easy!
"04  9, 2018",Toyota RAV4 2017,This car meets our family needs. Is is spacious for our family of three and we will be able to grow as a family with it.
"04  7, 2018",Will Always Choose Another Rav4,This was the fourth Rav 4 we purchased and we will always go back to a Rav 4.  Our previous one kept us safe in a near head-on crash and the new safety features are AWESOME!
"04  4, 2018",Overpriced,Had it for a month .Overpriced average car.Not economical on fuel .Very sensitive on the holes on the roads in Chicago .Not a good value for money.
"04  3, 2018",Holds the road well,I like it for the most part except for the rear hatch. Suggest opening like a door. Or auto open from inside.... Too hard to open
"04  2, 2018",Very reliable car,This car met all my needs. Very good for a family. Very reliable and comfortable with a lot of space inside. Trunk is spacious. Passengers are happy with this car.
"04  2, 2018",Great in snow!! Roomy,"More than met my expectations. Good value, roomy, stylish, great safety options. I would buy another in a heartbeat and am considering buying one for hubby as well down the line."
"03 29, 2018",One of the best. Cars l?ve ever owned,This car meets all of my needs. It has plenty of leg room in the front and back. I love all of the hi- tech features.
"03 26, 2018","Love Toyota, my rav is amazing","It's sporty, reliable and comfortable for traveling as well as everyday use. Recommend Toyota to all my family and friends. Love all the features that are equipped in my rav4. The color is bright and cheery."
"03 25, 2018",LOVE MY RV4 TOYOTA,"This car is perfect for me and family, economic and modern, beautiful midnight blue color, super comfortable and spacious for traveling long distances.  i think have a great value for the money i payed"
"03 25, 2018",Great Car!,"This is my second Rav 4. Love it! The only thing I have an issue with is that the rotors start warping at about 14,000 miles (in both 2015 and 2017 Rav's I've purchased)... My understanding is that Toyota is aware of this but they haven't guaranteed to fix. Other than this, it's the best car."
"03 23, 2018",Great Car and great size,The RAV4 is a reliable well appointed inside and out.  Great Value and very comfortable to drive and sit in.  The size is excellent for many uses for pleasure and for picking up items.
"03 22, 2018",Good car,"The RAV4 is roomy and comfortable! I wish Toyota would make it with leather seats and more interior color choices. The car doesn't take off as quickly as i would like, but I was used to driving a Toyota Solara SLE and it was a small car with a V6 engine."
"03 20, 2018",Beautiful style. Beautiful ride.,"Great mileage in the ECO mode. Easy to handle, love the safety features! Comfortable and a truly beautiful SUV! The stereo system is exceptional and can be controlled from the steering wheel."
"03 16, 2018",Great buy!,First time with an SUV and like it. This SUV is smooth and handles very well. It comes with many safety features and the only one I would enhance is the reaction time when the SUV sense you are derailing. Other than that it is perfect.
"03 14, 2018","So far, so good:  12 month review","This 2017 RAV4 base model in silver is a fantastic value for its quality.  We purchased this once our 13 year old minivan became too expensive to repair, and too large for our family's needs.  We have driven this on several hundred mile road trips, and also use it as my wife's primary vehicle.  Average highway mpg is around 27, and 22 in the city.  It's a comfy ride in both settings, and has a deceptively large interior once you get in.  I'm 6'2"" and could sit comfortably in the back if necessary.  Cargo room is ample, and my kids like the reclining rear seats for longer drives.  If I were to recommend changes, it would be to add a hook or mechanism that secures the passenger side floor mat just like the driver's side has, and simplify the touch screen.  There just seems to be a lot going on in a little space- though I'll admit I'm not sure how to do that.  Overall, love the car, we'd buy again, and we'd buy from Jerry's Toyota.  Their regularly scheduled service has been excellent."
"03 12, 2018",Second one I have owned never had a problem.I,I owned a 2015 never had a problem.Purchased 2017 6 month ago partly  because of all the safety  features that  are  standard on Toyota  vehicles.I feel they make their vehicles a better value love them all.No problems.
"03 10, 2018",Awesome Vehicle,I have had many cars over the years and this model is the best of the lot. It handles on the road superbly and the torque under the hood is second to none...I am a musician and needed a reliable vehicle that I can haul my gear in. I literally purchased this model brand new and it is simply a great car.
"03  4, 2018",Sharp SUV,Enough room for me to feel comfortable . Price was pretty good.  Bringing back wife to see if she likes it. Carolyn Fritz was very helpful . She found exactly what I wanted.
"03  2, 2018",Love it.,"After doing a lot of research and many test drives, I bought the RAV4, used, with 9,000 miles.   I love all of the features.  It's nice looking, handles well,  very smooth drive."
"03  1, 2018",Great car,"Reliable and comfortable. Excellent dual heat and cold system. melting windshield wipers feature is great. heated seata are great. the windshield fluid container is great, it hold a full jug of wiper fluid, and so we don't constantly run out like we did in our old car. placement of the spare tire is terrible. our old Rav4 had the tire on the outside, not in the trunk. when you have the entire back of your SUV full or luggage and Christmas gifts and everything else, and you are driving in a mountain pass, when you get a flat tire you have to empty the whole car to get the tire. then the tire is not a real tire, it is a basic cheap tire.  When you get a new tire, you can't put the old one back into in the spare area because it is only big enough to fit the cheap spare tire.  overall great car"
"02 22, 2018",Awesome car to own,Ever reliable Toyota produced another gem. Nice car to own. Will never land you in trouble. Drive is comfortable amenities are good and you feel awesome in high speed
"02 17, 2018",Great car,"Reliable, smooth engine , spacious , safe on snow and bad weather , holds its resale value ,I recommend this car to anyone in the market for a stylish affordable reliable vehicle that need AWD capabilities"
"02 17, 2018",Great car with excellent safety features,Met all of our needs. Very comfortable and has so many bells and whistles. This car gets very good gas mileage and travels well on highway.
"02 16, 2018",Nice small SUV,This car meets all of my needs.  Great and comfortable road performance.  Has all the interior amenities I need.  More interior space than previous RAV4.
"02 16, 2018",Very nice and gets very good gas milesge,"Really like it runs, drives, and rides good. Has a lot of room for a small suv. For the price of the RAV4 is Avery good value"
"02 10, 2018",Very Disappointing,"Do not buy.  Not the same quality as past Toyotas I have owned.  Too much road noise to enjoy the audio system.   And Audio system has software flaws that Toyota does not seem to care about fixing.  When playing music in song name sequence  from a USB drive, the music randomly  jumps forward skipping several songs at a time.  Dealer acknowledges problem but does not expect a fix.  Also, the audio system even finds songs previously deleted from the USB drive, so you can never add a song to the USB drive and then remove it without reformatting the drive and adding only the songs you want to hear.  Front seating is very uncomfortable for both tall and short passengers.   Not having a motorized front passenger seat on the Platinum model is such a disappointment.  If this is representative of current Toyota attitudes to vehicle quality, this will be my last toyota."
"02  5, 2018",love this car,"love the look and the drive! This car is very comfortable and reliable. I hate driving in the snow, but driving in this i am very confident and relaxed."
"01 31, 2018",Nice looking vehicle,"The RAV4 is a quality vehicle for the money.  It not only looks good  with its sleek styling, but is very economical with excellent gas mileage.  The interior has very comfortable seats and a lot of leg room for the rear seat passengers.  The duel climate control makes the air temperature comfortable for both driver and passenger.  The cargo area has a tremendous amount of space; even enough to get everything in your child going to college might need."
"01 24, 2018",Very good auto with flaws,"Negatives: poor infotainment system,  poor, tinny, speakers.
                  Ride can be busy,especially over sharp bumps.
                  headroom on passenger-side door can  be an
                   issue.

Positives:   Reliable, good quality product, advanced safety
                   devices, standard across the product line."
"01 23, 2018",2017 Toyota Tacoma  access cab,"As far as I'm concerned I've been buying this type of vehicle every 2 to 3 years since 1989 and I have never come across any problems. This 2017 Tacoma feels like it has more muscle and is a pleasure to drive as of this date I have only put on 6000 miles (January 22, 2018). I have put it through its paces in snow and a little off road driving and it is just as good as as if I was driving on an interstate road. I am a falconer and I drive plenty of back roads to places where I hunt my birds. I really don't know what else to say except I'm happy with my purchase."
"01 20, 2018",Excited to buy this car,"Meets all of my needs, fun to drive and handles well.  Looking forward to driving this car for many years"
"01 17, 2018",nice design and very reliable,"i really enjoy this car, also love new face lifted design.  it is only 4 cylinders but powerful enough in the Colorado mountains."
"01 10, 2018",So far excellent.  This is my third Toyota...love,The height is one main reason I purchased this model.  Also love the head room.  Solid car and excellent visibility!
"01 10, 2018",Like new / comfortable ride!,"This car fits my current needs.  I am 69 and was looking for a vehicle that was easier to get in and out of.  I asked our trusted mechanic for recommendations, then test drove the two top choices he suggested.  This one was just right.  It has lane change warning and blind spot warning, plus heated seats!  Loving it!"
"01  1, 2018",AWESOME RAV4,"I love the RAV4 it gives me everything I wanted in a SUV, it has sufficient power and I love the Eco mode and often find myself purposely trying to save gas, granted this is no race car but it does quite well in passing on the highway.  The SUV also is quite comfortable on long trips and love the audio system since I can load my own playlist................."
"12 30, 2017",Amazing!,"34 MPG Need we say more? Pick up like a V6
Comfortable and looks great!
Love those heated seats!
Great buying experience!"
"12 27, 2017",The best car I?ve ever owned!,This car is so comfortable with heated seats on those cold mornings! I love the beautiful sleek style of interior! I just love it! So easy to drive!
"12 27, 2017",Love our RAV4,"We love it.  Fun to drive, roomy enough for 4 with luggage, great gas mileage, zippy in traffic, did climb well enough in mountains, although a 6-8 cylinder has more power on the steep inclines.  Interior is functional, nice stereo sound, moon roof, safety features like lane assist to prevent drifting, etc.  it had been 14 years since our last new car, so we did a lot of shopping before deciding on the RAV4 and have no regrets.  We love it."
"12 21, 2017",Best Toyota,The 2017 Toyota Rav 4 XLE is the best Toyota I have ever owned! It meets all expectations and with Michelin tires it is the safest car that I have ever owned!
"12 21, 2017",Great vehicle,No complaints.  New styling makes it look much more expensive than it is! Holds it value and super reliable
"12 16, 2017",Best car i have owned,I have tested a lot of cars Chevys  are nice but when you get high miles on them they start falling apart that's why I chose the Toyota built to last
"12 15, 2017",Most reliable vehicle I have owned,"Wow, where do I begin. I absolutely love the adaptive cruise control. No more stepping on brake to slow down for vehicle in front of you and your speed is adjusted to match that of vehicle in front of you. The lane departure system alerts me when I  cross either lane line without the turn signal on.  The emergency braking system for stopped vehicle in my path has saved me a couple of times and ohh, the gas mileage is great also."
"12 14, 2017",One of the better cars I have owned,This car glides on the road. It has plenty of room and some to spare. I am often amazed by how well it handles in good and bad weather.
"12 13, 2017",Handles well driving around town.,Looking forward to driving it in the snow as it handles well in the Bay area but I do not know yet how it will handle up in the mountains.  It looks beautiful and so far Irate it 4.8 out of 5.
"12 12, 2017",Rav4 Toytoa,"I like the performance,handling,& comfort.I got the chance to use all wheel with no issues.Plenty of leg room & back seat room for my dog"
"12  8, 2017",Capable car,"If you're looking for a smaller all wheel drive car, this is comparable to the cr-v, without the CVT transmission, for the old school feel of a car. Plenty of space for carrying cargo, plenty of power, and feedback from the ride."
"12  4, 2017",Smooooth,"Great SUV, interior carpet is not as plush as other Toyota's I have owned, and the plastic on the doors and console are susceptible to scratching, but really is a great ride and value.
Plus, ITS A TOYOTA !!"
"12  1, 2017",Best Car Ever!!!,"This car is amazing! It is very spacious, good on gas, and stylish! Best SUV I?ve owned, hands down!"
"12  1, 2017",Its a good choice!,"This car is comfortable and serves its purpose. The side mirrors don't defrost well and I wish that it had the advanced features some of the older models have (keyless entry, push button start) but these are really vanity features. The gas mileage is good and I have not had any issues driving in all types of weather"
"12  1, 2017",My 4th Toyota I will never stray again,"Comfortable, handles well. This will be my fourth Toyota.  I have owned many cars over my life time and I have never bought a bad Toyota.  A Maxima that nothing but problems that cost a fortune to finally  find and fix.  A 2009 Accord that was top rated for that year had fatal flaws Honda refused to fix but did admit and extended the warranty.  A car should just work, and every Toyota I have ever owned did just that."
"11 28, 2017",Love this car!,"We traded in our Prius (which we loved) for a larger vehicle.  We loved the Prius and thought it was a great car, but needed extra cargo room for our new large breed dog.  The Rav 4 is perfect for us.  It feels more substantial, is solid, quiet and roomy.  And we feel that Toyota is a quality company that stands behind their products."
"11 24, 2017",SMOOTH RIDE,THIS CAR IS PRETTY AWESOME AND COMES WITH GREAT BELLS AND WHISTLES.  THE RIDE IS PRETTY SMOOTH AS WELL.
"11 24, 2017",Dependable RAV4,I love my new RAV4.  I purchased my car a few months ago and am very happy with it.  I love the sport mode that gives me enough power in the mountains.  The optional modes is great on saving gas.
"11 22, 2017",just bought the car 2 days ago,"I love the styling and all the features the car offers.   Getting used to all the new tech that
is included with the car"
"11 22, 2017",Hybrid is the way to go,I am so exited to have the best small SUV on the market and trust me I drove them all. The hybrid is going to give me great gas mileage and the advanced AWD.
"11 17, 2017",Excellently Comfortable Dependable Car I?ve Drove,Besides all the wonderful features of this Toyota RAV4 Platinum my heart & my physical aging body strucks my ATMOST ADMIRATION how the driver seat will get adjusted not only forward & backward BUT ALSO IT GOES UP & DOWN FOR A SHORT PEOPLE LIKE ME with just a touch & PLUS ALSO WITH JUST A SLIGHT SWAY OF YOUR FOOT AT THE BOTTOM PART OF THE CAR IT WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR BECAUSE HANDS ARE FULL OF STUFFS...ANOTHER REALITY HEAVENLY BLESSING !
"11 17, 2017",Pleasure to drive.,"We are in love with this car at first sight. It's XLE trim. Galactic aqua - what an amazing chameleon color! Depending on the lighting the car seems to be either dark blue, or black, or greenish blue with sparks! The ride is smooth and quiet. It has a CD player, so we can use our sizable CD collection.
Even a cassette player can be connected via the AUX port! On longer trips our kids can take naps comfortably in the reclining back seats. The car's safety features are precious! Especially rear cross traffic monitor which warns me when I am backing up from a parking spot and there is a car or even a pedestrian approaching! This is a perfect car for a family."

"11 17, 2017",very comfortable.,"Great car. Everything I need in the interior. Large but speed fast. 
Enough for a family of 4 with lots of extra sport stuff in the roomy cargo area.
100X better than my Ford Escape. I just simply LOVE it!!"
"11 16, 2017",Way better then my Jeep!,Fun to drive - efficient - easy to get my dogs in and out of -  loads of room...comfortable - looks great and I look awesome driving it.
"11 15, 2017",So far so good,"I traded my 2014 BMW X3 for a 2017 Rav 4 since something was always breaking on the BMW.  I was afraid the Rav 4 would feel like a significant downgrade, but it doesn't at all.  The road noise is the same, the handling and breaking doesn't feel extremely different, and so far I really love it.  I have no plans of getting rid of it anytime soon.  I think I'm a new fan of these vehicles!"
"11 13, 2017",The most comfortable car I have ever driven.,"It corresponds to my needs and preferences: safe and smooth ride, confortable seats and attractive exterior."
"11 12, 2017",Sportiest & most elegant SUV I?ve ever owned,I love driving my new RAV4. It is not only easy to handle but very comfortable to drive.  For as long as I can remember I?ve always wanted a RAV4 and this vehicle truly does not disappoint.  I am very pleased with my purchase .
"11 11, 2017",luv my RAV4!!!,"very roomy, visibility is great.  i will still buy another RAV4 in the future.  Mine is 10 years old now and still looks new.  Leg room is great."
"11 10, 2017",Save and confortable .Gave me confidance,"Safety  futures. Gave me sense of security and comfort . Only missing thing is GPS.
I love the space and interior"
"11 10, 2017","This is my second one , I love it !","My wife and I are in our 70s it?s very comfortable with lots of storage space. Very easy to get in and out of , the all wheel drive is really great in the winter, and 4 wheel drive if the going gets tough. We love our Rav 4"
"11 10, 2017",Awesome!,"This car is awesome. It came with a ton of extra features that I? wasn?t expecting. A backup camera, USB ports, tons of storage.  The car is very comfortable and roomy."
"11  6, 2017","Quality, Reliable SUV",We experienced an excellent sales event with Toyota. The 2017 Rav4 Limited AWD is an excellent SUV with style and high reliability. The safety features are great including crash test results.
"11  6, 2017",Loving my new RAV4!,Comfy and has all the bells and whistles I require. Reliable and attractive. Well worth the price I paid.
"11  3, 2017",Reliable and Easy to Drive Car,"After test driving a lot of small cross overs, we eventually decided on the Rav4 since it is easy on the steering with less stress of the neck. The car feels very comfortable and it is definitely value for the money."
"11  2, 2017",Great Car!,"This car has everything I was looking for.  It has a rear view camera and sits high so I can see the road better.  There is more leg room and space for transporting luggage.  The steering wheel has all the controls for radio, phone, etc. which is safer to drive."
"11  1, 2017",Practically drives itself,I?m so impressed how easy the RAV is to drive and how comfortable it is on long trips. I am so glad I chose this vehicle. Seems like I always go back to Toyota. So happy
"11  1, 2017",Very reliable!,"This is my 4th Rav4! I keep buying them, because I never have any problems with them! There's a reason that you see so many on the road!"
"10 31, 2017",Went from Corolla to RAV 4 and I  love it.,"I owned my previous vehicle, a Corolla for 12 years. I can see myself owning this vehicle even longer. It is very comfortable. All the new safety features are very helpful. It rides very comfortable and it has a great views from the front. It has a very open feel."
"10 30, 2017",Love it!,"Red is my favorite color. Performance is excellent, handles great, roomy enough for 5, so happy to have a Toyota again!"
"10 29, 2017",Great Car,"Best seats, cockpit appointments, outstanding handling, everything functions as advertised.  I don't understand why I did not purchase one of these vehicles earlier."
"10 27, 2017","Toyota, Lexus","Great SUV for the money. Save reliable. 
Get the Limited Edition - has a lot of safety features.
Safety - This was critical for us.
We bought this car for our teenage daughter.
Not a good idea to give old car to your kids."
"10 27, 2017",Reliable and comfortable!,Smooth and quiet ride. Roomy and has great safety features! Our family owns 2 RAV 4's and 1 Highlander. Have had great luck with all of our Toyota cars.
"10 26, 2017",Very good SUV,"This is my replacement car after a total loss of previous one due to flood.  Very safe, comfortable, convenient car."
"10 26, 2017",Excellent purchase,So happy with my new RAV4. It has everything I need and want in a vehicle... reliability... style... comfort
"10 26, 2017",Sporty and clean,"This vehicle is sleek, clean, and sporty. It drives very nicely and has outstanding features. A perfect 10!"
"10 25, 2017",Best car I have owned,"This car has exceptional legroom and easy to use technology.  Both of those features are important to me.  Some will say that there is too much plastic in the interior.  My last car was a Toyota Matrix, which is 11 years old now and also has a lot of plastic on the interior, however, my old car still looks new.  I don't mind plastic.  The only down side of my new vehicle, is the seats don't have great lumbar support, and crumbs don't brush off the seats easily or shake out of the all weather mats very well."
"10 25, 2017",Best Car Purchase,When looking to upgrade from a car to an SUV the Rav4 was not initially at the top of my list. I had this picture of the older versions in my head. While at the dealership I browsed the RAV4s and was blown away by the updated styling and size changes. I fell in love after test driving for the weekend. I have the Sport Edition with the Power Package. I love the roomy interior and huge cargo space. It handles beautifully and is very quite. The powerlift gate is very convenient. Toyota did a fantastic job with the Toyota Safety Sense features. No more worrying about being too close to other vehicles while parking/backing up as it alerts to this.
"10 24, 2017",Quaint,"This car doesn?t meet my needs. I was sold this car and the dealer sprung his on me knowing that I didn?t know I didn?t need a leased vehicle.
I previously told Tyler that I put a lot of miles on a vehicle. He knew that I really needed a vehicle because my granddaughter was going to school and I needed a ride. In 3 1/2
Months I have put over 6,000 miles on a vehicle. This is not sufficient for me. I?m appalled that someone would intentionally sell someone something knowing it wouldn?t serve the purpose."
"10 23, 2017",Great little SUV,"Love everything about the SUV.  Think the seats could be a little more comfortable for long trips but other than that, it's great"
"10 23, 2017",Love it so far!,"I have only owned my new, off the lot, 2017 Toyota Rav4 a few days but so far I love it. It is comfortable, stylish inside and out, drives great, and the 2017 has some great bonus safety features. Toyota vehicles are known to ""last forever"" and my husband and I joked that this vehicle may someday be our infant son's first car."
"10 22, 2017",Loved my Rav4  so I purchased a newer one!!,"Love the comfort, performance and reliability of this car!  I do a lot of driving and the design of the seat sort of hugs you and feels very comfortable.  My very tall teenage grandsons sit in the backseat with no problem.  I give it 5 stars all the way around!!"
"10 22, 2017",Best car I've ever purchased! I absolutely love it,"The Rav4 is exactly what I wanted. I know from experience that toyota makes a reliable and stylish automobile.
Extremely happy with my purchase!
Thank you,
Lena"
"10 22, 2017",A superb car,"Very reliable and trustworthy. The AWD feature is great for driving in the winter. One main thing to be aware of is that if one tire needs to be changed, either two or four tires need to be changed."
"10 21, 2017",Fabulous car,"The Rav 4 has so much ""get up and go"" .  I love the interior and all of the many features of this new car.  Drove it back to Missoula in a snow storm and it preformed beautifully."
"10 20, 2017",Good transportation,"Cost effective, good room, good steering, handling. Could be less expensive, better gas mileage, seats uncomfortable. Navigation handy, safety features great!"
"10 20, 2017",Another Great cat from Toyota.,"Very smooth ,reliable car. ,very stylish with lots of cool features. Love the pearl white paint.  .Great fuel mileage and the rims look very high endish."
"10 20, 2017",In love.,"I am so in love with this car, I love driving it, very spacious and comfortable,  and it  rides smooth, I feel on the clouds when I drive it."
"10 19, 2017",Everything I hoped for,"Perfect car for my needs. Economical and plenty of room for my gear. Safety features are a nice touch, and the technology is nice."
"10 19, 2017",Great car,Easy to drive and park with the rear view camera screen plus the blind spot function for the safety of changing lanes.
"10 19, 2017",Great vehicle.,"Not overly exciting to drive, but had I wanted exciting I would have purchased a 86.Rav4 drives and rides well.Plenty of cabin room.Does what it is designed to do."
"10 18, 2017","Great, but downright ugly","Great value for the money.  The radar cruise with automatic braking is fantastic.  Not sure who likes the looks of this car, I sure don't, but the rest of its positive attributes more than make up for its ugliness."
"10 17, 2017",I am impressed with the ride and comfort.,This car has met all my needs to date. It is comfortable and I love the safety features. It has a great turning base I have tight parking in my garage and it is extremely easy and precise.
"10 15, 2017",Feature rich for the money i paid,Car exceeded my expectations. Some of the safety features are outstanding. I am really enjoying the ride.
"10 15, 2017",My first RAV4,"So far, loving it! Purchased it in Oregon and drove it home to Nor. Cal. Comfy with just the right amount of bells and whistles."
"10 15, 2017",2017 Rav4 Limited,"Very sleek ,love the option of programming the drivers seat to fit myself and press button #2 for husband.beautiful car"
"10 13, 2017",A vehicle worth the money.,This vehicle is all that it is advertised to be. The ride and handling is excellent for its size. The interior compartment provides plenty of room for all passengers that it can carry. The cargo capability is more than adequate. Interior controls are easy to use and user friendly. Gas mileage and engine performance are excellent .
"10 11, 2017",Love My New Car,"Love my new car it is so comfortable it does everything more than I planned 
 Absolutely would recommend this vehicle
 Has everything a car needs including More"
"10 11, 2017",Big bang for my bucks,Meets all my needs and the fact that is brand new i love it especially driven so many miles here in Dallas.
"10 10, 2017",Toyota: Ranked Number one by DS RIMCO,"I must say that this is one fine engineered vehicle. Toyota put the S in safety on this RAV 4. The styling , handling and wonderful options will make anyone extremely satisfied."
"10 10, 2017",Very comfortable and a joy to drive,we needed something bigger than our corolla and this was a perfect match.the new technologies are great and we really like the back up camera.
"10 10, 2017",Best car We have ever had.,"This car was higher and wider than our Corolla which we wanted plus ""WHAT A SMOOTH RIDE"" and we love the new technologies especially the rear view camera."
"10  9, 2017",Wonderful!,"Love It! Its economical, looks great and the features are so awesome i can't wait to drive it each time!"
"10  8, 2017",Awesome vehicle!,"I love it! I?ve only had it for today, but it drives great! I plan to keep it until the wheels fall off!"
"10  8, 2017",Great Car,We have owned several RAV4's and this one is the best by far. The ride is smooth and the safety features make the RAV a joy to drive.
"10  7, 2017",Very reliable I even own a 1997 rav4 still working,"All my needs meet and more , great safty feature and comfort. The car runs well and has great mpg. Great upgrade from my old rav4 but still as reliable and well put together."
"10  7, 2017","Excellent features. Drive smoothly.,safe& secure.","I just love everything in the car. Though it took time to read the manual and comprehend all the detail features. Love super white/ ash. Looks classic, also body style. Run smoothly and beautifully. I do recommend greatly to my neighbors and friends.. They loved it too. It's so roomy. View camera and Radar I. Front and rear.Bird's  eye view, Blind spot monitor, Rear Cross Traffic Alert.ECO drive mode. Blue Tooth Device.Star safety System.TPMS., LDA W/SA, DRCC,PCS W/PD, TSS-P and vehicle stability Control. So much to keep you safe and secure."
"10  6, 2017",equipped with many safety features,I actually did not go there to buy a car but was impressed with the value and price along with the financial options
"10  5, 2017",Much better mpg,"We have found the mileage to be significantly better than the EPA stated 22/29.  We see 25/32.  We are not aggressive drivers.  The limited trim is really nice, and we love the 8-way adjustable drivers seat.   First gear is geared for a brisk start if needed. Plenty of pep.  Love the included safety features."
"10  5, 2017",Another great Rav4,This is my third Rav 4 and my 7th Toyota. The reliability is absolutely great.  My car is the right size for me and my lifestyle.  The extra cargo room is just what I need
"10  4, 2017",Great SUV,"This SUV meets all of our needs and has exceeded our expectations. It rides smoothly, has all of the safety features to give us confidence, with power and good gas mileage!"
"10  3, 2017",LOVE my RAV4,"Spent a lot of time researching and test-driving all different makes and models. So thrilled with my decision. My RAV4 has everything I wanted in a vehicle, for a great price.  It has ample room, handles well and is a pleasure to drive."
"10  3, 2017",You can rave about the RAV.,"This is an excellent vehicle. I came from a 2016 CR-V EX to the RAV4 XLE. The RAV has a somewhat better and quieter ride. It's still a small SUV but it is noticeable that it improves on both marks. It has far more safety features than the CR-V although Honda has now put them all into all models. There are a few issues that make it a 4.5 not a 5. 

The forward most cup holder is only good for shorter beverage containers or other stuff you may want handy. The automatic climate control A/C is slow to turn on. Even though it's still set from the last time the car was driven it takes 8-9 seconds before air begins flowing from the vents. That may not seem like much but on a south Texas 98 degree day with 72% humidity it is a very long time. 

The rear seat head restraints block too much of the view out the back window. Even with them pivoted forward as much as they will pivot and the rear seat backs reclined as much as they will recline they still impose a fair amount on rearward visibility. Lastly, the sound system, even with the fancy JBL upgrade, is mediocre. With the fader set one step up from 100% rear speakers you still only hear the front speakers. If you adjust it any more, the one last step available, then the fronts are turned off and it's only the rear speakers at maybe half the volume of the fronts. 

Those issues aside, it is still overall a great vehicle. I am pleased with my purchase."
"10  3, 2017",Great SUV,"This SUV has met all of our needs. We are very pleased with the ride, safety features, cargo space and the visibility is good for my wife who has had trouble seeing in others in this class."
"10  1, 2017",I've the RAV4,"I had a RAV4 previously, and then switched to something else. Switched back because I love the RAV4 so much! Great design, comfort and safety features."
"09 29, 2017",So far has met all my expectations,"I like how it looks and handles.  Also it gets better gas mileage than I thought it would.   It is easy to see out of and I like that my wife can adjust the seat up so she can see out of it better.  I have not driven it in snow as of yet, but if it handles as well as it does now it will be great.  I did take me a while to figure out all the displays but that is just me."
"09 29, 2017",Great driving comfort and back support.,Love it. Suggest better adjustment range on air vents in front and a possible air vent for back passengers. All else is great.
"09 28, 2017",I love my RAV4!,"The RAV4 has a comfortable drive, plenty of leg room, seats are great for the back, lots of head room. It has great safety features such as lights that tell me if a car is in my blind spot and back up camera. I like my heated seats, sun roof and roof racks."
"09 28, 2017",It works for us.,My wife is short and the seats go up high so see can see to drive and she still has the comfort and control.  I am able to lower the seats and have the same comfort.
"09 25, 2017",Enthused about my new RAV4 LTD!,"Hadn't planned on making a purchase when I took my 2011 Corolla LE in for normal servicing at my dealership, Chicago Northside Toyota, but with a good salesman and financing I couldn't pass up, 3-hrs later I was the proud owner of a new 2017 RAV4 LTD!  In fact, my RAV is so new that I have yet to get acquainted with all of its options but so far the menu-driven features and electronics are quite user-friendly--and I'm not one who is very tech-savvy. When driving there is almost no ambient road noise and the ride is so smooth that you hardly feel all the irregularities in the road."
"09 25, 2017","Sleek, comfortable, reliable Toyota product","2nd RAV4 ......had 1st for 13 years.....will never drive anything other kind of car!   Excited about its bigger size, cargo space, and up to date features!"
"09 23, 2017","Quality, Reliable SUV",This SUV has met all my expectations. This Limited AWD SUV rides nice and has all the bells and whistles.
"09 23, 2017",Heaven on wheels,Bought this car due to all new safety enhancements. It is the Platinum model. Beautiful car. I am over the moon happy.
"09 23, 2017",excellent suv for city and country,"purchased a new Toyota RAV 2017. I'm a big guy, 6'2"" and big-boned, There is still some room behind me with the seat backed up all of the way. The features and smart key are a nice touch. I am used to a V-6 FWD vehicle, so it has taken some time getting used to the slower acceleration in normal or ECO mode. In Sport mode, the acceleration is good. I really like the looks of this car. It just stinks you have to go  Limited model to get dark interiors, but I'll deal with it."
"09 23, 2017",Love our Rav 4,Ours is black and it is a familiar car. We feel safe driving it and that's why we care about. It is very nice outside and inside and we love to visit places on it. Great adquisition
"09 23, 2017",Safety AND Comfort!,"The 2017 RAV4 has many safety features and I especially like the blind spot indicator mirrors as other vehicles I have owned were dangerous to drive on multi lane highways. The lane indicator lets me know when I drift out of my lane or forget to use my turn signals when turning or passing.
The RAV4 also has a solid and comfortable feel and the ride is pleasurable. I also like a higher ride for better visibility.
We have owned several Toyota Camrys and they have been dependable with very few major repairs and we feel confident that our RAV4 will perform with the same dependability."
"09 22, 2017",The right size for me,"It is comfortable, not too big and easy to drive and park. I like the easy load in the back. I like the size of the vehicle and also that it is a all wheel drive."
"09 22, 2017",Great SUV Terrible Buying Experience,"Great vehicle.  Fun to drive.  Love all the safety features.  Practically will drive itself.  Worst buying experience of my life. McGeorge Toyota in Richmond, VA had two day notice I would be picking up vehicle.  They even knew what time of day.  I was there four hours just to take delivery."
"09 21, 2017",the car is great and good on gas,love it and the back up camera.The sale people are very nice and helpful I have got 3 trucks and 3 cars  from the same sales man Ali even the service department is great
"09 21, 2017",I Love It!!,"I have driven a sedan for years and wanted a crossover.
My Avalon (Toyota) has severed me with no problems for 20 years.  I wanted new, dependable, long lasting and fun to
drive.  The Toyota Rava4 is IT for me.  It's nice to sit up high
and drive such a peppy, responsive car."
"09 20, 2017",Love the car. Hate the navigation system!,"I am please with every aspect of this car with the exception of the navigation system! It's not a god, it's junk!  No moving map. No smartphone no navigation. My 2013 Prius had a much better system. Why go backwards toyota?!  Ugh!"
"09 20, 2017",Best value for the money,"Gas saver AWD,  the most safety features in the base model in its class . A bit too much road noise and the inside cloth could be replaced with better materials but overall great reliable car with a bold design unique features in base trim such as lane departure assist,  active radar cruise control , automatic high beams . It is my everyday  work horse and my weekend getaway car. Great little suv."
"09 19, 2017",Typical Toyota....solid and dependable,"It is solid transportation. A bit under powered, but gives a feeling of rock solid transportation. It is sporty and attractive outside. It is my 3rd Rav 4."
"09 19, 2017",Love the car! Amazing styling very comfortable.,Lots of leg room in the back is a huge bonus! Husband is 6'3 and can fit comfortably. Plenty of cargo space. Easy to drive and you get a lot for your money . Test drive the Mazda cx5 it was nice but the back seat was way to small for a baby carseat. The mpg is ok in the rav4 I usually get around 20 mpg. Has nice pick up when pulling out into traffic . Love all of the safety features and back up camera.
"09 19, 2017",Not a Highway Vehicle,The driver comfort is good except for the unreasonably loud and obnoxious road noise that this car allows into the cabin.  Good for around town but don't plan highway trips.
"09 19, 2017","Good old reliable, high quality Toyota!","Other than getting 21 mpg despite being rated at 25 and me driving carefully, this vehicle is a winner all around. If Toyota could get rid of the delay between when I key voice-to-text or to call someone, it would be a good thing. I've had to voice train the system twice."
"09 18, 2017",Rav4 my new car,Love my car economy and easy to drive  anywhere that I'll go.   Pedro and Miguel excellent.  Worth to drive all the way to Northlake
"09 18, 2017",Most practical car I have considered buying.,I loved it and want to buy one soon!! It is stylish and has everything you could possibly want in and on a car. The interior is beautiful too!!
"09 18, 2017",Very reliable,"Very comfortable, great interior, easy navigate , love the comparison with 2016 model and see the great value added options"
"09 18, 2017",Love my new rav4.,"Economical, roomy, sporty. Got to love it. You put it all together for me. I will drive this car to calif. And back to n.m. at least two or three times  per year."
"09 18, 2017",Great safety features,"Rides nice.  Descent pick up,  for a 4 cylinder.  Safety features are top of the line. Has plenty of storage."
"09 18, 2017",Impressed by new RAV4,"Very impressed with Rudd and quality. Wish it had Apple CarPlay.

Much better ride and feel than the previous RAV4 we had (2013 model)"
"09 18, 2017",Most desired car ever,"it`s a nice car, I would like to have Rav4 Limited or XLE as soon as possible. It`s really comfortable and affordable."
"09 18, 2017",Nice vehicle but thought ride would be smoother,Plenty of leg and cargo room. Looks great. It i expected a smoother ride but I've never owned this type of  vehicle. Only Solara and Camry.
"09 18, 2017",smooth ride,just what I wanted.  Great smooth ride.  color is excellent. fantastic features. electronics sound great.  safety features are excellent.
"09 16, 2017",Love my RAV4!!! I will always drive a Toyota!,This is best car I have ever owned! I will always drive a Toyota! I bought it from Fowler Toyota in Tulsa oklahoma. I would go back there any day!!!
"09 14, 2017",Better then Ford,"sweet ride very pretty and after 40 years with ford it was worth the change
love the style and the moon roof the best"
"09 13, 2017",great suv!,I like the design of this vehicle. I also love the interior and room it provides. It handles great. I also like the gas mileage it gets and the whole performance of this great vehicle.
"09 13, 2017",Stylish and peppy for a 4 cyl.,Much more power than our previous 2014 CRV-EX and more stylish. Tech needs to be simpler but we figured it out. Needs power trunk door and certainly XM radio. My 2010 Equinox has XM! Very happy with this car and it's quiet interior outperformed Honda CRV.
"09 12, 2017",Good solid car,I like  the way the car drives and it is a very comfortable ride. I am disappointed in the interior storage of the Rav 4. I had  more interior storage in my camry. I liked the coin box in the camry and wish I had on in my Rav 4. I also liked the bigger consul in the camry. It holds more materials than the Rav 4. I do like the space in the Rav 4 and the fact that I am riding higher up. The seats are comfortable but a larger person may be uncomfortable with the sides of the seat pressing into them. Good car and I hope it lasts me a long time.
"09 12, 2017",yes,"I had a 2014 rav 4 leased and let it go back after lease and then bought  a 2016 jeep patroit and was very disappointed with it,  Gas milage was very bad and ride was not nearly good as the rav 4 so i traded it back  and got another rav 4 and am very pleased with it. The jeep lost $14,000 off sticker the first year and will stay with toyota from now on."
"09 11, 2017",Good. Performance. Interior updates required,"Car is good, good performance. Value for the money with other competitors. Still need more interior updates required."
"09 11, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,Has met all of my needs besides that it don't have Xm radio other than that great car................
"09 11, 2017",My third RAV4,"Most reliable, affordable, comfortable, and sporty small SUV  I have ever owned. The mold that every other small SUV was built on."
"09 10, 2017",Smooth Ride,We were shopping for a new vehicle as we have 3 young drivers in our home. The Rav 4 met all our criteria! Sporty but practical...roomy - sport bags need room!...safety features plus ...smooth ride and comfort plus!!!
"09 10, 2017",Great Upgrade,Upgraded from a Nissan Sentra and couldn't be happier. Runs much more smoothly and there's plenty of leg room in the back seats. Bluetooth feature and back up camera are a couple of my favorite tech additions.
"09  9, 2017",Best purchase of a vehicle yet.,"Great car. Seats 4 comfortably. Great leg room and storage space. Smooth ride, handles great. Has all the amenities i need."
"09  9, 2017",love the visibility it provides,"I drive the Limited.  This is my first SUV and am very impressed with all the features and the ride.  My husband drives the LE and, also, is just as happy,  We are impressed with all they offer."
"09  9, 2017",had less than 1 mo but so far it awesome,"This car meets all our needs, the reclining rear seats, and safety features like blind spot and radar that keeps me from a collision, and slows me down to slower moving traffic when on cruse control,  and the power lift gate for loading is a must for us. We test drove a Honda CRV and the Rave for us road better and had the power lift gate and reclining rear seats. It has more APS than I have figured out yet but like the traffic AP than shows me the streets  all around me in town."
"09  7, 2017",Great value in a SUV,I recently bought this car at Haley Toyota in Midlothian VA. Justin Ali was my salesman and he got me a great deal and was so easy to work with. I test drove several other SUVs but chose the Toyota primaril based on styling of the vehicle and relabilty.
"09  7, 2017","Best car,money can buy","This was my third toyota..And I swear by them.I still think of that comercial.Love my toyota.Its true,I loved everyone of them.No problems or issue.never had to put money into them .they just drove forever..I cant believe how great they are."
"09  7, 2017",Cutest SUV on the road,"I love the 2017 RAV 4, Limited.  Why? The RAV4 is compact, but feels roomy inside. The back seats recline which my teenagers love. The Entune audio and navigation suite are incredible and easy to use and the dash has stylish stitching. This car breaks for you, tells you are too close to objects when parking, it auto corrects you gently if you accidentally cross into another lane, but the best feature is the blind spot alert. An amber light comes on on your side mirrors if a car is coming from behind and entering your blind spot. This is a great feature on the freeway for changing lanes.  Another thing I love is the keyless entry and auto hatch lift. No more trying to close the rear gate with arms full of groceries. 
the doors also auto unlock as you approach the car and lock with a fingertip touch on the handle. I am in love with this darling SUV. This is the perfect family car. Even a roof rack for the Christmas tree."
"09  5, 2017",Looking for a long time.,"I've rented a couple of  Rav 4's and liked them.  I liked the MPG and the Toyota Safety Sense.  I bought the LE, probably should have looked at the XLE before making a final decision to buy.  The Toyota Safety Sense is available on the LE as standard equipment which is nice.  This is definitely the bottom of the line Rav 4, but it has some nice standard features, like backup camera which is amazing."
"09  5, 2017",2nd Rav4 I have owned,I love the Rav4 2017.  The only thing I don't care for is the black interior.  The seats show every thing and lint sticks to them badly.
"09  5, 2017",family car,"is a comfortable vehicle inside, beautiful design on the outside and definitely one of the most reliable brands."
"09  5, 2017","a great small SUV, in looks and drive",this car meets all my needs. Plenty of leg room front and back and a very spacious cargo area for a smaller SUV
"09  5, 2017",First small SUV,So far so good.Only a couple weeks.But for the size of the engine it supprizes me with the pick up and go.Easy on gas.Ride is nice and smooth.Takes bumps OK.The only thing missing is a CD player not offered????If I did it again I would get a Platinum Edition.Didnt realize they had one.I bought the Limited 4 Wheel Drive. But so far it's been great.NO COMPLAINTS.NO BUYERS REMORSE!!!
"09  3, 2017",Great vehicle,Meets all of my expectations from interior to exterior and reasonably priced. So far I've had an excellent experience with the rav 4
"08 31, 2017",Brand New Rav4 XLE AWD,"Traded in my 2010 Camry, and this is quite a change!  Very comfortable ride, nice quick handling and a short turning radius.   I was worried it might be a ""rough"" ride, but it's very comfortable.  I am 6-1"", and have tons of legroom.  Visibility is surprisingly good.. my old Camry has bad blind spots.  Toyota Safety Sense is mind blowing... the car slowed down when some pulled out in front of me, and slowed me down when I came over the crown of a hill and there was a slower truck there!  I feel the car has plenty of power, and in Eco mode I showed 31.5 Mpg... the same as my Camry!!  Quiet and comfortable while commuting...90% of my miles are road miles. Only had this a short time, but very impressed, especially the tech!"
"08 30, 2017",First SUV for me.,Newly purchased.  Enjoying the features included so far.  I feel very safe with the 8 airbags included.
"08 30, 2017",Youssef,"Most reliable car i have driven, 
I prefer have it for the family
We have already one 2015 RV4
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE LEXUS
AND WE HAVE TWO MORE 
FR THE SAME FAMILY"
"08 29, 2017",First Time Rav4 Owner,"We have  had a Camry, Corolla, and 2 Highlanders.  We are downsizing and did so on the car also getting this Rav4.  It is more than expected....good room, good pickup.  Great value."
"08 29, 2017",Great Car,"I had driven Toyota for many years, the company furnished the Toyota and I fell in love with this name brand. After retirement I tried a couple GM cars and they just do not measure up to the Toyota Product."
"08 28, 2017",Very comfortable ride-with back support,"There is lots of room is a RAV4 XLE-it is so comfortable, and has great back support.  I love my car.  It handles well on the road and has a lot of extras."
"08 26, 2017",Very reliable car,I love how it handles in the snow and overall handling is great the car has great options I love the auto headlights and the lane blind spot alert and the seats are really comfy
"08 24, 2017",Best car for the money,It rides well looks well feels well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"08 24, 2017",Toyota  is my favorit car,"Toyota in 20 years has been the car safe, economic and very  good perfomance. I recomended to trust you road . You will be in good hands.Jesus in my toyota we served to the Cleveland community."
"08 24, 2017",Awesome vehicle,"This years new features are a plus.  Navigation, push to start and driver alert system is a great safety value for my money."
"08 23, 2017",Excellent car choice,"The  RAV4 has everything I was looking for in a vehicle.  Navigation ,sunroof ,back up camera ,remote starter, soo many safety features,  great smooth ride I'm very happy with my new auto"
"08 19, 2017",2017 RAV4,"This is the second RAV  I have owned.  I like the roomy cargo space as I haul a lot of equipment in it.   It has good clearance when I am on the ranch and I find it well appointed for use around town.   The only down side is it does not have a real spare tire.  I would prefer a deeper spare compartment with a real spare.   The older models that had four wheel drive had a real wheel mounted on the back.   However, when I compared other like models, it was clear the RAV was the best choice.   AWD, good gas mileage, comfortable ride, large cargo area, etc."
"08 19, 2017",Reliable Car,I think of Rav4 XLE met all my needs and no addition feature into my Rav4. I don't have to complain my parents that cars are quite the useful to take you other places might come in handy. As long its safety and work pretty well.
"08 18, 2017",A very happy choice,"Room, comfort , economy and technology.....a very good blend of what you would like in a mid size SUV....I especially like the 18 inch wheels on the SE AWD model I purchased."
"08 17, 2017",Extended Warranty,Buying my RAV4 next week Did anyone get the extended warranty What did it cost you?  Love the car so far just do not know if I need or the cost I should pay for the warranty
"08 16, 2017",3 TIME OWNER,"MY THRID ONE STARTED WITH THE XL. HAVE MOVED UP TO THE LIMITED. LOVE THE CROSSOVER WILL NOT GO BACK TO A CAR. LOVE THE NEW FEATURES,  POWER SEATS, GARAGE DOOR OPENER,  CRUISE, LANE DETECTION AND BACKUP WARNING."
"08 16, 2017",Best car I have ever bought,Best vehicle I've ever owned very happy with it it was hassle-free to deal with the dealership my salesman Jay invite was excellent I would recommend him to any of my friends or people I know
"08 15, 2017",Nice and economical,"First off let me say I owned a 2013 Ford Escape and sold it to buy the Rav4.  I bought this vehicle in early March of 2017 and I now have 14000 miles on it...yes, I drive a lot!  80 miles round trip a day to and from work, I average 28.2 MPG on my AWD SE.  
  I love the looks of the vehicle inside and out, the SE model has the LED/HID headlamps and tail lights, looks great!  This model also has the power lift gate, which by the way, you can adjust how high it opens very easily.  I have the ""soft-tex"" seats (Toyota's answer to leather)  feels nice and looks good with the SE red stitching.  I have to say that the seats could have more padding, as they are a bit uncomfortable after several hours of driving.  The ECO mode is fine, but the SPORT mode gives you the extra ""zip"" that I like to feel in a vehicle.  It has to do with the transmission gearing when put in SPORT mode.  Either way my MPG's have stayed the same, 28.2!  Another issue I have is that not all of the dashboard buttons are lit for night driving, I find this irritating...really?!?!  The ""safety sense"" features are great!  Saved me from an accident just the other day...whew!  Blind spot monitoring, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and back up camera are great!  The ""Entune HD"" radio/cd player has a very good sound, better than other vehicles I have owned.  The rear seats lean back or fold down flat for cargo.  I had two teens sit back there for a 10 hour trip and they said it was nice, plenty of room.  I'm 6'-4"", and 255 lbs. and I have no issues with headroom or legroom in front or back.  Handling is a bit more stiff on the SE model, harder suspension...almost no roll going around corners or handling at high speeds on highways.  Visibility is good except out the back but you have a camera so...Overall I am happy with the RAV4."
"08 15, 2017",Worst car ever,"There are too many other options out there I wish I had considered. Take your time and shop for value, reliability, and comfort. The paint is already peeling. Biggest regret of my life!"
"08 15, 2017",Choose RAV4 over of CRV and Rogue,"Gave away my 2006 Honda CRV and bought a 2017 Toyota RAV4. Look at Nissan Rogue but the CVT transmission has a lag so when you step on the gas pedal there is a slight hesitation. RAV4 has a 6 gear auto transmission, is has much better acceleration. Look at Honda CRV but it is thousands of dollars more, also uses a CVT transmission pluls CRV does not have an all-around the vehicle camera. With RAV4 I can see the entire car from a top down view plus it has four warning sensors on all four corners. Parking is so easy."
"08 15, 2017",Very Smooth Driving,Has so many safety features which is very important to me.  I like the back up camera too..  Very comfortable and love the aqua metallic color. Has lot of space in back for suitcases and more.
"08 14, 2017",Feels and drives luxurious !,"Love everything about car except no place to stash purse, umbrellas, etc.  Maybe better design
 of glovebox ."
"08 14, 2017",Well suited car for all ages,"The 2017 Rav 4 is a vehicle suited for any age driver.
It is a vehicle that is easy to handle, and has all the safety features that are necessary for safe driving.
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a safe comfortable ride."
"08 13, 2017",Overall great car,"Safe, reliable, ease of drive Received many compliments about the car.  Would highly recommend it.  Love ot"
"08 13, 2017",My first brand new car,This car is iust what i need ritght now.  My kids love it too. Enough room for the in d back for the kids.
"08 13, 2017",Love my Rav,Love all the standard safety features this small SUV has. And it was priced just right. Color chosen black current very different and my vehicle was detail with strip to match my interior seat.
"08 12, 2017",Just traded for this new car & am loving it so far,"Have only had it for one week, but am loving it so far.  Great value for the cost, drives like a champ and has great safety features, like lane departure alert, accident avoidance feature that helps you stop quicker to prevent you from having an accident, or at least keeps you from hitting something so hard.  Sorry but I can't think of the names of the feature right now.  Anyway, I'm glad to have them.  Hopefully, though, I won't need them.  LOL"
"08 11, 2017",love this car,"This is my fourth Toyota.  Test drove other SUVs, this was the most comfortable, solid and fun to drive.   I loved my previous car, a Camry, but haven't missed it at all!   The primary uses listed below don't give a good option for a retired person's primary vehicle!  I live out in the country and have to drive quite a distance for most of what I need to do and I need a car I can depend on."
"08  9, 2017",Super value,"The Rav4 is the perfect size for me.  It has plenty of cargo room, as well as cabin room.  The standard features are phenomenal!"
"08  7, 2017",very nice car. lot of safety features,very nice vehicle.  real good gas mileage  lot of safety features.looks good. drives good. just all around good vehicle
"08  7, 2017",Very good car,"This is a good, reliable car that is comfortable and attractive, gets good mileage, will get me through bad winter driving (hills), and was affordable."
"08  5, 2017",Easy driver,"Having driven a Highlander for 13 years, I find the ride very stiff and disappointing, especially on rough pavement.
Appreciate the safety features. Handles easily, very responsive. So many new electronic features, it is difficult to assimilate. I miss not having a CD player."
"08  4, 2017",Love the Rav4!,"I absolutely love this car, very spacious, drives well, and has so many awesome features. I love using the moon roof in my car and the remote start. This dashboard is extremely easy to learn how to use, and the Toyota safety sense is a great added feature. My only complaint is that this car is not push to start/key less entry. Other than that this car is also really good on gas and I am very happy with my purchase."
"08  3, 2017",Blue,I really like my new car. I love being able to play my music from Pandora via Bluetooth. I love the lane assistance and when I am using cruise control it slows down if the car in front is slowing down. I LOVE THAT!!! Helps you stay focused when driving!!!!
"08  2, 2017",Most advanced car I have owned,"We really enjoy this car but have had for only two weeks and 500 miles so far so hard to rate reliability. The technology is incredible especially the Blind Spot Monitoring system, well worth the cost. We got the Platinum model with all the bells and whistles. It will take awhile to figure it all out but mostly very easy if you just read the manuals. There is enough power for getting on the highway especially for 176hp but I am used to a 540hp Shelby GT500 so I am pleased so far. I would recommend anyone to get the Platinum package since you won't need anything else. I have had three other Toyotas in the past but this is the first new one in 20years so I hope the reliability on this one will match the others that I didnt get rid of until they had 150k miles on them."
"08  2, 2017",My New Baby,"I love my new Rav4. I have always wanted a Rav4 and I finally took the step. I have had a PriusV for the last 5 years, because of my 100 mile a day commute. Once my job moved and my commute is now 50 miles a day, I went for it with the Rav4. I love the comfort and the sporty style. I chose the Aqua color and it is beautiful, looks black but depending on how you look and the sun, it is beautiful. I love all the new safety features on this SUV. I don't know why I didn't buy one a long time ago"
"08  2, 2017",Most comfortable,We feel more comfortable in the seatings in the car when compared to pathfinder as we use additional seat cushions to protect from back pain.
"07 30, 2017",Under SUV Category.this is the best CAR I can say,"Good CAR with all expected options...mainly it's really good for the places where snowing    
          ."
"07 29, 2017",Amazed with the basic model,I currently own the 2017 rav4 le and I'm amazed with what it comes with as a basic model wonder how nice the limited is
"07 28, 2017",Best car I've owned,"I love it and I am rest assured that, it would take me forever. 
It met all my needs and it is a great car"
"07 27, 2017",Drivabiity,"This car met my expectations-very solid driving, well equipped inside & good looks outside. All the safety features included in price are a big incentive to purchase this vehicle."
"07 27, 2017",Best car i ever own it!,"This car is deffinetly worth the money paid. It has all you need at todays life style.
Very comfortable, reliable, lot of safety feautures,sleek, modern
Love this car"
"07 27, 2017",New Car,"This is my second Rav4 - with a few new bells and whistles it seems the perfect car.  Reliable, good power, comfortable."
"07 27, 2017",Excellent Midsize SUV,Overall the vehicle is excellent with a great exterior and interior finish. The SUV handles well in the City and on the Highway. It includes Eco and Sport Mode which is a neat feature. It also has lane assist. The backseats recline which is an excellent addition for children on a road trip.
"07 25, 2017",Best car overall,Wonderful car .. with great get up and go love the interior settings.. ease of handling overall best car I have ever driven.. best. Egoiyioations.. no hassle with sale.. good gas mileage. . Love this car
"07 24, 2017",Our dream,"Purchased XLE , knew what we wanted. Put down payment through credit card and we had little to do when we went to pick it up. Did not expect a sales pitch on extended warranty, hence we did it in ignorance and a little good salesmanship. Would not do it again and I have heard from a relative that the price is negotiable. Toyota does not have as good a warranty as I would like. Carpet is cheap. The rest so far is our new toy and our prize possession. Too bad they do not last!!!"
"07 24, 2017",The best vehicle I have ever owned!,"I am throughly happy with my Rav. It is roomy but not too big., easy to handle and very nice to drive and is so comfortable."
"07 24, 2017",hot car,"I have had many different brands of cars as I am 75 years old. This is the best car for driving and all the features it has. I like that I have a better eye view while I drive. The storage is easier to remove things from the trunk as they just slide out a lot better, no lifting up over the trunk base. I like the feature if you start to wander it will beep to let you know this, very good safety measure. Can't say enough about this car."
"07 23, 2017",The best SUV available,"After trying the rest of vehicles in this class, it is now time to buy and drive the best. The safety, efficiency, comfort and performance will leave nothing to the imagination nor to be desired."
"07 22, 2017",The size which I need for my family.,Essentially our family need. The other most attractive factor for us to buy this vehicle is the 0% APR from the manufacturing company.
"07 21, 2017",Best cars to own,"This car will go a long way and look good at the same time. Beautifully designed and has a lot of horse power despite it being an SUV. Cheap parts, once a year oil change and great service. My RAV4 has become my best friend."
"07 21, 2017",best car for the money,this car was an upgrade from a 2015 RAV4 it is top of the line with all the safety upgrades the heated seats are great on my back. I love the space for driving as I am about 260 pounds and there is plenty of room for me.
"07 20, 2017",RAV4 TOTAL SAFETY SENSE IS GREAT,"I had the 2015 and bought this for the safety features.  The car pushes you back in your lane - GENTLY.  Alarms you if someone is behind when your backing up, grandchildren, YIKES.  Side mirrors lite up if a car is in your blindspot.  Excellent vehicle."
"07 17, 2017",great all round suv for the family,"meets all our needs,rear seats spilt for more room in back....reclining rear seats are a great feature .love the reversing camera...and the blind spot wing mirrors...heated front seats are awesome for the winters..."
"07 15, 2017",Like it,"Overall, I am very pleased with this vehicle.  A modern 2.5 liter should have more power though.  My pickup has a 2.7 liter Eco-Boost with way more power and the gas efficiency is almost as good as the RAV4.  Obviously, Toyota has a way to go to catch up in that area.   Other than that, I believe it has the best cars on the road.  My experience has been that they last longer and drive better than most with less problems."
"07 13, 2017",Great Car,"We don't buy cars very often and that is why we have bought our last four cars with a Toyota label.  We just replaced our 2006 Corola for a 2017 RAV 4 and love it!
(we got a great price for our Corola too)  Our RAV 4 is VERY comfortable, sleek looking, plenty of room for passengers and stuff.  We are three weeks away for a trip to California from Indiana.  Can't wait!
There are soooo many new things that were not available in 2006 and we are really enjoying every one of them.  Don't cheat yourself.  Test drive a RAV 4.  You won't regret it.  Rick
If you haven't test driven a Toyota RAV 4 you are cheating yourself."
"07 12, 2017",Looking forward to buy one,We needed more room for family of four and I found Rav4 is the best vehicle for us. More legroom and spacious.
"07 12, 2017",Nice but not my favorite,This car has a nice interior and exterior. I wasnt as excited as I should've been when it was purchased brand new a few months ago.
"07 11, 2017",Wish It was a Plug-In Hybrid :),"I love this Rav4. Wish it came plug-in ready - nothing a bit of DIY can't fix, but come on Toyota! Would also have opted for a solar power sunroof if that was an option."
"07 11, 2017",RAV4 XLE best car I've ever owned,"Love the style, the interior options, sunroof, seat material, Bluetooth, easy open lift gate, push car start, smooth ride, 23 miles per gallon in town, steering assist, braking assist, lane departure alert, pre-collision detection, back up camera,reclining and fold flat 2nd row seats, privacy glass, blind side detection. GREAT!!"
"07 10, 2017",Great car,I really like it I did have the interior leather changed from the brown to a matching blue color .I like all the new safety things on this vehicle it should last a long time
"07  9, 2017",A very nice crossover,"The 2017 Rav 4 XLE is everything I was looking for. The back seats are very spacious for our tall teenage children. Very nice features such as variable cruise control, nice electronics, comfortable seats and drives like your on a cloud.
The sales staff was very perfessional and informative. I am very happy with my purchase."
"07  9, 2017",nicest model yet,"This car is comfortable and easy to drive.  It rides well and has a nice sleek, updated look.  This is the third Rav4 I have owned.  Each one keeps getting better and more sturdy."
"07  8, 2017",Well equiped and great overall package,"Good mileage, comfortable and all safety features easy to use. Found BT linking to apps. confusing ."
"07  8, 2017",Love Toyota!,"Loved the Rav4! We are a Toyota family! I liked the extra safety features and the automatic lift for the hatch back on the limited Rav 4. I also like the Bluetooth, USB and hands free phone features."
"07  6, 2017",Smart Investment,"I love my new Rav 4. The safety features alone and the peace of mind this gives me. I bought this car for my wife and my two 5 year old twins. I feel much better when They are out and about. The design is great. With all the great electronic features this car has. 2 small improvements I would suggest, power seats would be awesome. And when the car is sold update the navigation system before handing off to the buyer. Or include a map update in the sales package."
"07  5, 2017",Loving it!!!!,"I absolutely love it! Roomy, stylish, comfortable,  and great gas mileage.  I love all the safety features and how smooth of a ride it is. Lots of storage space too!!!"

"07  3, 2017",Very comfortable car,It serves my purpose. It is very very comfortable car. This has a value of money. This is the best price i got for this type of car.
"07  3, 2017",Love My NEW CAR,"Great Mid Size Car! My first SUV. Drives  nice and smooth! Nice leg room; great sound system. The radio sounds so clear. Lots of Standard features and in other cars would Cost Extra!
My Daughter wants one now!"
"07  2, 2017","So exceptional, I bought another one!","My RAV4 is exactly what everyone would want in a small SUV. The look is just sporty enough, but provides the ultimate in safety and handling. The size fits me, as I can slide right in and the controls are so accessible. The Rav4's performance and reliability are what gives it the added appeal. When I compared the Rav 4 to other models, it ranked far above the rest. Throughly pleased with my purchase!"
"07  1, 2017",Names say for all.,"Toyota being a leader in manufacturing of great cars. The reliability is unbeaten by anyone in today's market, being said that their car in long run worth every penny you have send on. 

Toyota as I have owned have given me what I want and truly have great models and safety features, as most of the other have started to provide one after they interduced in 2017."
"06 30, 2017",Good vehicle,The car is new with many features. I am glad to know that Mr. Jerry Melton is still selling cars. the car has many features I have not used them all as yet. I drives smooth and good.
"06 29, 2017",I previously owned a Rav 4 used as trade in Love,"Love it, meets all my needs, great gas mileage, very comfortable to drive long distances. I would recommend a Rav 4 to everyone"
"06 28, 2017",I had a 2011 RAV4 before this one and loved it.,"This vehicle is even nicer than the RAV4 I had before.  I love the black currant color and the inside is terrific.  I love the RAV4's so much, I gave the 2011 I had to my grandson who just loves it.  Fran"
"06 27, 2017",Rav it up,"I love my new Rav4 Limited edition. I still find myself looking for places to go so I can ride around in it. I previously owned a Toyota Camry and until the day I sold it ( to a co-worker who knew what a great car it was and what good care it had ) and said good by. Even after I bought an Acura I kept the Camry for awhile, I had a hard time parting with it. I`m already attached to my new Rav4. It rides so nice, seating is very comfy and ample. I love the safety features, I`m all for safety and prevention. It has too many great features to get into.......just take one for a drive and you will see. Toyota makes great products that are reliable, made roomy and comfortable and they have style and class. I am sooo ready for a rode trip with my new Rav4."
"06 26, 2017","Love, love, love my car!","I just love my car.  It is by far one of the most comfortable vehicles I've ever been in.   By far, it is the best car I've ever driven.  Its' seats are extremely comfortable. I really like the design of the dash board.  It just seems to me that everything is in the right place.  The car handless like a dream.  You really should test drive one.  You'll love it!"
"06 24, 2017",my third Rav 4....bulletproof,"Solid, dependable vehicle. A bit underpowered, but has enough power to get the job done. New design is sharp. Attractive inside and out."
"06 24, 2017",Very reliable.,I am very satisfied with my choice. It's my first Toyota and I love it. I know it will serve its purpose.
"06 24, 2017",Great vehicle,"My new Rav 4 is great and very stylish.  I owned another Rav 4 for 11 years and when I traded her in, I knew that I wanted the same make of vehicle."
"06 24, 2017",Our 3rd RAV4! Never buy anything else!!,"We love the RAV4. We just keep buying another. We kept the last one for over 10 years and even then couldn't decide if we should trade for the newer one. There's room for the dogs (German Shepherd, Springer Spaniel) and all the luggage you could ever want to carry. It's never had trouble passing a car or avoiding a problem THEY ARE GREAT!!!"
"06 23, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The safety features such as BSM and forward radar are great. 

We drove the new car 2000 miles to Disney World and it handled great on the highway.

My wife likes the extra visibility that the car offers."
"06 22, 2017",Awesome car!,"The rav 4 is a great car overall, comfortable, sleek style exterior, interior is functional, plenty of space in the back seats for kids and adults! The trunk has great space capacity. A great family car, would highly recommend it!"
"06 22, 2017",Awesome vehicle,"Comfortable, great pick up for a 4 cylinder.   Style is and out is fantastic.  Very roomy.  Lots of extras that come standard."
"06 21, 2017",Worst SUV,"This is a silk purse made from a pigs skin, in other words appearances are deceiving. Very very very thin sheet metal on the main body, engine knock at 800 miles, gas mileage is distorted..gets about 20 city 24 highway normal driving with I passenger. Not capable or worthy of a maintoned gravel road and I would not recommend ever leaving pavement . Seat material is flimsy, dash parts cheap plastic, carpeting is like paper material....."
"06 21, 2017","Excellent ride, handling and economy","Vehicle fills our needs exactly. Handles great, drives well, parks easily and is comfortable.  Great values for the purchase price."
"06 21, 2017",Knew the minute I sat in the driver seat...,"That this vehicle was for me. This is a fun little SUV with tons of safety features. I've got the Limited and am so happy I jumped up my budget for all the extras. The controls are user-friendly, the drivers seat exceptionally comfortable and the ride surprisingly smooth. Kudos to Toyota for a bold new color as well. Black Currant is just plain pretty."
"06 20, 2017",Like it,"Drove the rav4and really like it liked the color  the leather seats the salesman was great and the people, the salesman explained all teachers. .left jasper with a full tank of gas any happy"
"06 19, 2017",Toyota,"I love my New Rav4! It is so comfortable. The dash is so easy to see everything and reach. Having the back up camera and the peeps, if someone is walking behind is awesome. Also with my arms full of packages to be able to wave my foot under the car and my back door opens. The blind spot monitors are a great help. I can park and push a button and see if my car is parked correctley.Handles great on side roads and the freeway. Has a lot of pick up. Nice smooth ride. Will have my Rav4 for a long time!"
"06 18, 2017",Very dependable and comfortable,"I love the comfort and ease of use, all instruments work smoothly.  Very stylish and due to our winters, I am grateful that all wheel drive comes with this model.  Very nice.  Salesperson Miranda M made the whole experience very quick and comfortable."
"06 18, 2017",Very nice care for you money!,"Toyota as we all know are very reliable.
The new Rav4 is very aggressive-looking and sporty on the inside as well. The four cylinder is very reliable not as powerful as some would hope but it still gets the job done. very roomy inside the rear seats recline just like the front. The JBL sound system is amazing. For the price you can't go wrong with the RAV4 test drive one today."
"06 16, 2017",Most sleek car I own,"The color of exterior and interior is what I really wanted.  Economical and dependable. Good legroom, and I got all the features I wanted for a new car."
"06 15, 2017",No problems at all,"Our previous car was a Toyota Camry that was the most reliable car we have ever owned even after 192,000 miles. But even the Camry had to be taken back to the shop a couple times for the first thousand miles or so to fix some initial problems. The RAV4 has had absolutely no problems at all. It appears to be a highly refined design. It is a pleasure to drive. It is probably the last car we will ever own since I am now 75 years old."
"06 12, 2017",Love my new Toyota - totally reliable,The comfort is excellent - awesome suspension which I know I can count on this vehicle to travel not only for commuting but for visiting out of town.
"06 12, 2017",Safest Car on the Road!,"Previous to my leasing my 2017 Rav4 this past weekend, I drove a 2010 Mazda Tribute.  Having bought my lease out 2 years ago, I have been shopping around for the next vehicle to lease.  I knew I wanted a smaller SUV similar to the size of the Tribute, but was looking for safety, reliability, and backseat legroom.  I currently drive for both of my elderly parents and was concerned about their ability to get in and be comfortable in the backseat and have room for walkers, etc.  I am ULTRA IMPRESSED about the safety rating of the Rav4.  I am way passed wanting to impress anyone with my car, but I can say after just 4 days I LOVE my Rav4.  I actually had the opportunity to drive a Rav4 back in 2008 when my car was stolen and was in the shop for repair after recovery.  I drove the rental for a little more than a month and it was what really sparked my interest in the car.  I actually liked the way the tailgate opened then as it is more user friendly for women, but understand the concept of the tailgate lifting open as well.  Since that time, it was always on my radar if the opportunity presented itself."
"06  7, 2017",Love my new car -,"Love the comfort and convenience of my new RAV 4 and Karl Malone Toyota has been great to work with and take care of me and my questions. Of course, I have only had it for two weeks - hope it keeps performing so great!"
"06  6, 2017","I have always loved the Rav, now it is even better",I love this car. It is just as fancy and stylish as a Lexus without the price. I would choose a Toyota every time. I have owned 3 Rav-4.
"06  5, 2017",Great Car for the money. Good value.,Good size SUV.  Handles great on the road.  Great with getting in and out of traffic and parking. Feels sturdy.
"06  5, 2017",Best of the Non Luxury two row SUV's,"We test drove most of the competitive models. We found the RAV4 the best bang for the buck. We got the XLE with convenience package that includes push button start, power lift gate and nav. Rides nicely for a small SUV and the seats are comfortable. Good leg room in the back. We don't  intend to drag race so the 0-60 will do."
"06  3, 2017",2017 Rav4 LE,"We decided on this vehicle for several reasons . The size is perfect for us even as a primary vehicle. We had owned Toyotas before and knew of their reliability and we looking for a smaller vehicle with better fuel milage than the one we had. Even though the LE model is a base model it is equipped with more features than we were expecting, exactly what we were looking for. After 1200 miles we are averaging 26 mpg city, 31 hwy. and 28 over all. We bought this one off the dealers lot but had we ordered we would have ordered the exact same model. Very pleased !!!!!"
"06  2, 2017",My new car I love it,"Everything I wanted  in my new car Moonroof Power Hatch alloy Wheels  blootooth 
Blind spot warning light Toyota reliability"
"06  2, 2017","The 3rd Rav 4 I've owned dependable,built to last","The Rav 4 has a smooth ride can carry a family of four and a dog comfortably.Gas mileage fair and it sharp lines are classy clean,have owned three Rav 4sand enjoyed driving all of them great purchase."
"06  1, 2017",My first Suv,I love it  and absolutely love it. I've wanted this car for a very long time and finally have it. Very smooth drive and roomy.
"05 31, 2017",Shockingly amazing,"I wanted a car with bigger engine but this size. Left me looking at jeep Cherokee but the bigger engine drove poorly, had a 2012 Tucson and it was sluggish and slow but with a similar size engine this car is great to drive and comfortable. Was looking at Infiniti qx30 also and the RAV4 had more features than the Infiniti."
"05 31, 2017",LOVE THIS CAR!,"Drives great!  I feel safe in this vehicle.  The safety features are awesome, and the ride is very smooth."
"05 31, 2017",Better that I ever had,"For family this is the best deal, economy in gas, very quiet, a lot of safety features in the new Rav4."
"05 31, 2017",happyrav4owner,"LOVE.  LOVE.  LOVE.  Everything about this vehicle.  Size is great, gas mileage is good and has all the bells and whistles I wanted!!!"
"05 31, 2017",This is the second RAV 4 we own.,Gives us us everything we need in a car.  Like how it handles and the service is excellent and we liked it so well this is the second RAV 4 we now own.
"05 31, 2017","So far, I love this car.  I only had it 2 weeks...",So far I love this car.  Only have had it for 2 weeks and still learning all the good about it.    I love the open space inside.  Feels great on the road.  I appreciate the beeps when I cross the white or yellow line.. It's a reminder.
"05 30, 2017",Love it!,Very spacious. Really easy to use for someone that's not good with technology. Would recommend it to anyone!
"05 29, 2017",outstanding vehicle,"meets all our needs.Car has many safety items,gets great gas milage,feels  secure on road and is fun to drive."
"05 29, 2017",Fantastic Car,I bought this car about 3 weeks ago.  I had a Camrey and loved it.  This car is large inside with plenty of room to spread out and take a long trip.  The car is very comfortable to ride and drive.  This car can pick up speed quickly in the sport mode and pass cars with ease. It is easy to drive and drives smoothly.
"05 28, 2017",Perfect cat,Great car. Lots of safety features and rides as good as any high dollar car. You will not be sorry if you buy This car.
"05 28, 2017",Great small SUV.,"The RAV4 we purchased is an XLE. It is stylish as well as functional. The Infotainment system keeps you aware of how your car is performing, as well as entertains you. In Sport Mode, the steering is a bit tighter and the pick-up is a bit quicker, which makes merging onto highways easier. I find I usually drive in the ""normal"" mode, which automatically switches to eco mode as you drive, especially when in traffic. It is a fantastic little SUV which has great cargo space for groceries, as well as hauling the usual stuff a family will take with them. Thankfully, my kids are all grown, but for a family with growing kids, it would be great as you have four doors to access the back seats (which have child safety locks), and the ""trunk"" space is ample for carrying the usual child related items. My husband put all of his metal detecting hardware in the trunk and had space left over to put my stuff. I look forward to having this vehicle for the next 10+ years, as I have no doubt it will last that long, even with my 100 mile per day commute to work. I foresee this being an incredible purchase. Toyota has a great reputation for vehicles lasting a long time. My 2002 Sienna served me well until someone hit it in the rear at 60 mph when traffic stopped. It was hard enough to fold it in half. That was in  2008. It gave me absolutely no problems in 6 years. I will bet this RAV4 will do the same. Great vehicle, great deals right now."
"05 27, 2017",Dependable with a Capital B,The RAV-4 is a quiet ride. I like how it gives the option for the engine to give me the option to either use money saving economy miles or give me power when I need it. The standard feature of blue tooth lets me make or receive phone calls just by pushing a button without taking my hands off the steering wheel. I like being able to sit and have a higher view of the road. It maneuvers easily and is able to take sharp turns in residential areas. I feel like I can go anywhere without having something breaking down and can't wait to take it on a long road trip.
"05 27, 2017",Very confortable,"Right fit for me and my family , great size for the family of 4 , enough space , comfortable, easy to navigate, great value"
"05 27, 2017",Most reliable,This car has more legroom trank has more space my children put their bayke in the trank this car more comfortable for driving

"05 25, 2017",Car which your family loves !!,"Best car for a small family.  It's more spacious ,  great mileage , sophisticated maneuver and  great features like  lane departure warning and many more."
"05 25, 2017",incredible car,i love the car.  it handles great. I love the auto high beam functionality as we as the swerve control
"05 25, 2017",Very stylish and sleek interior.,Wanted a vehicle that was easy to get in and out off.  Plus I wanted to be able to pull a small utility trailer.
"05 24, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"The vehicle is comfortable, dependable, and the right size.  The seats adjust for shorter people, making it easier to see the road.  It handles well."
"05 24, 2017",Really Cool Multipurpose vehicle.,"The Rav 4 is pretty cool for a SUV, we've fought long & hard against having one, but in the end we had to give in due to needs. The Rav is small, yet big enough to meet the needs we have as a family. It drives like a car, which isn't something you'll experience in most SUV's"
"05 23, 2017",Reliable and safe vehicle,"Love this car, it is large enough for my needs, but not as large as my former vehicle, gets great gas mileage and has lots of safety features which were very important to me."
"05 23, 2017",LE front drive 2017 1 wk review,"All good at 1 week old!  It's a 2.5L 4 which is about the biggest 4 out there for most every mfg. (I've not heard of any larger 4. Different manufacturers offer 2.5s, 2.4s, 2.3s on down.) As you read, keep in mind it IS the lowest base fwd 6 speed automatic model,....... 

First, MPG: On this first full tank from dealer I am ~averaging~ 32.3 mpg  ;>), that's approx 65% city, 35% hwy. There are actually three modes: Sport, 'non' sport/regular mode, and ECO. In Sport it really gets out of its own way and as far as I know, ECO light -  which is right between tach and speedo, never comes on. In regular mode, the ECO light will come on when you're light on the gas pedal; goes off when stepping on it. In ECO mode it finds optimal economy shift points for best mpg. It's the 'least powerful' mode. As a test I wanted to see how high I could get the MPGs -- 45mph road I got it to hit 41.7mpg for a minute, haha.
COMFORT: On my base LE fwd -- I'm 6' 1"", would be great if the front seats slide back one or two more 'clicks' but is really ok. No frills on base model, like no lumbar dial even. but seats are comfortable enough. Back seat are plenty roomy for six footers and the seatbacks recline 60/40, and there's a fold armrest w/ 2 cup holders.
FUNCTIONALITY: Very good - Traded a 2010 Ford Explorer (which in itself is a GREAT truck). Though not as large inside of course, the Rav ~hatch opening~  is about 1"" taller [31""  +/-)  my biggie was wanted to fit a regular plastic trash barrel in, standing up - can do! need to remove cover first then once in, put cover back on, or just tilt it in w/cvr.
STYLE: I think it looks great. Many base SUVs do NOT have STANDARD tinted windows (Subaru, Chevy equinox, others, ask or just look before you buy any car.) RAV4 tint is std. I DO miss the separate hatch ~window~ open from the Explorer... it's hatch only on the RAV but no huge deal. More as I drive ;>)"
"05 22, 2017",Awesome!,"Purchased a new 2017 XLE RAV 4 AWD to replace my old 2012 Toyota RAV base model.  I work in sales--lot of miles covered every day!  The new 2017 RAV is awesome...few more bells and whistles than the base model, nice 6 inch led display along with lane departure, enhanced stereo. Ride is very comfortable, and the XLE feels luxurious for a very nice price.  No more Spare Tire on the back--and the newly designed lift gate is great considering I'm vertically challenged.  Cargo space is nice, and it comes with all weather maps-including the cargo area!  Nicely designed, comfy ride for someone on the road all day!  perfect!"
"05 22, 2017",Love this car!,I love almost everything about my 2017 RAV4 XLE. There are a few things I dislike but it's not anything  that I believe toyota could change right now. For instance. My style for some reason doesn't have side mirror defrosters which I think is weird. And mine doesn't have a CD player but o have sirus XM.
"05 21, 2017",Somewhat disappointed.,"I am somewhat disappointed in the 2017 RAV4 I purchased.  I wish I had rented one before I purchased.  The visibility out the back window is not good with the back seat headrests up.  The cover for the back part of the car does not cover the whole back area.  The rear door is very long and almost hits me when I open it. This also happened to my granddaughter who is very tall.  I wish I had gotten the automatic tailgate lift.  There is not very much storage in the doors for maps, umbrellas, etc., only storage for a water bottle.  The top center of the windshield has a black box which is very distracting when you are driving. The car is very comfortable and drives very smoothly.  Wish I could have driven one for a week before I purchased.  The Bluetooth  is difficult for the person I call to hear me."
"05 20, 2017",Fun family car,"Reliable , nice looking from the exterior. Interior is ok. It is good car for the family with plenty of space for the kids stuff."
"05 20, 2017",Love this vehicle.,This is the vehicle I was looking for. I absolutely love it. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance and look of it.

"05 19, 2017",Has all the features I wanted,"It is a sharp-looking vehicle and is ""fully-loaded"" with every feature that will make driving the car easy and fun!!  Had my last Toyota for 14 years and never had any problems---looking now for the same service :)"
"05 18, 2017",Love this car.,"This car run so smoothly and I can barely even hear the engine. I would have love the white color though but gray is not so bad either. Just tge right size for me and my family. I love the smart key system and the Bluetooth. Everything about it, I love."
"05 18, 2017",Very Roomy for a Midsize SUV,"So far very happy with the car. I have 3 medium/large dogs, and all 3 sit in the back without having to put the seats down comfortably. Very Roomy, especially for me since I am 6'3''"
"05 18, 2017",Good Size for the $,It runs well and comfortable with lots of space. I traded in a Prius for more space. The interior is sleek
"05 18, 2017",Toyotas no. one,handles well love the new safety features nice looking love driving it would highly recommend this vehicle this is the 8th Toyota in our household very reliable
"05 18, 2017",Rav4 review,This car meets our needs but I really miss my Toyota Camry. We got the Rav 4 for the all wheel drive but it doesn't have the pick up the Camry has.
"05 17, 2017",wonderful smaller SUV,i am sad to sell such a wonderful car. It is new with 320 miles on it. Lives in a garage waiting a new owner.
"05 17, 2017",My last three cars have been Toyota.  dependable.,"So far it is doing great.  The only thing I am not crazy about is no power seats.  I still can work them but would choose power seats next time.  I have taken it from Ohio to North Carolina without any problems.  It's a Toyota, what else is there to say."
"05 17, 2017",The Best I've ever Driven!,"Everything I looked for in a car, my Rav 4 XLE have it. I love this car. And it drives so smoothly. It even have steering assistance and back up camera. And I just had to have a sunroof."
"05 17, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"It really meets all my needs. It has enough space in the trunk for storage, enough leg space, and I love the fact that it does not consume a lot of gas."
"05 16, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The car handled nicely. We used the abundant storage spaces. The lane monitoring is an excellent safety feature.
The speed mode is an excellent feature.

Thanks"
"05 16, 2017",Nice Ride!,"While I've only had my Rav 4 for a couple of days, I am impressed with the quality of the ride I get from this vehicle.  I upgraded from a Prius, which I loved, but I think I'm falling in love with my new Rav4 for different reasons.  I feel safe and secure, and I have much better visibility than in my old car.  I know I'll have more confidence in snow due to the AWD model I purchase."
"05 16, 2017",excellent car,"I bought a new car recently and i  am excited with my new car RAV4 LE. I like exterior styling comfort, performance of the car. it worth for the money i have paid."
"05 15, 2017",Great experience with Toyota made me return,"I have less than 1K miles on my new vehicle but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed my new RAV4.  My former vehicle was a 2003 Toyota Solara SLE and I just love that car but decided to go with an SUV this time...no regrets!  Love it so far!  If the RAV4 is as reliable as my Solara (after almost 15 years), I will be extremely happy.  My grandson is the lucky recipient of my Solara...hoping he enjoys it as much as I like my new vehicle!"
"05 15, 2017",Great SUV,I traded my '06 RAV 4 which I bought new for a new '17 Rav 4.  I bought the new car based on my experience with the old one which was excellent.  We've had great luck with   all of our Toyota cars and will definitely buy Toyota again.
"05 15, 2017",Its a very nice car for the price.,Its a very nice car for the price. Its very balanced and comfortable and the awd is a very nice feature for the pacific nw .
"05 14, 2017",Excellent Vehicle,"We got the base model LE and it came with great standard safety features including Smart Stop Technology, backup camera, and lane departure alert."
"05 14, 2017",Excited to Own Another Toyota,Love the comfortable ride and looking forward to the better gas mileage! This is my 5th Toyota that I have purchased.
"05 13, 2017",Downsized from Toyota Sienna and love it.,"Love our navigation system, blue tooth, handling, our leather seats, to mention a few. After owning vans for the last 30 plus years, we were wondering if a smaller vehicle would work for us. We just love our new car."
"05 12, 2017",Love the Rav4,"The Rav4 is an excellent vehicle, this being my third one. It is comfortable and reliable especially for long distance."
"05 11, 2017",RAV4 LE no-frills comfort and utility,"My RAV4 LE is a basic model that still provides a reasonably comfortable and quiet ride for an AWD. I did not want to pay for so-called luxury features, and found a great deal during April's $2000 cash back sale. As a senior, I wanted easy access, safety, and reliability which the RAV4 LE provided over other small SUV's."
"05 11, 2017",Love having a Toyota back!,This is a very comfortable and stylish small SUV.  Just slightly more room than a car yet giving you the great car type gas mileage.  Feels great to be back in a Toyota again!!!!
"05 10, 2017",Family Favorite,"It's hard not to love a RAV4...and this year's model is improved over the past with its wider wheelbase, smoother ride and ease of collapsing the back seats. We love its versatility for riding, hauling, and parking. And our local deal gave us an offer we couldn't refuse! We shopped around, but RAV4 was top choice for us."
"05 10, 2017",I feel safe and comfortable,"overall, reliability and comfort are good, looks great..  I wish it got better gas mileage but for the size, not much better out there!"
"05 10, 2017",Liking it!,"I've only had the RAV4 hybrid for 10 days, but I've been happy with everything about it so far.  I've driven a little over 700 miles of city, freeway, mountain highway and back country gravel roads while getting 35.1 MPG.  I really like the feature that detects pedestrians that I might not see otherwise and the feature that keep separation between my vehicle and the one in front of me.  So far, I'm really liking it!"
"05 10, 2017",RAV4 is the best car I've ever owned!,Really made a great  Choice with this Toyota RAV4! It's  Smooth to drive. Very  quiet and has so much space very  roomey. It's has a look of an very  expensive brand on the outside the  design is perfect  and stylish!
"05 10, 2017",Stylish and sleek,The crossover vehicle I just purchased is very modern and hip and totally makes driving enjoyable again.
"05  9, 2017","Sleek, Stylish -- Perfect","I downsized from a 2013 Toyota Sienna (family of 6) to a 2017 Rav4 (seats 5).  Although it's one less seat, I am very happy with it. The interior is very sleek and stylish, the seats are black leather (which many of them come with cloth seats) and very comfortable -- nice back support. The back seats can incline or be laid down for storage. I enjoy all of the safety features. Nice stereo system. I'm starting to feel my age again and not like a ""mom"". Love it!"
"05  9, 2017",Kari Harris,love it and so smooth of a ride. never had a Toyota before and just love it . handles so easy and great on gas and easy to use for shopping and having passengers
"05  7, 2017",Great car for anyone to use.,I love everything about this car. From the features it has like reverse camera and lane sensor to the Bluetooth radio. I love how comfortable it is and how cheap the gas is.
"05  6, 2017",Excellent car,Very impressed with exterior and VERY comfortable ride. Controls and features are easy to use (and figure out ).
"05  6, 2017",technologically smart car for a babyboomer,"We are very pleased with the decision to purchase RAV4 EXL 2017 . The deciding point were the built in safety features, beautiful extetior and roomier interior. My husband us a diehard fan of toyota RAV4. Our previous car was also rav4. The old RAV 4 is still in avery good running condition and we decided to donste it to a charity"
"05  4, 2017",Amazing,It's smooth and runs well. I save money on gas and it's not a hybrid. It's easy to clean and it has many safety features.
"05  4, 2017",2017 RAV4,It is so easy to get into & out of.  The beep from the lane changer is a little surprising especially when I didn't think I was drifting.  Love the auto headlights.  The interior is very user friendly.  Everything is within reach.  There are cup holders & bottle holders.  Still getting used to the backup camera.  I feel very secure in this vehicle.  So nice ti have hands free phone for when I need it.  Great sound system & lots of air bags.
"05  3, 2017",First new car I've  owned,I love the  way it performs  and all the safety features it has. like the front and rear parking sonar
"05  3, 2017",most important decision I have ever made.,"I bought the RAV4. it  is the  most important t decision I have ever made.
it drives very smooth. great value."
"05  2, 2017",Rav4 Platinum,"I purchased this car for a great price! Its comes fully loaded and very stylish! This site helped me get the BEST,  plus I negotiated. Im happy!!"
"05  2, 2017",Offers a smooth ride with great gas mileage,Great family car. Very spacious. The new design is very elegant. Toyota is a very reliable car make and this car really shows why.
"05  1, 2017",Purchased a Rav 4,"Very comfortable, well appointed, very suitable for Upstate NY weather conditions.
Had excellent assistance throughout purchase experience"
"05  1, 2017",Happy Rav driver,"Our family has 4 Toyotas and we have loved them all. This is the first Rav but like all the others, it is a great car."
"05  1, 2017",Not all changes are positive,"I also own a 2010 RAV 4, which I love.  Lots of upgrades with the electronics on the 2017.  The backup camera is nice, the radar guided cruise is a blessing and a curse.  The lane indicator is just annoying.  I like that the spare is inside the car.  I DO NOT like that the rear door is now a hatch rather than a door.  No more closing the door with your hands full.  

The interior seems a bit plasticy/cheap."
"05  1, 2017",Love my RAV4,Haven't bought a car in 17 years and finally not the bullet and bought a New RAV4 and I love it. I look forward to many adventures I'll have with my new RAV4. There is plenty of room to but my bike in the back of the Rav4  without taking the front wheel off. As well as plenty of room for camping gear! Very happy with my purchase!
"04 30, 2017",Toyota is Toyota,"I wanted to buy a car and I was hesitant between Toyota RAV4 , Nissan Rouge, Jeep Cherokee, and I bought Toyota at the end , it is better"
"04 30, 2017",Best engineered car I've ever owned.,My wife and I love this car and often fight over who's going to do the driving..Don't know how reliable it will be but being the owner of a previous  Toyota I'm sure it will be very reliable.
"04 29, 2017",The best SUV,This is the best SUV. This is our 3 car that we purchased and we are so happy with our new car. The car isn't too big that what we wanted to buy. Before buying check the futures for the car
"04 27, 2017",Great SUV,"We had never bought a Toyota before and were pleasantly surprised at all the features for the money. It is an excellent ride, looks stylish, and was a great value for the money. It lacks a little in performance, but gets us where we are going, and saves us fuel costs over the Explorer which we used to drive. We like the 2 year 24 month free maintenance with purchase and are looking forward to many years of care free driving."
"04 26, 2017",Stylish,"Teach W. At the Owings Mills location really worked hard for me to get into my RAV4, She was extremely knowledgeable, patient and caring, about the vehicle. I know I wore her out with questions and she answered every one. Teah W. Made me feel like it was about me and not making a sale. 10 all across the board, thanks a bunch Teah W."
"04 26, 2017",Great car!,"Comfort, convenience and wonderful adaptable technology creates a safe and high performance ride.  I love the galactic agua/black.

"04 26, 2017",I am enjoying the Rav4,It is so much easier to get in and out of.  It is so comfortable  to drive.  I love the color and the ease in driving.  Driving home was great and easy.
"04 25, 2017",Too new to articulate,"I only have about 165 miles on my new RAV4 Ltd. so far but ""so far, so good"" is all I can say.  I have looked at RAV4's for several years and I was finally ready to purchase since I was gifting my Solara to my grandson for college graduation in May.  The reviews in Consumer Reports and from friends that own one was good enough for me to buy one...looking forward to many good years and miles in my RAV4 Ltd."
"04 25, 2017",Love!!,I love the Toyota Rav 4. I originally went in to look at the 2017 Highlander with 3rd row seating. I didn't like it as it seemed hard to get to the back row without the captain chairs. To go to that model it was out of my budget. With the third row seating there wasn't much room to place anything in the back area. So I decided the Rav 4 was a better fit for my needs.
"04 24, 2017",Toyota Rav-4 2017,"Toyota makes the best car i have ever owned, I have TWO Rav-4  1- 2003 and now a 2017"
"04 22, 2017",2017 toyota Rav4 Limited,"Traded a 2014 Rav4 Limited for the additional TSS-P safety features on the 2017 version.  Really love the radar cruise control, and the additional insulation to quiet the ride! Still disappointed that leather interior is not offered."
"04 22, 2017",Our new Rav/4,"The Rav/4 has all the features we were looking for in a new SUV.   The standard safety features, such as lane departure and distance to obstacles/vehicles directly in front of you will prove to be valuable.   I especially like the eco mode that works to save fuel.   We've only owned for a couple days, but we are certain we will continue to love it"
"04 22, 2017",Have owned many Toyotas.,"This is the 7th Toyota I have bought new. 
I have always been very satisfied with them & my 2017 Rave 4 XLE is no exception. Superior quality.



























this is"
"04 22, 2017",Awsome inside and out,We bought our RAV 4 for many reasons after comparing it to other similar sized SUVs. We loved the feel and handling of it on the road. The interior offered comfortable seating and lots of leg room in back seat as well as front. They had wonderful colors to choose frm and the exterior style was attractive. Also the safety technology was amazing.
"04 22, 2017",Happiness,Love the color and the way it drives.  I feel very safe and secure in the car because I am sitting up high and can see
"04 21, 2017",I love my new Rav4!,"Toyotas are amazing and the Rav4 is no exception. Even Honda Laura on Youtube found the Rav4 to be sleek, comfortable, and well-designed in comparison to the Honda CRV. I personally find the both the exterior and interior design of the Rav4 to be better than the CRV. I own the SE model and I am glad I waited for that design (rather than the LE). It has many added features. This is the best car I have ever owned!"
"04 21, 2017",Another great Toyota,We love our Toyotas & look forward to driving our current reliable Toyotas & purchasing more Toyotas in the future.
"04 21, 2017",Rav 4 is awesome,"Great handling, comfortable, affordable, reliable.   Great in snow too!  

I have had four Ravs. I just helped my mother purchase her first one."
"04 21, 2017",Third RAV4,While I have had my new 2017 Toyota RAV4 for only a very short period of time I am extremely impressed with it.  This is the 3rd new RAV4 that I have purchased and find this new one as the very best.  Of course it is my first Hybrid model but the Safety package is outstanding.  The added horse power provides quick acceleration and the ride is much softer than previous RAV4's that I have owned.  The cabin is quiet offering a very pleasant interior environment for conversation or listening to the radio.  I have already advised several friends to consider exploring purchasing a 2017 RAV4.
"04 21, 2017",2017 RAV4 good buy,"great value for the money, like all the new safety features that were made standard, solid built car."
"04 20, 2017",Rav/REVs,"Things were going great until I had some tire issues only a week into leasing this car.
Other than than, gas mileage great for such a big car, it feels very safe, I like being a bit higher than a sedan but not too much, more room for my kids and dog in the back!"
"04 19, 2017",dash clock,"can anyone tell me how to set the instrument clock ??
its one pain in the BUTT.. even the sales manager could not say how to get it off army time 
CAN Anyone HELP 
Thanks John Zeman"
"04 15, 2017",Excellant Value and Safety!,I'm am very impressed with the Rav4. Excellent safety features standard and a great value for your money. This is my first Toyota and I am very surprised how much I love this vehicle. I have owned many makes in the past and this is by far one of my favorites. Its a great ride the safety features like lane departure are great they alert you but are not annoying like other makers alerts. The back up camera is easier for me to understand than other cars I have had. So impressed!
"04 14, 2017",Mrs. & Mrs.,"Outstanding experience!  All employees at the Braintree Dealership were extremely professional and helpful.  Would highly recommend - very pleasant non-stressful
experience."
"04 14, 2017",Robert Simms,Just bought car on 4-12-2017 havent owned it long enough to comment on its reliabilty but I fully expect it to be great....real nice car. Had to give it a rating to submit.
"04 13, 2017",sharp,everybody should experience a rav4
"04 13, 2017",Love the vehicle,"Only negatives are with the interior. Wish there had been more of a choice of fabric color.
Also, need more room for small incidentals, like the Camry has..."
"04 12, 2017",Most reliable car,Good decision I have made about selecting car and dealers sbip good salesperson Sunil I me at Brandon toyota
"04 11, 2017",Great New Car,"After having my Jeep for almost 8 years, it was finally time for a new car. I had been looking for a while and fell in love with the RAV4. So far it has been an amazing car. I love the features from the backup camera, lane detection, and the great gas mileage for an SUV. Could not have picked a better, more stylish new ride."
"04 10, 2017",Very well equipped car,"I am impressed by the fact that Toyota cares enough of its customers to provide them with all safety features as a standard, rather than reserve those features for only the high-priced models"
"04  9, 2017",Good ride,Love the hatchback touch opener & sun roof design
"04  8, 2017",Getting used to a new car,Had Toyota's in he past. Changed to Ford . Now back to Toyota. I like it. We also have a 2005 Toyota Solara Convertible. It is the nicest convertible on the street. We are sorry that Toyota stopped making them. I'm sure we would have bought another Solara convertible
"04  7, 2017",Pretty car,First computer car We have owned!Like the black interior &the white outside color combination. First new car. We have had in a long time
"04  6, 2017",my 4th Toyota,"perfect size for me, handles great and good gas mileage"
"04  6, 2017",Toyota Rav4,"I purchased a new Toyota Rav4 from Mr.David Ho, he is great business person and he explained to my and my wife everything about our investment and we understood everything,  we would like to say thank you to  Mr  David Ho and we rating  him with  (A+)"
"04  5, 2017",2017 RAV 4,Just upgraded from a 2013 RAV 4.  The\is the best car that I've owned! The forward visibility is beyond compare!  I love the standard safety features that Toyota has installed in this vehicle.
"04  4, 2017",BEST car I ever owned,"I highly recommend the Toyota Rav4. Especially with all the great new safety features. Safe, fun to drive and looks like a million bucks! I love it :)"
"04  4, 2017",I love my rav4,"Great car , very happy with all the options it comes with. The ability to be awd unless 50/50 4wd is needed is a great attribute"
"04  3, 2017",PERFECT!,"Couldn't be happier with vehicle.  Handles better than expected.  Very solid vehicle and ride is SWEET!!!  Bigger inside than I thought and the 2017 style is beyond expectations.  Glad I gave it a chance and it is just the perfect purchase for me. BEST overall purchase experience to date!  Paul Costouros was very thorough, patient and above all very  knowledgeable with all aspects of the process.  The process was seamless and smooth as silk from start to finish.  Jack Prato was great with explaining the financing process and I was in and out in no time.  I received an excellent deal for my new vehicle and very pleased that I took my friends advice to go see Paul at Bredemann Toyota for my new purchase.  Forget the rest...I FOUND THE BEST!!!  I am looking forward to my new dealership relationship and couldn't be happier with my purchase and being a part of the Bredemann Family."
"04  1, 2017",Can't wait to drive it more,"first Toyota and can't wait to drive it
heard lots of good comments, reviews about the brand
comfortable and good price"
"04  1, 2017",Love it!,"Great smooth ride, trust it to get me through the snow, love the look of it. Love the back up camera and that I can connect my phone via Bluetooth through the radio. And a moonroof- perfect!"
"03 31, 2017",2017 Rav 4,Very nice car and with the new security features it worth every dollar. I love it and my family too. I recommend this car with no doubt
"03 30, 2017",Toyota Rav4,Very smooth to handle and comfortable in all aspects.. powerful and good handling. I liked interior design very much.
"03 29, 2017","Excellent, comfortable and with the technology","Before buying a car I always see the Reviews, but when driving I reaffirm a comfortable car, hard body, good power and above all highly efficient in consumption."
"03 28, 2017",Owner,This is the second Rav4 my family has purchased and we love it.  I do wish there were more cup  holders
"03 27, 2017",The Car Of The Future,I love my new Rav4. I wish it still came in a V6. But overall I love everything about it and the new body shape. I am very impress with all the bells and whistles this car has.
"03 26, 2017",Rav4 is a beautiful vehicle,We last owned a Rav three years ago.  The changes made to the design and safety wowed us.  Such a classy looking vehicle.
"03 26, 2017","A Real Gem in Style, Safety and Comfort","I just purchased a Toyota RAV4 SE and couldn't be happier. The safety features  and solid feel are excellent. The comfort and performance are also fantastic! You really feel you are driving a super high end car in all aspects. To be honest there are 3 things that I was disappointed with--my car had the Entunes Connected GPS Navigation System.  Very much a let down in what you would expect- no way to get a map showing as you drove or even when getting directions. You got arrows and voice but no map. Also, no way to get the Entune apps promoted and showing. I called Entunes, Toyota, the GPS company and they all said those things not able to work in this model navigation system plus, you cannot install the Premium Entunes system to replace the connected one as hardware not included. The map was important to me, so I had to go to outside vendor and have a brand name navigation system installed. The second feature, no integration of garage door opener into the car in any way. I have to carry my opener with me. The outside vendor said they possibly could add something for several hundred dollars but after the navigation change out, definitely could not justify spending hundreds more just to not carry my garage door opener. The 3rd things, the splash up is atrocious. My car is white and after driving a few miles in rainy weather, the top surface of the back bumper was black, along with the entire rear liftgate and window, coated in mud film.  I had mud flaps installed by the dealer and happy to say--excellent value for the money, the rear of the Rav stays clean now. They look sharp and are a solid addition.  I also had the side mouldings put on, good additional protection and really improves the appearance of the vehicle. After those modifications, I feel I am driving a top car in comfort, safety, appearance and reliability.  As far as safety features, Toyota now equips their Ravs with just about everything you could think of and it works so well.  This car is luxury in safety features, comfort, reliability and appearance. Still have a constant smile on my face as I drive it. One other things, Toyota now has as standard the type of shifting system that cars like the Prius have had before, the anticipated shifting where you don't even feel the car shift, leads to much better fuel consumption, better ride and performance and more steady acceleration when you need to increase your speed, like when entering a freeway.  By the way, if you happen to be in the Oregon area, a dealer in Hillsboro, Royal Moore Toyota, no personal connection, has a unique 20,000 mile Power Train Warranty, along with making a car buying experience  so enjoyable and one in which you end up with friends, in every department. The personal care and recognition from your first day on is exceptional!"
"03 26, 2017",Great vehicle,"I have owned this vehicle for about 2 months and miss some of the features on my previous vehicle, but am overall well pleased with it.  Love the blind sport mirrors, lane beepers, and the automatic slowing feature while in cruise control"

"03 25, 2017",Great Car!,"The Toyota RAV4 is a really fun car to drive, and it's loaded with safety features!  It's all wheel drive SUV, which is nice because you sit higher than a car.  It's a good car to drive in the winter because of its traction with the all wheel drive.  It handles really well, too.  I highly recommend it!"

"03 24, 2017",Awesome car for student driver...,We picked this car for a new driver in the household.  we really liked all the safety features it offers and makes us feel a bit better about letting them drive on their own.  The safety features was definitely the selling point.

"03 20, 2017",Seek to have this be a terrific vehicle.,Looking forward to a wonderful experience. It is a new SUV for us & we are anxious to have fun & pleasure with it.
"03 20, 2017",HAPPY WITH MY TOYOTA RAV4 2017,"LOVELY AN ECONOMY CAR, THE PEOPLE FROM THIS DEALER SI SO NICE AND HELPFUL!
Y RECOMMEND 100% PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS DEALER"
"03 19, 2017",Its my 3rdd Rav so you can see I love it.,"My only complaint was I can't reach the rear hatch back to close it, should of got an automatic closer. Wasn't aware I would be too short."
"03 19, 2017",2017 Rav4,"The only thing Toyota got wrong on this model is the alignment of the sunvisor & rearview mirror. You can't lower the visor & then push it forward & up to block sun, but maintain visibilty. This is due to the visor hitting the rearview mirror. A pain for taller people like me!"
"03 19, 2017",Great 2017 RAV 4,"This is my 2nd RAV4, I also owned a 2010, they are a very reliable vehicle. They are very comfortable and fun to drive."
"03 16, 2017",Great car,"I've only had the vehicle a week, but I love it! Handles well, gets great gas mileage. I only wish the passenger seat had electric adjustments, instead of manual."
"03 14, 2017","Excellent, reliable vehicle!","Very pleased with this vehicle. Everything about it is absolutely great! I'm looking forward to 4 wheel drive, especially with recent weather. Overall very satisfied!!!"
"03 14, 2017",Amazing vehicle,Not one single complaint! I am beyond happy about my vehicle and can't wait to continue driving it for years to come!
"03 14, 2017",Loving my car,Was very happy with the comfort and ease if driving this car. And thank goodness for the all wheel drive during this march snow
"03 13, 2017",Most impressive SUV I have had the pleasure of dri,The RAV4 surpassed the expectations I had for this small SUV. I was expecting something good and was really impressed with what I received.
"03 12, 2017",Rav 4 -- the second one we've owned.,"Very nice car. Good gas mileage.  This is our second Rav 4. Traded in a 2013 for the Platinum series .  It has many of the same features you would find on the Highlander, but is a bit smaller with better gas mileage. The foot sweep to open the rear hatch is great. And the heated steering wheel is a welcomed feature living in Wisconsin. Could have a little smoother ride, but overall great."
"03 12, 2017",Platinum Trim Level Rocks!,"Well, we have one reasonably long trip and 1000 miles on it, and thought it was time to provide at least the initial impressions.  Let me begin by saying I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage (approx. 27mpg on the trip and about 22mpg locally) but that from a perspective of a Prius owner that is used to getting 50+mpg, so temper that.  To go along with that, the engine is just a little anemic; I wish there had been a larger 4 cyl or a small 6 cyl engine.  The seats are firm (and we both love the Sof-Tex in lieu of leather), providing what both my wife and I feel is excellent support, and the car is relatively firmly sprung, at least by the standards of a Prius.  It felt truly excellent on the 500+ mile trip.  There are amenities galore and safety features that I have just begun to explore.  I will write a follow-up review further down the road when I have more miles on it and more understanding of what everything does.  So far, it is an excellent, comfortable automobile, and we both have fallen in love with its ride and its comfort.  I must say, having never had one, the heated steering wheel rocks!"
"03 10, 2017","Reliable, Great safety features","Had a 2014, but the new safety features pushed me into trading for a new one. The adaptive Cruise Control is great and the lane assist."
"03  6, 2017",You Can't Beat the Reliability & Style for the $$,"I come from a high-performance car family (Porsche, Triumph, Jaguars, Vipers, etc) and to me, this is the best looking,  best performing SUV on the market. I've had two Rav4s previously and will never settle for anything else when it comes to buying an SUV."
"03  2, 2017",RAV4 - second one even better than the first,I traded a 2009 Toyota RAV4 in for a 2017 RAV4 and live my new car. Drives so smooth and for a 4 cylinder it had plenty of get up and go.  Very smooth ride even over constructions area rough rodes.  Hope to keep this one for another 125K miles.
"02 27, 2017",Great Car,Perfect vehicle for someone who needs a small SUV loaded up with all the tech and safety features. Gas mileage is great and my dealer experience was superb
"02 22, 2017",paper work,"got a 2017 rav 4 xle and it did not even have compass.over $30,000 and no compass.Had to pay over $300 to get one. How sad is that??"
"01 27, 2017",A very good car I love it.,My sales person Ricardo Tuazon at Rte 440 Hudson Toyota Jersey City NJ.  He's very knowledgeable and  provides good suggestion in getting a new car. I will recommend him to my friends and other relatives.
"01 26, 2017",Best buying experience ever,"The two toned interior leather is amazing looking. Dealer I purchase from is Big Two Toyota. My sales rep was ""Griz"" Griffin. This was my most pleasant purchase of a new car ever. I'm 67. I've purchased 5 new cars. This dealership and honest retail experience was awesome!"
"01  9, 2017",One disappointment,"This is our seconD RAV 4, had a2011 and have a 2014 both new. Biggest probem w have had is the rough ride, they have no suspension for rough roads.  Hit a bump and you feel like you have bottomed out. Need to smooth out the suspension and have a replacement kit to fixit."
"11 29, 2016",Happy Customers,"In April of 2016 we purchase a Toyota Rav4, with the help of salesman Tom Vosnos.  We loved the new Rav4, so when we needed a second car, we went back to Bredemann Toyota and purchase a second Rav4 (2017) with Tom's help.  We are very happy with both vehicles.  Great car, great service."
"11  2, 2016",The RAV4 is a good vehicle.,"A friend and I each bought a RAV4. Overall it is a good vehicle. However, the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've experienced."

"07  6, 2017",Smart Investment,"I love my new Rav 4. The safety features alone and the peace of mind this gives me. I bought this car for my wife and my two 5 year old twins. I feel much better when They are out and about. The design is great. With all the great electronic features this car has. 2 small improvements I would suggest, power seats would be awesome. And when the car is sold update the navigation system before handing off to the buyer. Or include a map update in the sales package."
"07  5, 2017",Loving it!!!!,"I absolutely love it! Roomy, stylish, comfortable,  and great gas mileage.  I love all the safety features and how smooth of a ride it is. Lots of storage space too!!!"

My Daughter wants one now!"
"07  2, 2017","So exceptional, I bought another one!","My RAV4 is exactly what everyone would want in a small SUV. The look is just sporty enough, but provides the ultimate in safety and handling. The size fits me, as I can slide right in and the controls are so accessible. The Rav4's performance and reliability are what gives it the added appeal. When I compared the Rav 4 to other models, it ranked far above the rest. Throughly pleased with my purchase!"
"07  1, 2017",Names say for all.,"Toyota being a leader in manufacturing of great cars. The reliability is unbeaten by anyone in today's market, being said that their car in long run worth every penny you have send on. 

Toyota as I have owned have given me what I want and truly have great models and safety features, as most of the other have started to provide one after they interduced in 2017."

"06 27, 2017",Rav it up,"I love my new Rav4 Limited edition. I still find myself looking for places to go so I can ride around in it. I previously owned a Toyota Camry and until the day I sold it ( to a co-worker who knew what a great car it was and what good care it had ) and said good by. Even after I bought an Acura I kept the Camry for awhile, I had a hard time parting with it. I`m already attached to my new Rav4. It rides so nice, seating is very comfy and ample. I love the safety features, I`m all for safety and prevention. It has too many great features to get into.......just take one for a drive and you will see. Toyota makes great products that are reliable, made roomy and comfortable and they have style and class. I am sooo ready for a rode trip with my new Rav4."
"06 26, 2017","Love, love, love my car!","I just love my car.  It is by far one of the most comfortable vehicles I've ever been in.   By far, it is the best car I've ever driven.  Its' seats are extremely comfortable. I really like the design of the dash board.  It just seems to me that everything is in the right place.  The car handless like a dream.  You really should test drive one.  You'll love it!"
"06 24, 2017",my third Rav 4....bulletproof,"Solid, dependable vehicle. A bit underpowered, but has enough power to get the job done. New design is sharp. Attractive inside and out."
"06 24, 2017",Very reliable.,I am very satisfied with my choice. It's my first Toyota and I love it. I know it will serve its purpose.
"06 24, 2017",Great vehicle,"My new Rav 4 is great and very stylish.  I owned another Rav 4 for 11 years and when I traded her in, I knew that I wanted the same make of vehicle."
"06 24, 2017",Our 3rd RAV4! Never buy anything else!!,"We love the RAV4. We just keep buying another. We kept the last one for over 10 years and even then couldn't decide if we should trade for the newer one. There's room for the dogs (German Shepherd, Springer Spaniel) and all the luggage you could ever want to carry. It's never had trouble passing a car or avoiding a problem THEY ARE GREAT!!!"
"06 23, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The safety features such as BSM and forward radar are great. 

We drove the new car 2000 miles to Disney World and it handled great on the highway.

My wife likes the extra visibility that the car offers."
"06 22, 2017",Awesome car!,"The rav 4 is a great car overall, comfortable, sleek style exterior, interior is functional, plenty of space in the back seats for kids and adults! The trunk has great space capacity. A great family car, would highly recommend it!"
"06 22, 2017",Awesome vehicle,"Comfortable, great pick up for a 4 cylinder.   Style is and out is fantastic.  Very roomy.  Lots of extras that come standard."
"06 21, 2017",Worst SUV,"This is a silk purse made from a pigs skin, in other words appearances are deceiving. Very very very thin sheet metal on the main body, engine knock at 800 miles, gas mileage is distorted..gets about 20 city 24 highway normal driving with I passenger. Not capable or worthy of a maintoned gravel road and I would not recommend ever leaving pavement . Seat material is flimsy, dash parts cheap plastic, carpeting is like paper material....."
"06 21, 2017","Excellent ride, handling and economy","Vehicle fills our needs exactly. Handles great, drives well, parks easily and is comfortable.  Great values for the purchase price."
"06 21, 2017",Knew the minute I sat in the driver seat...,"That this vehicle was for me. This is a fun little SUV with tons of safety features. I've got the Limited and am so happy I jumped up my budget for all the extras. The controls are user-friendly, the drivers seat exceptionally comfortable and the ride surprisingly smooth. Kudos to Toyota for a bold new color as well. Black Currant is just plain pretty."
"06 20, 2017",Like it,"Drove the rav4and really like it liked the color  the leather seats the salesman was great and the people, the salesman explained all teachers. .left jasper with a full tank of gas any happy"
"06 19, 2017",Toyota,"I love my New Rav4! It is so comfortable. The dash is so easy to see everything and reach. Having the back up camera and the peeps, if someone is walking behind is awesome. Also with my arms full of packages to be able to wave my foot under the car and my back door opens. The blind spot monitors are a great help. I can park and push a button and see if my car is parked correctley.Handles great on side roads and the freeway. Has a lot of pick up. Nice smooth ride. Will have my Rav4 for a long time!"
"06 18, 2017",Very dependable and comfortable,"I love the comfort and ease of use, all instruments work smoothly.  Very stylish and due to our winters, I am grateful that all wheel drive comes with this model.  Very nice.  Salesperson Miranda M made the whole experience very quick and comfortable."
"06 18, 2017",Very nice care for you money!,"Toyota as we all know are very reliable.
The new Rav4 is very aggressive-looking and sporty on the inside as well. The four cylinder is very reliable not as powerful as some would hope but it still gets the job done. very roomy inside the rear seats recline just like the front. The JBL sound system is amazing. For the price you can't go wrong with the RAV4 test drive one today."
"06 16, 2017",Most sleek car I own,"The color of exterior and interior is what I really wanted.  Economical and dependable. Good legroom, and I got all the features I wanted for a new car."
"06 15, 2017",No problems at all,"Our previous car was a Toyota Camry that was the most reliable car we have ever owned even after 192,000 miles. But even the Camry had to be taken back to the shop a couple times for the first thousand miles or so to fix some initial problems. The RAV4 has had absolutely no problems at all. It appears to be a highly refined design. It is a pleasure to drive. It is probably the last car we will ever own since I am now 75 years old."
"06 12, 2017",Love my new Toyota - totally reliable,The comfort is excellent - awesome suspension which I know I can count on this vehicle to travel not only for commuting but for visiting out of town.
"06 12, 2017",Safest Car on the Road!,"Previous to my leasing my 2017 Rav4 this past weekend, I drove a 2010 Mazda Tribute.  Having bought my lease out 2 years ago, I have been shopping around for the next vehicle to lease.  I knew I wanted a smaller SUV similar to the size of the Tribute, but was looking for safety, reliability, and backseat legroom.  I currently drive for both of my elderly parents and was concerned about their ability to get in and be comfortable in the backseat and have room for walkers, etc.  I am ULTRA IMPRESSED about the safety rating of the Rav4.  I am way passed wanting to impress anyone with my car, but I can say after just 4 days I LOVE my Rav4.  I actually had the opportunity to drive a Rav4 back in 2008 when my car was stolen and was in the shop for repair after recovery.  I drove the rental for a little more than a month and it was what really sparked my interest in the car.  I actually liked the way the tailgate opened then as it is more user friendly for women, but understand the concept of the tailgate lifting open as well.  Since that time, it was always on my radar if the opportunity presented itself."
"06  7, 2017",Love my new car -,"Love the comfort and convenience of my new RAV 4 and Karl Malone Toyota has been great to work with and take care of me and my questions. Of course, I have only had it for two weeks - hope it keeps performing so great!"
"06  6, 2017","I have always loved the Rav, now it is even better",I love this car. It is just as fancy and stylish as a Lexus without the price. I would choose a Toyota every time. I have owned 3 Rav-4.
"06  5, 2017",Great Car for the money. Good value.,Good size SUV.  Handles great on the road.  Great with getting in and out of traffic and parking. Feels sturdy.
"06  5, 2017",Best of the Non Luxury two row SUV's,"We test drove most of the competitive models. We found the RAV4 the best bang for the buck. We got the XLE with convenience package that includes push button start, power lift gate and nav. Rides nicely for a small SUV and the seats are comfortable. Good leg room in the back. We don't  intend to drag race so the 0-60 will do."
"06  3, 2017",2017 Rav4 LE,"We decided on this vehicle for several reasons . The size is perfect for us even as a primary vehicle. We had owned Toyotas before and knew of their reliability and we looking for a smaller vehicle with better fuel milage than the one we had. Even though the LE model is a base model it is equipped with more features than we were expecting, exactly what we were looking for. After 1200 miles we are averaging 26 mpg city, 31 hwy. and 28 over all. We bought this one off the dealers lot but had we ordered we would have ordered the exact same model. Very pleased !!!!!"
"06  2, 2017",My new car I love it,"Everything I wanted  in my new car Moonroof Power Hatch alloy Wheels  blootooth

"06  1, 2017",My first Suv,I love it  and absolutely love it. I've wanted this car for a very long time and finally have it. Very smooth drive and roomy.
"05 31, 2017",Shockingly amazing,"I wanted a car with bigger engine but this size. Left me looking at jeep Cherokee but the bigger engine drove poorly, had a 2012 Tucson and it was sluggish and slow but with a similar size engine this car is great to drive and comfortable. Was looking at Infiniti qx30 also and the RAV4 had more features than the Infiniti."
"05 31, 2017",LOVE THIS CAR!,"Drives great!  I feel safe in this vehicle.  The safety features are awesome, and the ride is very smooth."
"05 31, 2017",Better that I ever had,"For family this is the best deal, economy in gas, very quiet, a lot of safety features in the new Rav4."
"05 31, 2017",happyrav4owner,"LOVE.  LOVE.  LOVE.  Everything about this vehicle.  Size is great, gas mileage is good and has all the bells and whistles I wanted!!!"
"05 31, 2017",This is the second RAV 4 we own.,Gives us us everything we need in a car.  Like how it handles and the service is excellent and we liked it so well this is the second RAV 4 we now own.
"05 31, 2017","So far, I love this car.  I only had it 2 weeks...",So far I love this car.  Only have had it for 2 weeks and still learning all the good about it.    I love the open space inside.  Feels great on the road.  I appreciate the beeps when I cross the white or yellow line.. It's a reminder.
"05 30, 2017",Love it!,Very spacious. Really easy to use for someone that's not good with technology. Would recommend it to anyone!
"05 29, 2017",outstanding vehicle,"meets all our needs.Car has many safety items,gets great gas milage,feels  secure on road and is fun to drive."
"05 29, 2017",Fantastic Car,I bought this car about 3 weeks ago.  I had a Camrey and loved it.  This car is large inside with plenty of room to spread out and take a long trip.  The car is very comfortable to ride and drive.  This car can pick up speed quickly in the sport mode and pass cars with ease. It is easy to drive and drives smoothly.
"05 28, 2017",Perfect cat,Great car. Lots of safety features and rides as good as any high dollar car. You will not be sorry if you buy This car.
"05 28, 2017",Great small SUV.,"The RAV4 we purchased is an XLE. It is stylish as well as functional. The Infotainment system keeps you aware of how your car is performing, as well as entertains you. In Sport Mode, the steering is a bit tighter and the pick-up is a bit quicker, which makes merging onto highways easier. I find I usually drive in the ""normal"" mode, which automatically switches to eco mode as you drive, especially when in traffic. It is a fantastic little SUV which has great cargo space for groceries, as well as hauling the usual stuff a family will take with them. Thankfully, my kids are all grown, but for a family with growing kids, it would be great as you have four doors to access the back seats (which have child safety locks), and the ""trunk"" space is ample for carrying the usual child related items. My husband put all of his metal detecting hardware in the trunk and had space left over to put my stuff. I look forward to having this vehicle for the next 10+ years, as I have no doubt it will last that long, even with my 100 mile per day commute to work. I foresee this being an incredible purchase. Toyota has a great reputation for vehicles lasting a long time. My 2002 Sienna served me well until someone hit it in the rear at 60 mph when traffic stopped. It was hard enough to fold it in half. That was in  2008. It gave me absolutely no problems in 6 years. I will bet this RAV4 will do the same. Great vehicle, great deals right now."
"05 27, 2017",Dependable with a Capital B,The RAV-4 is a quiet ride. I like how it gives the option for the engine to give me the option to either use money saving economy miles or give me power when I need it. The standard feature of blue tooth lets me make or receive phone calls just by pushing a button without taking my hands off the steering wheel. I like being able to sit and have a higher view of the road. It maneuvers easily and is able to take sharp turns in residential areas. I feel like I can go anywhere without having something breaking down and can't wait to take it on a long road trip.
"05 27, 2017",Very confortable,"Right fit for me and my family , great size for the family of 4 , enough space , comfortable, easy to navigate, great value"
"05 27, 2017",Most reliable,This car has more legroom trank has more space my children put their bayke in the trank this car more comfortable for driving

"05 25, 2017",Very stylish and sleek interior.,Wanted a vehicle that was easy to get in and out off.  Plus I wanted to be able to pull a small utility trailer.
"05 24, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"The vehicle is comfortable, dependable, and the right size.  The seats adjust for shorter people, making it easier to see the road.  It handles well."
"05 24, 2017",Really Cool Multipurpose vehicle.,"The Rav 4 is pretty cool for a SUV, we've fought long & hard against having one, but in the end we had to give in due to needs. The Rav is small, yet big enough to meet the needs we have as a family. It drives like a car, which isn't something you'll experience in most SUV's"
"05 23, 2017",Reliable and safe vehicle,"Love this car, it is large enough for my needs, but not as large as my former vehicle, gets great gas mileage and has lots of safety features which were very important to me."
"05 23, 2017",LE front drive 2017 1 wk review,"All good at 1 week old!  It's a 2.5L 4 which is about the biggest 4 out there for most every mfg. (I've not heard of any larger 4. Different manufacturers offer 2.5s, 2.4s, 2.3s on down.) As you read, keep in mind it IS the lowest base fwd 6 speed automatic model,....... 

First, MPG: On this first full tank from dealer I am ~averaging~ 32.3 mpg  ;>), that's approx 65% city, 35% hwy. There are actually three modes: Sport, 'non' sport/regular mode, and ECO. In Sport it really gets out of its own way and as far as I know, ECO light -  which is right between tach and speedo, never comes on. In regular mode, the ECO light will come on when you're light on the gas pedal; goes off when stepping on it. In ECO mode it finds optimal economy shift points for best mpg. It's the 'least powerful' mode. As a test I wanted to see how high I could get the MPGs -- 45mph road I got it to hit 41.7mpg for a minute, haha.
COMFORT: On my base LE fwd -- I'm 6' 1"", would be great if the front seats slide back one or two more 'clicks' but is really ok. No frills on base model, like no lumbar dial even. but seats are comfortable enough. Back seat are plenty roomy for six footers and the seatbacks recline 60/40, and there's a fold armrest w/ 2 cup holders.
FUNCTIONALITY: Very good - Traded a 2010 Ford Explorer (which in itself is a GREAT truck). Though not as large inside of course, the Rav ~hatch opening~  is about 1"" taller [31""  +/-)  my biggie was wanted to fit a regular plastic trash barrel in, standing up - can do! need to remove cover first then once in, put cover back on, or just tilt it in w/cvr.
STYLE: I think it looks great. Many base SUVs do NOT have STANDARD tinted windows (Subaru, Chevy equinox, others, ask or just look before you buy any car.) RAV4 tint is std. I DO miss the separate hatch ~window~ open from the Explorer... it's hatch only on the RAV but no huge deal. More as I drive ;>)"
"05 22, 2017",Awesome!,"Purchased a new 2017 XLE RAV 4 AWD to replace my old 2012 Toyota RAV base model.  I work in sales--lot of miles covered every day!  The new 2017 RAV is awesome...few more bells and whistles than the base model, nice 6 inch led display along with lane departure, enhanced stereo. Ride is very comfortable, and the XLE feels luxurious for a very nice price.  No more Spare Tire on the back--and the newly designed lift gate is great considering I'm vertically challenged.  Cargo space is nice, and it comes with all weather maps-including the cargo area!  Nicely designed, comfy ride for someone on the road all day!  perfect!"
"05 22, 2017",Love this car!,I love almost everything about my 2017 RAV4 XLE. There are a few things I dislike but it's not anything  that I believe toyota could change right now. For instance. My style for some reason doesn't have side mirror defrosters which I think is weird. And mine doesn't have a CD player but o have sirus XM.
"05 21, 2017",Somewhat disappointed.,"I am somewhat disappointed in the 2017 RAV4 I purchased.  I wish I had rented one before I purchased.  The visibility out the back window is not good with the back seat headrests up.  The cover for the back part of the car does not cover the whole back area.  The rear door is very long and almost hits me when I open it. This also happened to my granddaughter who is very tall.  I wish I had gotten the automatic tailgate lift.  There is not very much storage in the doors for maps, umbrellas, etc., only storage for a water bottle.  The top center of the windshield has a black box which is very distracting when you are driving. The car is very comfortable and drives very smoothly.  Wish I could have driven one for a week before I purchased.  The Bluetooth  is difficult for the person I call to hear me."
"05 20, 2017",Fun family car,"Reliable , nice looking from the exterior. Interior is ok. It is good car for the family with plenty of space for the kids stuff."
"05 20, 2017",Love this vehicle.,This is the vehicle I was looking for. I absolutely love it. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance and look of it.

"05 19, 2017",Has all the features I wanted,"It is a sharp-looking vehicle and is ""fully-loaded"" with every feature that will make driving the car easy and fun!!  Had my last Toyota for 14 years and never had any problems---looking now for the same service :)"
"05 18, 2017",Love this car.,"This car run so smoothly and I can barely even hear the engine. I would have love the white color though but gray is not so bad either. Just tge right size for me and my family. I love the smart key system and the Bluetooth. Everything about it, I love."
"05 18, 2017",Very Roomy for a Midsize SUV,"So far very happy with the car. I have 3 medium/large dogs, and all 3 sit in the back without having to put the seats down comfortably. Very Roomy, especially for me since I am 6'3''"
"05 18, 2017",Good Size for the $,It runs well and comfortable with lots of space. I traded in a Prius for more space. The interior is sleek
"05 18, 2017",Toyotas no. one,handles well love the new safety features nice looking love driving it would highly recommend this vehicle this is the 8th Toyota in our household very reliable
"05 18, 2017",Rav4 review,This car meets our needs but I really miss my Toyota Camry. We got the Rav 4 for the all wheel drive but it doesn't have the pick up the Camry has.
"05 17, 2017",wonderful smaller SUV,i am sad to sell such a wonderful car. It is new with 320 miles on it. Lives in a garage waiting a new owner.
"05 17, 2017",My last three cars have been Toyota.  dependable.,"So far it is doing great.  The only thing I am not crazy about is no power seats.  I still can work them but would choose power seats next time.  I have taken it from Ohio to North Carolina without any problems.  It's a Toyota, what else is there to say."
"05 17, 2017",The Best I've ever Driven!,"Everything I looked for in a car, my Rav 4 XLE have it. I love this car. And it drives so smoothly. It even have steering assistance and back up camera. And I just had to have a sunroof."
"05 17, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"It really meets all my needs. It has enough space in the trunk for storage, enough leg space, and I love the fact that it does not consume a lot of gas."
"05 16, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The car handled nicely. We used the abundant storage spaces. The lane monitoring is an excellent safety feature.
The speed mode is an excellent feature.

Thanks"
"05 16, 2017",Nice Ride!,"While I've only had my Rav 4 for a couple of days, I am impressed with the quality of the ride I get from this vehicle.  I upgraded from a Prius, which I loved, but I think I'm falling in love with my new Rav4 for different reasons.  I feel safe and secure, and I have much better visibility than in my old car.  I know I'll have more confidence in snow due to the AWD model I purchase."
"05 16, 2017",excellent car,"I bought a new car recently and i  am excited with my new car RAV4 LE. I like exterior styling comfort, performance of the car. it worth for the money i have paid."
"05 15, 2017",Great experience with Toyota made me return,"I have less than 1K miles on my new vehicle but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed my new RAV4.  My former vehicle was a 2003 Toyota Solara SLE and I just love that car but decided to go with an SUV this time...no regrets!  Love it so far!  If the RAV4 is as reliable as my Solara (after almost 15 years), I will be extremely happy.  My grandson is the lucky recipient of my Solara...hoping he enjoys it as much as I like my new vehicle!"
"05 15, 2017",Great SUV,I traded my '06 RAV 4 which I bought new for a new '17 Rav 4.  I bought the new car based on my experience with the old one which was excellent.  We've had great luck with   all of our Toyota cars and will definitely buy Toyota again.
"05 15, 2017",Its a very nice car for the price.,Its a very nice car for the price. Its very balanced and comfortable and the awd is a very nice feature for the pacific nw .
"05 14, 2017",Excellent Vehicle,"We got the base model LE and it came with great standard safety features including Smart Stop Technology, backup camera, and lane departure alert."
"05 14, 2017",Excited to Own Another Toyota,Love the comfortable ride and looking forward to the better gas mileage! This is my 5th Toyota that I have purchased.
"05 13, 2017",Downsized from Toyota Sienna and love it.,"Love our navigation system, blue tooth, handling, our leather seats, to mention a few. After owning vans for the last 30 plus years, we were wondering if a smaller vehicle would work for us. We just love our new car."
"05 12, 2017",Love the Rav4,"The Rav4 is an excellent vehicle, this being my third one. It is comfortable and reliable especially for long distance."
"05 11, 2017",RAV4 LE no-frills comfort and utility,"My RAV4 LE is a basic model that still provides a reasonably comfortable and quiet ride for an AWD. I did not want to pay for so-called luxury features, and found a great deal during April's $2000 cash back sale. As a senior, I wanted easy access, safety, and reliability which the RAV4 LE provided over other small SUV's."
"05 11, 2017",Love having a Toyota back!,This is a very comfortable and stylish small SUV.  Just slightly more room than a car yet giving you the great car type gas mileage.  Feels great to be back in a Toyota again!!!!
"05 10, 2017",Family Favorite,"It's hard not to love a RAV4...and this year's model is improved over the past with its wider wheelbase, smoother ride and ease of collapsing the back seats. We love its versatility for riding, hauling, and parking. And our local deal gave us an offer we couldn't refuse! We shopped around, but RAV4 was top choice for us."
"05 10, 2017",I feel safe and comfortable,"overall, reliability and comfort are good, looks great..  I wish it got better gas mileage but for the size, not much better out there!"
"05 10, 2017",Liking it!,"I've only had the RAV4 hybrid for 10 days, but I've been happy with everything about it so far.  I've driven a little over 700 miles of city, freeway, mountain highway and back country gravel roads while getting 35.1 MPG.  I really like the feature that detects pedestrians that I might not see otherwise and the feature that keep separation between my vehicle and the one in front of me.  So far, I'm really liking it!"
"05 10, 2017",RAV4 is the best car I've ever owned!,Really made a great  Choice with this Toyota RAV4! It's  Smooth to drive. Very  quiet and has so much space very  roomey. It's has a look of an very  expensive brand on the outside the  design is perfect  and stylish!
"05 10, 2017",Stylish and sleek,The crossover vehicle I just purchased is very modern and hip and totally makes driving enjoyable again.
"05  9, 2017","Sleek, Stylish -- Perfect","I downsized from a 2013 Toyota Sienna (family of 6) to a 2017 Rav4 (seats 5).  Although it's one less seat, I am very happy with it. The interior is very sleek and stylish, the seats are black leather (which many of them come with cloth seats) and very comfortable -- nice back support. The back seats can incline or be laid down for storage. I enjoy all of the safety features. Nice stereo system. I'm starting to feel my age again and not like a ""mom"". Love it!"
"05  9, 2017",Kari Harris,love it and so smooth of a ride. never had a Toyota before and just love it . handles so easy and great on gas and easy to use for shopping and having passengers
"05  7, 2017",Great car for anyone to use.,I love everything about this car. From the features it has like reverse camera and lane sensor to the Bluetooth radio. I love how comfortable it is and how cheap the gas is.
"05  6, 2017",Excellent car,Very impressed with exterior and VERY comfortable ride. Controls and features are easy to use (and figure out ).
"05  6, 2017",technologically smart car for a babyboomer,"We are very pleased with the decision to purchase RAV4 EXL 2017 . The deciding point were the built in safety features, beautiful extetior and roomier interior. My husband us a diehard fan of toyota RAV4. Our previous car was also rav4. The old RAV 4 is still in avery good running condition and we decided to donste it to a charity"
"05  4, 2017",Amazing,It's smooth and runs well. I save money on gas and it's not a hybrid. It's easy to clean and it has many safety features.
"05  4, 2017",2017 RAV4,It is so easy to get into & out of.  The beep from the lane changer is a little surprising especially when I didn't think I was drifting.  Love the auto headlights.  The interior is very user friendly.  Everything is within reach.  There are cup holders & bottle holders.  Still getting used to the backup camera.  I feel very secure in this vehicle.  So nice ti have hands free phone for when I need it.  Great sound system & lots of air bags.
"05  3, 2017",First new car I've  owned,I love the  way it performs  and all the safety features it has. like the front and rear parking sonar
"05  3, 2017",most important decision I have ever made.,"I bought the RAV4. it  is the  most important t decision I have ever made.
it drives very smooth. great value."
"05  2, 2017",Rav4 Platinum,"I purchased this car for a great price! Its comes fully loaded and very stylish! This site helped me get the BEST,  plus I negotiated. Im happy!!"
"05  2, 2017",Offers a smooth ride with great gas mileage,Great family car. Very spacious. The new design is very elegant. Toyota is a very reliable car make and this car really shows why.
"05  1, 2017",Purchased a Rav 4,"Very comfortable, well appointed, very suitable for Upstate NY weather conditions.
Had excellent assistance throughout purchase experience"
"05  1, 2017",Happy Rav driver,"Our family has 4 Toyotas and we have loved them all. This is the first Rav but like all the others, it is a great car."
"05  1, 2017",Not all changes are positive,"I also own a 2010 RAV 4, which I love.  Lots of upgrades with the electronics on the 2017.  The backup camera is nice, the radar guided cruise is a blessing and a curse.  The lane indicator is just annoying.  I like that the spare is inside the car.  I DO NOT like that the rear door is now a hatch rather than a door.  No more closing the door with your hands full.  

The interior seems a bit plasticy/cheap."
"05  1, 2017",Love my RAV4,Haven't bought a car in 17 years and finally not the bullet and bought a New RAV4 and I love it. I look forward to many adventures I'll have with my new RAV4. There is plenty of room to but my bike in the back of the Rav4  without taking the front wheel off. As well as plenty of room for camping gear! Very happy with my purchase!
"04 30, 2017",Toyota is Toyota,"I wanted to buy a car and I was hesitant between Toyota RAV4 , Nissan Rouge, Jeep Cherokee, and I bought Toyota at the end , it is better"
"04 30, 2017",Best engineered car I've ever owned.,My wife and I love this car and often fight over who's going to do the driving..Don't know how reliable it will be but being the owner of a previous  Toyota I'm sure it will be very reliable.
"04 29, 2017",The best SUV,This is the best SUV. This is our 3 car that we purchased and we are so happy with our new car. The car isn't too big that what we wanted to buy. Before buying check the futures for the car
"04 27, 2017",Great SUV,"We had never bought a Toyota before and were pleasantly surprised at all the features for the money. It is an excellent ride, looks stylish, and was a great value for the money. It lacks a little in performance, but gets us where we are going, and saves us fuel costs over the Explorer which we used to drive. We like the 2 year 24 month free maintenance with purchase and are looking forward to many years of care free driving."
"04 26, 2017",Stylish,"Teach W. At the Owings Mills location really worked hard for me to get into my RAV4, She was extremely knowledgeable, patient and caring, about the vehicle. I know I wore her out with questions and she answered every one. Teah W. Made me feel like it was about me and not making a sale. 10 all across the board, thanks a bunch Teah W."
"04 26, 2017",Great car!,"Comfort, convenience and wonderful adaptable technology creates a safe and high performance ride.  I love the galactic agua/black.

"04 26, 2017",I am enjoying the Rav4,It is so much easier to get in and out of.  It is so comfortable  to drive.  I love the color and the ease in driving.  Driving home was great and easy.
"04 25, 2017",Too new to articulate,"I only have about 165 miles on my new RAV4 Ltd. so far but ""so far, so good"" is all I can say.  I have looked at RAV4's for several years and I was finally ready to purchase since I was gifting my Solara to my grandson for college graduation in May.  The reviews in Consumer Reports and from friends that own one was good enough for me to buy one...looking forward to many good years and miles in my RAV4 Ltd."
"04 25, 2017",Love!!,I love the Toyota Rav 4. I originally went in to look at the 2017 Highlander with 3rd row seating. I didn't like it as it seemed hard to get to the back row without the captain chairs. To go to that model it was out of my budget. With the third row seating there wasn't much room to place anything in the back area. So I decided the Rav 4 was a better fit for my needs.
"04 24, 2017",Toyota Rav-4 2017,"Toyota makes the best car i have ever owned, I have TWO Rav-4  1- 2003 and now a 2017"
"04 22, 2017",2017 toyota Rav4 Limited,"Traded a 2014 Rav4 Limited for the additional TSS-P safety features on the 2017 version.  Really love the radar cruise control, and the additional insulation to quiet the ride! Still disappointed that leather interior is not offered."
"04 22, 2017",Our new Rav/4,"The Rav/4 has all the features we were looking for in a new SUV.   The standard safety features, such as lane departure and distance to obstacles/vehicles directly in front of you will prove to be valuable.   I especially like the eco mode that works to save fuel.   We've only owned for a couple days, but we are certain we will continue to love it"
"04 22, 2017",Have owned many Toyotas.,"This is the 7th Toyota I have bought new. 
I have always been very satisfied with them & my 2017 Rave 4 XLE is no exception. Superior quality.



























this is"
"04 22, 2017",Awsome inside and out,We bought our RAV 4 for many reasons after comparing it to other similar sized SUVs. We loved the feel and handling of it on the road. The interior offered comfortable seating and lots of leg room in back seat as well as front. They had wonderful colors to choose frm and the exterior style was attractive. Also the safety technology was amazing.
"04 22, 2017",Happiness,Love the color and the way it drives.  I feel very safe and secure in the car because I am sitting up high and can see
"04 21, 2017",I love my new Rav4!,"Toyotas are amazing and the Rav4 is no exception. Even Honda Laura on Youtube found the Rav4 to be sleek, comfortable, and well-designed in comparison to the Honda CRV. I personally find the both the exterior and interior design of the Rav4 to be better than the CRV. I own the SE model and I am glad I waited for that design (rather than the LE). It has many added features. This is the best car I have ever owned!"
"04 21, 2017",Another great Toyota,We love our Toyotas & look forward to driving our current reliable Toyotas & purchasing more Toyotas in the future.
"04 21, 2017",Rav 4 is awesome,"Great handling, comfortable, affordable, reliable.   Great in snow too!  

I have had four Ravs. I just helped my mother purchase her first one."
"04 21, 2017",Third RAV4,While I have had my new 2017 Toyota RAV4 for only a very short period of time I am extremely impressed with it.  This is the 3rd new RAV4 that I have purchased and find this new one as the very best.  Of course it is my first Hybrid model but the Safety package is outstanding.  The added horse power provides quick acceleration and the ride is much softer than previous RAV4's that I have owned.  The cabin is quiet offering a very pleasant interior environment for conversation or listening to the radio.  I have already advised several friends to consider exploring purchasing a 2017 RAV4.
"04 21, 2017",2017 RAV4 good buy,"great value for the money, like all the new safety features that were made standard, solid built car."
"04 20, 2017",Rav/REVs,"Things were going great until I had some tire issues only a week into leasing this car.
Other than than, gas mileage great for such a big car, it feels very safe, I like being a bit higher than a sedan but not too much, more room for my kids and dog in the back!"
"04 19, 2017",dash clock,"can anyone tell me how to set the instrument clock ??
its one pain in the BUTT.. even the sales manager could not say how to get it off army time 
CAN Anyone HELP 
Thanks John Zeman"
"04 15, 2017",Excellant Value and Safety!,I'm am very impressed with the Rav4. Excellent safety features standard and a great value for your money. This is my first Toyota and I am very surprised how much I love this vehicle. I have owned many makes in the past and this is by far one of my favorites. Its a great ride the safety features like lane departure are great they alert you but are not annoying like other makers alerts. The back up camera is easier for me to understand than other cars I have had. So impressed!
"04 14, 2017",Mrs. & Mrs.,"Outstanding experience!  All employees at the Braintree Dealership were extremely professional and helpful.  Would highly recommend - very pleasant non-stressful
experience."
"04 14, 2017",Robert Simms,Just bought car on 4-12-2017 havent owned it long enough to comment on its reliabilty but I fully expect it to be great....real nice car. Had to give it a rating to submit.
"04 13, 2017",sharp,everybody should experience a rav4
"04 13, 2017",Love the vehicle,"Only negatives are with the interior. Wish there had been more of a choice of fabric color.
Also, need more room for small incidentals, like the Camry has..."
"04 12, 2017",Most reliable car,Good decision I have made about selecting car and dealers sbip good salesperson Sunil I me at Brandon toyota
"04 11, 2017",Great New Car,"After having my Jeep for almost 8 years, it was finally time for a new car. I had been looking for a while and fell in love with the RAV4. So far it has been an amazing car. I love the features from the backup camera, lane detection, and the great gas mileage for an SUV. Could not have picked a better, more stylish new ride."
"04 10, 2017",Very well equipped car,"I am impressed by the fact that Toyota cares enough of its customers to provide them with all safety features as a standard, rather than reserve those features for only the high-priced models"
"04  9, 2017",Good ride,Love the hatchback touch opener & sun roof design
"04  8, 2017",Getting used to a new car,Had Toyota's in he past. Changed to Ford . Now back to Toyota. I like it. We also have a 2005 Toyota Solara Convertible. It is the nicest convertible on the street. We are sorry that Toyota stopped making them. I'm sure we would have bought another Solara convertible
"04  7, 2017",Pretty car,First computer car We have owned!Like the black interior &the white outside color combination. First new car. We have had in a long time
"04  6, 2017",my 4th Toyota,"perfect size for me, handles great and good gas mileage"
"04  6, 2017",Toyota Rav4,"I purchased a new Toyota Rav4 from Mr.David Ho, he is great business person and he explained to my and my wife everything about our investment and we understood everything,  we would like to say thank you to  Mr  David Ho and we rating  him with  (A+)"
"04  5, 2017",2017 RAV 4,Just upgraded from a 2013 RAV 4.  The\is the best car that I've owned! The forward visibility is beyond compare!  I love the standard safety features that Toyota has installed in this vehicle.
"04  4, 2017",BEST car I ever owned,"I highly recommend the Toyota Rav4. Especially with all the great new safety features. Safe, fun to drive and looks like a million bucks! I love it :)"
"04  4, 2017",I love my rav4,"Great car , very happy with all the options it comes with. The ability to be awd unless 50/50 4wd is needed is a great attribute"
"04  3, 2017",PERFECT!,"Couldn't be happier with vehicle.  Handles better than expected.  Very solid vehicle and ride is SWEET!!!  Bigger inside than I thought and the 2017 style is beyond expectations.  Glad I gave it a chance and it is just the perfect purchase for me. BEST overall purchase experience to date!  Paul Costouros was very thorough, patient and above all very  knowledgeable with all aspects of the process.  The process was seamless and smooth as silk from start to finish.  Jack Prato was great with explaining the financing process and I was in and out in no time.  I received an excellent deal for my new vehicle and very pleased that I took my friends advice to go see Paul at Bredemann Toyota for my new purchase.  Forget the rest...I FOUND THE BEST!!!  I am looking forward to my new dealership relationship and couldn't be happier with my purchase and being a part of the Bredemann Family."
"04  1, 2017",Can't wait to drive it more,"first Toyota and can't wait to drive it
heard lots of good comments, reviews about the brand
comfortable and good price"
"04  1, 2017",Love it!,"Great smooth ride, trust it to get me through the snow, love the look of it. Love the back up camera and that I can connect my phone via Bluetooth through the radio. And a moonroof- perfect!"
"03 31, 2017",2017 Rav 4,Very nice car and with the new security features it worth every dollar. I love it and my family too. I recommend this car with no doubt
"03 30, 2017",Toyota Rav4,Very smooth to handle and comfortable in all aspects.. powerful and good handling. I liked interior design very much.
"03 29, 2017","Excellent, comfortable and with the technology","Before buying a car I always see the Reviews, but when driving I reaffirm a comfortable car, hard body, good power and above all highly efficient in consumption."
"03 28, 2017",Owner,This is the second Rav4 my family has purchased and we love it.  I do wish there were more cup  holders
"03 27, 2017",The Car Of The Future,I love my new Rav4. I wish it still came in a V6. But overall I love everything about it and the new body shape. I am very impress with all the bells and whistles this car has.
"03 26, 2017",Rav4 is a beautiful vehicle,We last owned a Rav three years ago.  The changes made to the design and safety wowed us.  Such a classy looking vehicle.
"03 26, 2017","A Real Gem in Style, Safety and Comfort","I just purchased a Toyota RAV4 SE and couldn't be happier. The safety features  and solid feel are excellent. The comfort and performance are also fantastic! You really feel you are driving a super high end car in all aspects. To be honest there are 3 things that I was disappointed with--my car had the Entunes Connected GPS Navigation System.  Very much a let down in what you would expect- no way to get a map showing as you drove or even when getting directions. You got arrows and voice but no map. Also, no way to get the Entune apps promoted and showing. I called Entunes, Toyota, the GPS company and they all said those things not able to work in this model navigation system plus, you cannot install the Premium Entunes system to replace the connected one as hardware not included. The map was important to me, so I had to go to outside vendor and have a brand name navigation system installed. The second feature, no integration of garage door opener into the car in any way. I have to carry my opener with me. The outside vendor said they possibly could add something for several hundred dollars but after the navigation change out, definitely could not justify spending hundreds more just to not carry my garage door opener. The 3rd things, the splash up is atrocious. My car is white and after driving a few miles in rainy weather, the top surface of the back bumper was black, along with the entire rear liftgate and window, coated in mud film.  I had mud flaps installed by the dealer and happy to say--excellent value for the money, the rear of the Rav stays clean now. They look sharp and are a solid addition.  I also had the side mouldings put on, good additional protection and really improves the appearance of the vehicle. After those modifications, I feel I am driving a top car in comfort, safety, appearance and reliability.  As far as safety features, Toyota now equips their Ravs with just about everything you could think of and it works so well.  This car is luxury in safety features, comfort, reliability and appearance. Still have a constant smile on my face as I drive it. One other things, Toyota now has as standard the type of shifting system that cars like the Prius have had before, the anticipated shifting where you don't even feel the car shift, leads to much better fuel consumption, better ride and performance and more steady acceleration when you need to increase your speed, like when entering a freeway.  By the way, if you happen to be in the Oregon area, a dealer in Hillsboro, Royal Moore Toyota, no personal connection, has a unique 20,000 mile Power Train Warranty, along with making a car buying experience  so enjoyable and one in which you end up with friends, in every department. The personal care and recognition from your first day on is exceptional!"
"03 26, 2017",Great vehicle,"I have owned this vehicle for about 2 months and miss some of the features on my previous vehicle, but am overall well pleased with it.  Love the blind sport mirrors, lane beepers, and the automatic slowing feature while in cruise control"

"03 25, 2017",Great Car!,"The Toyota RAV4 is a really fun car to drive, and it's loaded with safety features!  It's all wheel drive SUV, which is nice because you sit higher than a car.  It's a good car to drive in the winter because of its traction with the all wheel drive.  It handles really well, too.  I highly recommend it!"

"03 24, 2017",Awesome car for student driver...,We picked this car for a new driver in the household.  we really liked all the safety features it offers and makes us feel a bit better about letting them drive on their own.  The safety features was definitely the selling point.

"03 20, 2017",Seek to have this be a terrific vehicle.,Looking forward to a wonderful experience. It is a new SUV for us & we are anxious to have fun & pleasure with it.
"03 20, 2017",HAPPY WITH MY TOYOTA RAV4 2017,"LOVELY AN ECONOMY CAR, THE PEOPLE FROM THIS DEALER SI SO NICE AND HELPFUL!
Y RECOMMEND 100% PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS DEALER"
"03 19, 2017",Its my 3rdd Rav so you can see I love it.,"My only complaint was I can't reach the rear hatch back to close it, should of got an automatic closer. Wasn't aware I would be too short."
"03 19, 2017",2017 Rav4,"The only thing Toyota got wrong on this model is the alignment of the sunvisor & rearview mirror. You can't lower the visor & then push it forward & up to block sun, but maintain visibilty. This is due to the visor hitting the rearview mirror. A pain for taller people like me!"
"03 19, 2017",Great 2017 RAV 4,"This is my 2nd RAV4, I also owned a 2010, they are a very reliable vehicle. They are very comfortable and fun to drive."
"03 16, 2017",Great car,"I've only had the vehicle a week, but I love it! Handles well, gets great gas mileage. I only wish the passenger seat had electric adjustments, instead of manual."
"03 14, 2017","Excellent, reliable vehicle!","Very pleased with this vehicle. Everything about it is absolutely great! I'm looking forward to 4 wheel drive, especially with recent weather. Overall very satisfied!!!"
"03 14, 2017",Amazing vehicle,Not one single complaint! I am beyond happy about my vehicle and can't wait to continue driving it for years to come!
"03 14, 2017",Loving my car,Was very happy with the comfort and ease if driving this car. And thank goodness for the all wheel drive during this march snow
"03 13, 2017",Most impressive SUV I have had the pleasure of dri,The RAV4 surpassed the expectations I had for this small SUV. I was expecting something good and was really impressed with what I received.
"03 12, 2017",Rav 4 -- the second one we've owned.,"Very nice car. Good gas mileage.  This is our second Rav 4. Traded in a 2013 for the Platinum series .  It has many of the same features you would find on the Highlander, but is a bit smaller with better gas mileage. The foot sweep to open the rear hatch is great. And the heated steering wheel is a welcomed feature living in Wisconsin. Could have a little smoother ride, but overall great."
"03 12, 2017",Platinum Trim Level Rocks!,"Well, we have one reasonably long trip and 1000 miles on it, and thought it was time to provide at least the initial impressions.  Let me begin by saying I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage (approx. 27mpg on the trip and about 22mpg locally) but that from a perspective of a Prius owner that is used to getting 50+mpg, so temper that.  To go along with that, the engine is just a little anemic; I wish there had been a larger 4 cyl or a small 6 cyl engine.  The seats are firm (and we both love the Sof-Tex in lieu of leather), providing what both my wife and I feel is excellent support, and the car is relatively firmly sprung, at least by the standards of a Prius.  It felt truly excellent on the 500+ mile trip.  There are amenities galore and safety features that I have just begun to explore.  I will write a follow-up review further down the road when I have more miles on it and more understanding of what everything does.  So far, it is an excellent, comfortable automobile, and we both have fallen in love with its ride and its comfort.  I must say, having never had one, the heated steering wheel rocks!"
"03 10, 2017","Reliable, Great safety features","Had a 2014, but the new safety features pushed me into trading for a new one. The adaptive Cruise Control is great and the lane assist."
"03  6, 2017",You Can't Beat the Reliability & Style for the $$,"I come from a high-performance car family (Porsche, Triumph, Jaguars, Vipers, etc) and to me, this is the best looking,  best performing SUV on the market. I've had two Rav4s previously and will never settle for anything else when it comes to buying an SUV."
"03  2, 2017",RAV4 - second one even better than the first,I traded a 2009 Toyota RAV4 in for a 2017 RAV4 and live my new car. Drives so smooth and for a 4 cylinder it had plenty of get up and go.  Very smooth ride even over constructions area rough rodes.  Hope to keep this one for another 125K miles.
"02 27, 2017",Great Car,Perfect vehicle for someone who needs a small SUV loaded up with all the tech and safety features. Gas mileage is great and my dealer experience was superb
"02 22, 2017",paper work,"got a 2017 rav 4 xle and it did not even have compass.over $30,000 and no compass.Had to pay over $300 to get one. How sad is that??"
"01 27, 2017",A very good car I love it.,My sales person Ricardo Tuazon at Rte 440 Hudson Toyota Jersey City NJ.  He's very knowledgeable and  provides good suggestion in getting a new car. I will recommend him to my friends and other relatives.
"01 26, 2017",Best buying experience ever,"The two toned interior leather is amazing looking. Dealer I purchase from is Big Two Toyota. My sales rep was ""Griz"" Griffin. This was my most pleasant purchase of a new car ever. I'm 67. I've purchased 5 new cars. This dealership and honest retail experience was awesome!"
"01  9, 2017",One disappointment,"This is our seconD RAV 4, had a2011 and have a 2014 both new. Biggest probem w have had is the rough ride, they have no suspension for rough roads.  Hit a bump and you feel like you have bottomed out. Need to smooth out the suspension and have a replacement kit to fixit."
"11 29, 2016",Happy Customers,"In April of 2016 we purchase a Toyota Rav4, with the help of salesman Tom Vosnos.  We loved the new Rav4, so when we needed a second car, we went back to Bredemann Toyota and purchase a second Rav4 (2017) with Tom's help.  We are very happy with both vehicles.  Great car, great service."
"11  2, 2016",The RAV4 is a good vehicle.,"A friend and I each bought a RAV4. Overall it is a good vehicle. However, the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've experienced."

"07  6, 2017",Smart Investment,"I love my new Rav 4. The safety features alone and the peace of mind this gives me. I bought this car for my wife and my two 5 year old twins. I feel much better when They are out and about. The design is great. With all the great electronic features this car has. 2 small improvements I would suggest, power seats would be awesome. And when the car is sold update the navigation system before handing off to the buyer. Or include a map update in the sales package."
"07  5, 2017",Loving it!!!!,"I absolutely love it! Roomy, stylish, comfortable,  and great gas mileage.  I love all the safety features and how smooth of a ride it is. Lots of storage space too!!!"

My Daughter wants one now!"
"07  2, 2017","So exceptional, I bought another one!","My RAV4 is exactly what everyone would want in a small SUV. The look is just sporty enough, but provides the ultimate in safety and handling. The size fits me, as I can slide right in and the controls are so accessible. The Rav4's performance and reliability are what gives it the added appeal. When I compared the Rav 4 to other models, it ranked far above the rest. Throughly pleased with my purchase!"
"07  1, 2017",Names say for all.,"Toyota being a leader in manufacturing of great cars. The reliability is unbeaten by anyone in today's market, being said that their car in long run worth every penny you have send on. 

Toyota as I have owned have given me what I want and truly have great models and safety features, as most of the other have started to provide one after they interduced in 2017."

"06 27, 2017",Rav it up,"I love my new Rav4 Limited edition. I still find myself looking for places to go so I can ride around in it. I previously owned a Toyota Camry and until the day I sold it ( to a co-worker who knew what a great car it was and what good care it had ) and said good by. Even after I bought an Acura I kept the Camry for awhile, I had a hard time parting with it. I`m already attached to my new Rav4. It rides so nice, seating is very comfy and ample. I love the safety features, I`m all for safety and prevention. It has too many great features to get into.......just take one for a drive and you will see. Toyota makes great products that are reliable, made roomy and comfortable and they have style and class. I am sooo ready for a rode trip with my new Rav4."
"06 26, 2017","Love, love, love my car!","I just love my car.  It is by far one of the most comfortable vehicles I've ever been in.   By far, it is the best car I've ever driven.  Its' seats are extremely comfortable. I really like the design of the dash board.  It just seems to me that everything is in the right place.  The car handless like a dream.  You really should test drive one.  You'll love it!"
"06 24, 2017",my third Rav 4....bulletproof,"Solid, dependable vehicle. A bit underpowered, but has enough power to get the job done. New design is sharp. Attractive inside and out."
"06 24, 2017",Very reliable.,I am very satisfied with my choice. It's my first Toyota and I love it. I know it will serve its purpose.
"06 24, 2017",Great vehicle,"My new Rav 4 is great and very stylish.  I owned another Rav 4 for 11 years and when I traded her in, I knew that I wanted the same make of vehicle."
"06 24, 2017",Our 3rd RAV4! Never buy anything else!!,"We love the RAV4. We just keep buying another. We kept the last one for over 10 years and even then couldn't decide if we should trade for the newer one. There's room for the dogs (German Shepherd, Springer Spaniel) and all the luggage you could ever want to carry. It's never had trouble passing a car or avoiding a problem THEY ARE GREAT!!!"
"06 23, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The safety features such as BSM and forward radar are great. 

We drove the new car 2000 miles to Disney World and it handled great on the highway.

My wife likes the extra visibility that the car offers."
"06 22, 2017",Awesome car!,"The rav 4 is a great car overall, comfortable, sleek style exterior, interior is functional, plenty of space in the back seats for kids and adults! The trunk has great space capacity. A great family car, would highly recommend it!"
"06 22, 2017",Awesome vehicle,"Comfortable, great pick up for a 4 cylinder.   Style is and out is fantastic.  Very roomy.  Lots of extras that come standard."
"06 21, 2017",Worst SUV,"This is a silk purse made from a pigs skin, in other words appearances are deceiving. Very very very thin sheet metal on the main body, engine knock at 800 miles, gas mileage is distorted..gets about 20 city 24 highway normal driving with I passenger. Not capable or worthy of a maintoned gravel road and I would not recommend ever leaving pavement . Seat material is flimsy, dash parts cheap plastic, carpeting is like paper material....."
"06 21, 2017","Excellent ride, handling and economy","Vehicle fills our needs exactly. Handles great, drives well, parks easily and is comfortable.  Great values for the purchase price."
"06 21, 2017",Knew the minute I sat in the driver seat...,"That this vehicle was for me. This is a fun little SUV with tons of safety features. I've got the Limited and am so happy I jumped up my budget for all the extras. The controls are user-friendly, the drivers seat exceptionally comfortable and the ride surprisingly smooth. Kudos to Toyota for a bold new color as well. Black Currant is just plain pretty."
"06 20, 2017",Like it,"Drove the rav4and really like it liked the color  the leather seats the salesman was great and the people, the salesman explained all teachers. .left jasper with a full tank of gas any happy"
"06 19, 2017",Toyota,"I love my New Rav4! It is so comfortable. The dash is so easy to see everything and reach. Having the back up camera and the peeps, if someone is walking behind is awesome. Also with my arms full of packages to be able to wave my foot under the car and my back door opens. The blind spot monitors are a great help. I can park and push a button and see if my car is parked correctley.Handles great on side roads and the freeway. Has a lot of pick up. Nice smooth ride. Will have my Rav4 for a long time!"
"06 18, 2017",Very dependable and comfortable,"I love the comfort and ease of use, all instruments work smoothly.  Very stylish and due to our winters, I am grateful that all wheel drive comes with this model.  Very nice.  Salesperson Miranda M made the whole experience very quick and comfortable."
"06 18, 2017",Very nice care for you money!,"Toyota as we all know are very reliable.
The new Rav4 is very aggressive-looking and sporty on the inside as well. The four cylinder is very reliable not as powerful as some would hope but it still gets the job done. very roomy inside the rear seats recline just like the front. The JBL sound system is amazing. For the price you can't go wrong with the RAV4 test drive one today."
"06 16, 2017",Most sleek car I own,"The color of exterior and interior is what I really wanted.  Economical and dependable. Good legroom, and I got all the features I wanted for a new car."
"06 15, 2017",No problems at all,"Our previous car was a Toyota Camry that was the most reliable car we have ever owned even after 192,000 miles. But even the Camry had to be taken back to the shop a couple times for the first thousand miles or so to fix some initial problems. The RAV4 has had absolutely no problems at all. It appears to be a highly refined design. It is a pleasure to drive. It is probably the last car we will ever own since I am now 75 years old."
"06 12, 2017",Love my new Toyota - totally reliable,The comfort is excellent - awesome suspension which I know I can count on this vehicle to travel not only for commuting but for visiting out of town.
"06 12, 2017",Safest Car on the Road!,"Previous to my leasing my 2017 Rav4 this past weekend, I drove a 2010 Mazda Tribute.  Having bought my lease out 2 years ago, I have been shopping around for the next vehicle to lease.  I knew I wanted a smaller SUV similar to the size of the Tribute, but was looking for safety, reliability, and backseat legroom.  I currently drive for both of my elderly parents and was concerned about their ability to get in and be comfortable in the backseat and have room for walkers, etc.  I am ULTRA IMPRESSED about the safety rating of the Rav4.  I am way passed wanting to impress anyone with my car, but I can say after just 4 days I LOVE my Rav4.  I actually had the opportunity to drive a Rav4 back in 2008 when my car was stolen and was in the shop for repair after recovery.  I drove the rental for a little more than a month and it was what really sparked my interest in the car.  I actually liked the way the tailgate opened then as it is more user friendly for women, but understand the concept of the tailgate lifting open as well.  Since that time, it was always on my radar if the opportunity presented itself."
"06  7, 2017",Love my new car -,"Love the comfort and convenience of my new RAV 4 and Karl Malone Toyota has been great to work with and take care of me and my questions. Of course, I have only had it for two weeks - hope it keeps performing so great!"
"06  6, 2017","I have always loved the Rav, now it is even better",I love this car. It is just as fancy and stylish as a Lexus without the price. I would choose a Toyota every time. I have owned 3 Rav-4.
"06  5, 2017",Great Car for the money. Good value.,Good size SUV.  Handles great on the road.  Great with getting in and out of traffic and parking. Feels sturdy.
"06  5, 2017",Best of the Non Luxury two row SUV's,"We test drove most of the competitive models. We found the RAV4 the best bang for the buck. We got the XLE with convenience package that includes push button start, power lift gate and nav. Rides nicely for a small SUV and the seats are comfortable. Good leg room in the back. We don't  intend to drag race so the 0-60 will do."
"06  3, 2017",2017 Rav4 LE,"We decided on this vehicle for several reasons . The size is perfect for us even as a primary vehicle. We had owned Toyotas before and knew of their reliability and we looking for a smaller vehicle with better fuel milage than the one we had. Even though the LE model is a base model it is equipped with more features than we were expecting, exactly what we were looking for. After 1200 miles we are averaging 26 mpg city, 31 hwy. and 28 over all. We bought this one off the dealers lot but had we ordered we would have ordered the exact same model. Very pleased !!!!!"
"06  2, 2017",My new car I love it,"Everything I wanted  in my new car Moonroof Power Hatch alloy Wheels  blootooth

"06  2, 2017","The 3rd Rav 4 I've owned dependable,built to last","The Rav 4 has a smooth ride can carry a family of four and a dog comfortably.Gas mileage fair and it sharp lines are classy clean,have owned three Rav 4sand enjoyed driving all of them great purchase."
"06  1, 2017",My first Suv,I love it  and absolutely love it. I've wanted this car for a very long time and finally have it. Very smooth drive and roomy.
"05 31, 2017",Shockingly amazing,"I wanted a car with bigger engine but this size. Left me looking at jeep Cherokee but the bigger engine drove poorly, had a 2012 Tucson and it was sluggish and slow but with a similar size engine this car is great to drive and comfortable. Was looking at Infiniti qx30 also and the RAV4 had more features than the Infiniti."
"05 31, 2017",LOVE THIS CAR!,"Drives great!  I feel safe in this vehicle.  The safety features are awesome, and the ride is very smooth."
"05 31, 2017",Better that I ever had,"For family this is the best deal, economy in gas, very quiet, a lot of safety features in the new Rav4."
"05 31, 2017",happyrav4owner,"LOVE.  LOVE.  LOVE.  Everything about this vehicle.  Size is great, gas mileage is good and has all the bells and whistles I wanted!!!"
"05 31, 2017",This is the second RAV 4 we own.,Gives us us everything we need in a car.  Like how it handles and the service is excellent and we liked it so well this is the second RAV 4 we now own.
"05 31, 2017","So far, I love this car.  I only had it 2 weeks...",So far I love this car.  Only have had it for 2 weeks and still learning all the good about it.    I love the open space inside.  Feels great on the road.  I appreciate the beeps when I cross the white or yellow line.. It's a reminder.
"05 30, 2017",Love it!,Very spacious. Really easy to use for someone that's not good with technology. Would recommend it to anyone!
"05 29, 2017",outstanding vehicle,"meets all our needs.Car has many safety items,gets great gas milage,feels  secure on road and is fun to drive."
"05 29, 2017",Fantastic Car,I bought this car about 3 weeks ago.  I had a Camrey and loved it.  This car is large inside with plenty of room to spread out and take a long trip.  The car is very comfortable to ride and drive.  This car can pick up speed quickly in the sport mode and pass cars with ease. It is easy to drive and drives smoothly.
"05 28, 2017",Perfect cat,Great car. Lots of safety features and rides as good as any high dollar car. You will not be sorry if you buy This car.
"05 28, 2017",Great small SUV.,"The RAV4 we purchased is an XLE. It is stylish as well as functional. The Infotainment system keeps you aware of how your car is performing, as well as entertains you. In Sport Mode, the steering is a bit tighter and the pick-up is a bit quicker, which makes merging onto highways easier. I find I usually drive in the ""normal"" mode, which automatically switches to eco mode as you drive, especially when in traffic. It is a fantastic little SUV which has great cargo space for groceries, as well as hauling the usual stuff a family will take with them. Thankfully, my kids are all grown, but for a family with growing kids, it would be great as you have four doors to access the back seats (which have child safety locks), and the ""trunk"" space is ample for carrying the usual child related items. My husband put all of his metal detecting hardware in the trunk and had space left over to put my stuff. I look forward to having this vehicle for the next 10+ years, as I have no doubt it will last that long, even with my 100 mile per day commute to work. I foresee this being an incredible purchase. Toyota has a great reputation for vehicles lasting a long time. My 2002 Sienna served me well until someone hit it in the rear at 60 mph when traffic stopped. It was hard enough to fold it in half. That was in  2008. It gave me absolutely no problems in 6 years. I will bet this RAV4 will do the same. Great vehicle, great deals right now."
"05 27, 2017",Dependable with a Capital B,The RAV-4 is a quiet ride. I like how it gives the option for the engine to give me the option to either use money saving economy miles or give me power when I need it. The standard feature of blue tooth lets me make or receive phone calls just by pushing a button without taking my hands off the steering wheel. I like being able to sit and have a higher view of the road. It maneuvers easily and is able to take sharp turns in residential areas. I feel like I can go anywhere without having something breaking down and can't wait to take it on a long road trip.
"05 27, 2017",Very confortable,"Right fit for me and my family , great size for the family of 4 , enough space , comfortable, easy to navigate, great value"
"05 27, 2017",Most reliable,This car has more legroom trank has more space my children put their bayke in the trank this car more comfortable for driving

"05 25, 2017",Very stylish and sleek interior.,Wanted a vehicle that was easy to get in and out off.  Plus I wanted to be able to pull a small utility trailer.
"05 24, 2017",My 2nd RAV4,"The vehicle is comfortable, dependable, and the right size.  The seats adjust for shorter people, making it easier to see the road.  It handles well."
"05 24, 2017",Really Cool Multipurpose vehicle.,"The Rav 4 is pretty cool for a SUV, we've fought long & hard against having one, but in the end we had to give in due to needs. The Rav is small, yet big enough to meet the needs we have as a family. It drives like a car, which isn't something you'll experience in most SUV's"
"05 23, 2017",Reliable and safe vehicle,"Love this car, it is large enough for my needs, but not as large as my former vehicle, gets great gas mileage and has lots of safety features which were very important to me."
"05 23, 2017",LE front drive 2017 1 wk review,"All good at 1 week old!  It's a 2.5L 4 which is about the biggest 4 out there for most every mfg. (I've not heard of any larger 4. Different manufacturers offer 2.5s, 2.4s, 2.3s on down.) As you read, keep in mind it IS the lowest base fwd 6 speed automatic model,....... 

First, MPG: On this first full tank from dealer I am ~averaging~ 32.3 mpg  ;>), that's approx 65% city, 35% hwy. There are actually three modes: Sport, 'non' sport/regular mode, and ECO. In Sport it really gets out of its own way and as far as I know, ECO light -  which is right between tach and speedo, never comes on. In regular mode, the ECO light will come on when you're light on the gas pedal; goes off when stepping on it. In ECO mode it finds optimal economy shift points for best mpg. It's the 'least powerful' mode. As a test I wanted to see how high I could get the MPGs -- 45mph road I got it to hit 41.7mpg for a minute, haha.
COMFORT: On my base LE fwd -- I'm 6' 1"", would be great if the front seats slide back one or two more 'clicks' but is really ok. No frills on base model, like no lumbar dial even. but seats are comfortable enough. Back seat are plenty roomy for six footers and the seatbacks recline 60/40, and there's a fold armrest w/ 2 cup holders.
FUNCTIONALITY: Very good - Traded a 2010 Ford Explorer (which in itself is a GREAT truck). Though not as large inside of course, the Rav ~hatch opening~  is about 1"" taller [31""  +/-)  my biggie was wanted to fit a regular plastic trash barrel in, standing up - can do! need to remove cover first then once in, put cover back on, or just tilt it in w/cvr.
STYLE: I think it looks great. Many base SUVs do NOT have STANDARD tinted windows (Subaru, Chevy equinox, others, ask or just look before you buy any car.) RAV4 tint is std. I DO miss the separate hatch ~window~ open from the Explorer... it's hatch only on the RAV but no huge deal. More as I drive ;>)"
"05 22, 2017",Awesome!,"Purchased a new 2017 XLE RAV 4 AWD to replace my old 2012 Toyota RAV base model.  I work in sales--lot of miles covered every day!  The new 2017 RAV is awesome...few more bells and whistles than the base model, nice 6 inch led display along with lane departure, enhanced stereo. Ride is very comfortable, and the XLE feels luxurious for a very nice price.  No more Spare Tire on the back--and the newly designed lift gate is great considering I'm vertically challenged.  Cargo space is nice, and it comes with all weather maps-including the cargo area!  Nicely designed, comfy ride for someone on the road all day!  perfect!"
"05 22, 2017",Love this car!,I love almost everything about my 2017 RAV4 XLE. There are a few things I dislike but it's not anything  that I believe toyota could change right now. For instance. My style for some reason doesn't have side mirror defrosters which I think is weird. And mine doesn't have a CD player but o have sirus XM.
"05 21, 2017",Somewhat disappointed.,"I am somewhat disappointed in the 2017 RAV4 I purchased.  I wish I had rented one before I purchased.  The visibility out the back window is not good with the back seat headrests up.  The cover for the back part of the car does not cover the whole back area.  The rear door is very long and almost hits me when I open it. This also happened to my granddaughter who is very tall.  I wish I had gotten the automatic tailgate lift.  There is not very much storage in the doors for maps, umbrellas, etc., only storage for a water bottle.  The top center of the windshield has a black box which is very distracting when you are driving. The car is very comfortable and drives very smoothly.  Wish I could have driven one for a week before I purchased.  The Bluetooth  is difficult for the person I call to hear me."
"05 20, 2017",Fun family car,"Reliable , nice looking from the exterior. Interior is ok. It is good car for the family with plenty of space for the kids stuff."
"05 20, 2017",Love this vehicle.,This is the vehicle I was looking for. I absolutely love it. We couldn't be more pleased with the performance and look of it.

"05 19, 2017",Has all the features I wanted,"It is a sharp-looking vehicle and is ""fully-loaded"" with every feature that will make driving the car easy and fun!!  Had my last Toyota for 14 years and never had any problems---looking now for the same service :)"
"05 18, 2017",Love this car.,"This car run so smoothly and I can barely even hear the engine. I would have love the white color though but gray is not so bad either. Just tge right size for me and my family. I love the smart key system and the Bluetooth. Everything about it, I love."
"05 18, 2017",Very Roomy for a Midsize SUV,"So far very happy with the car. I have 3 medium/large dogs, and all 3 sit in the back without having to put the seats down comfortably. Very Roomy, especially for me since I am 6'3''"
"05 18, 2017",Good Size for the $,It runs well and comfortable with lots of space. I traded in a Prius for more space. The interior is sleek
"05 18, 2017",Toyotas no. one,handles well love the new safety features nice looking love driving it would highly recommend this vehicle this is the 8th Toyota in our household very reliable
"05 18, 2017",Rav4 review,This car meets our needs but I really miss my Toyota Camry. We got the Rav 4 for the all wheel drive but it doesn't have the pick up the Camry has.
"05 17, 2017",wonderful smaller SUV,i am sad to sell such a wonderful car. It is new with 320 miles on it. Lives in a garage waiting a new owner.
"05 17, 2017",My last three cars have been Toyota.  dependable.,"So far it is doing great.  The only thing I am not crazy about is no power seats.  I still can work them but would choose power seats next time.  I have taken it from Ohio to North Carolina without any problems.  It's a Toyota, what else is there to say."
"05 17, 2017",The Best I've ever Driven!,"Everything I looked for in a car, my Rav 4 XLE have it. I love this car. And it drives so smoothly. It even have steering assistance and back up camera. And I just had to have a sunroof."
"05 17, 2017",Most reliable car I've owned,"It really meets all my needs. It has enough space in the trunk for storage, enough leg space, and I love the fact that it does not consume a lot of gas."
"05 16, 2017",Nice Road car with saftey features,"The car handled nicely. We used the abundant storage spaces. The lane monitoring is an excellent safety feature.
The speed mode is an excellent feature.

Thanks"
"05 16, 2017",Nice Ride!,"While I've only had my Rav 4 for a couple of days, I am impressed with the quality of the ride I get from this vehicle.  I upgraded from a Prius, which I loved, but I think I'm falling in love with my new Rav4 for different reasons.  I feel safe and secure, and I have much better visibility than in my old car.  I know I'll have more confidence in snow due to the AWD model I purchase."
"05 16, 2017",excellent car,"I bought a new car recently and i  am excited with my new car RAV4 LE. I like exterior styling comfort, performance of the car. it worth for the money i have paid."
"05 15, 2017",Great experience with Toyota made me return,"I have less than 1K miles on my new vehicle but so far I have thoroughly enjoyed my new RAV4.  My former vehicle was a 2003 Toyota Solara SLE and I just love that car but decided to go with an SUV this time...no regrets!  Love it so far!  If the RAV4 is as reliable as my Solara (after almost 15 years), I will be extremely happy.  My grandson is the lucky recipient of my Solara...hoping he enjoys it as much as I like my new vehicle!"
"05 15, 2017",Great SUV,I traded my '06 RAV 4 which I bought new for a new '17 Rav 4.  I bought the new car based on my experience with the old one which was excellent.  We've had great luck with   all of our Toyota cars and will definitely buy Toyota again.
"05 15, 2017",Its a very nice car for the price.,Its a very nice car for the price. Its very balanced and comfortable and the awd is a very nice feature for the pacific nw .
"05 14, 2017",Excellent Vehicle,"We got the base model LE and it came with great standard safety features including Smart Stop Technology, backup camera, and lane departure alert."
"05 14, 2017",Excited to Own Another Toyota,Love the comfortable ride and looking forward to the better gas mileage! This is my 5th Toyota that I have purchased.
"05 13, 2017",Downsized from Toyota Sienna and love it.,"Love our navigation system, blue tooth, handling, our leather seats, to mention a few. After owning vans for the last 30 plus years, we were wondering if a smaller vehicle would work for us. We just love our new car."
"05 12, 2017",Love the Rav4,"The Rav4 is an excellent vehicle, this being my third one. It is comfortable and reliable especially for long distance."
"05 11, 2017",RAV4 LE no-frills comfort and utility,"My RAV4 LE is a basic model that still provides a reasonably comfortable and quiet ride for an AWD. I did not want to pay for so-called luxury features, and found a great deal during April's $2000 cash back sale. As a senior, I wanted easy access, safety, and reliability which the RAV4 LE provided over other small SUV's."
"05 11, 2017",Love having a Toyota back!,This is a very comfortable and stylish small SUV.  Just slightly more room than a car yet giving you the great car type gas mileage.  Feels great to be back in a Toyota again!!!!
"05 10, 2017",Family Favorite,"It's hard not to love a RAV4...and this year's model is improved over the past with its wider wheelbase, smoother ride and ease of collapsing the back seats. We love its versatility for riding, hauling, and parking. And our local deal gave us an offer we couldn't refuse! We shopped around, but RAV4 was top choice for us."
"05 10, 2017",I feel safe and comfortable,"overall, reliability and comfort are good, looks great..  I wish it got better gas mileage but for the size, not much better out there!"
"05 10, 2017",Liking it!,"I've only had the RAV4 hybrid for 10 days, but I've been happy with everything about it so far.  I've driven a little over 700 miles of city, freeway, mountain highway and back country gravel roads while getting 35.1 MPG.  I really like the feature that detects pedestrians that I might not see otherwise and the feature that keep separation between my vehicle and the one in front of me.  So far, I'm really liking it!"
"05 10, 2017",RAV4 is the best car I've ever owned!,Really made a great  Choice with this Toyota RAV4! It's  Smooth to drive. Very  quiet and has so much space very  roomey. It's has a look of an very  expensive brand on the outside the  design is perfect  and stylish!
"05 10, 2017",Stylish and sleek,The crossover vehicle I just purchased is very modern and hip and totally makes driving enjoyable again.
"05  9, 2017","Sleek, Stylish -- Perfect","I downsized from a 2013 Toyota Sienna (family of 6) to a 2017 Rav4 (seats 5).  Although it's one less seat, I am very happy with it. The interior is very sleek and stylish, the seats are black leather (which many of them come with cloth seats) and very comfortable -- nice back support. The back seats can incline or be laid down for storage. I enjoy all of the safety features. Nice stereo system. I'm starting to feel my age again and not like a ""mom"". Love it!"
"05  9, 2017",Kari Harris,love it and so smooth of a ride. never had a Toyota before and just love it . handles so easy and great on gas and easy to use for shopping and having passengers
"05  7, 2017",Great car for anyone to use.,I love everything about this car. From the features it has like reverse camera and lane sensor to the Bluetooth radio. I love how comfortable it is and how cheap the gas is.
"05  6, 2017",Excellent car,Very impressed with exterior and VERY comfortable ride. Controls and features are easy to use (and figure out ).
"05  6, 2017",technologically smart car for a babyboomer,"We are very pleased with the decision to purchase RAV4 EXL 2017 . The deciding point were the built in safety features, beautiful extetior and roomier interior. My husband us a diehard fan of toyota RAV4. Our previous car was also rav4. The old RAV 4 is still in avery good running condition and we decided to donste it to a charity"
"05  4, 2017",Amazing,It's smooth and runs well. I save money on gas and it's not a hybrid. It's easy to clean and it has many safety features.
"05  4, 2017",2017 RAV4,It is so easy to get into & out of.  The beep from the lane changer is a little surprising especially when I didn't think I was drifting.  Love the auto headlights.  The interior is very user friendly.  Everything is within reach.  There are cup holders & bottle holders.  Still getting used to the backup camera.  I feel very secure in this vehicle.  So nice ti have hands free phone for when I need it.  Great sound system & lots of air bags.
"05  3, 2017",First new car I've  owned,I love the  way it performs  and all the safety features it has. like the front and rear parking sonar
"05  3, 2017",most important decision I have ever made.,"I bought the RAV4. it  is the  most important t decision I have ever made.
it drives very smooth. great value."
"05  2, 2017",Rav4 Platinum,"I purchased this car for a great price! Its comes fully loaded and very stylish! This site helped me get the BEST,  plus I negotiated. Im happy!!"
"05  2, 2017",Offers a smooth ride with great gas mileage,Great family car. Very spacious. The new design is very elegant. Toyota is a very reliable car make and this car really shows why.
"05  1, 2017",Purchased a Rav 4,"Very comfortable, well appointed, very suitable for Upstate NY weather conditions.
Had excellent assistance throughout purchase experience"
"05  1, 2017",Happy Rav driver,"Our family has 4 Toyotas and we have loved them all. This is the first Rav but like all the others, it is a great car."
"05  1, 2017",Not all changes are positive,"I also own a 2010 RAV 4, which I love.  Lots of upgrades with the electronics on the 2017.  The backup camera is nice, the radar guided cruise is a blessing and a curse.  The lane indicator is just annoying.  I like that the spare is inside the car.  I DO NOT like that the rear door is now a hatch rather than a door.  No more closing the door with your hands full.  

The interior seems a bit plasticy/cheap."
"05  1, 2017",Love my RAV4,Haven't bought a car in 17 years and finally not the bullet and bought a New RAV4 and I love it. I look forward to many adventures I'll have with my new RAV4. There is plenty of room to but my bike in the back of the Rav4  without taking the front wheel off. As well as plenty of room for camping gear! Very happy with my purchase!
"04 30, 2017",Toyota is Toyota,"I wanted to buy a car and I was hesitant between Toyota RAV4 , Nissan Rouge, Jeep Cherokee, and I bought Toyota at the end , it is better"
"04 30, 2017",Best engineered car I've ever owned.,My wife and I love this car and often fight over who's going to do the driving..Don't know how reliable it will be but being the owner of a previous  Toyota I'm sure it will be very reliable.
"04 29, 2017",The best SUV,This is the best SUV. This is our 3 car that we purchased and we are so happy with our new car. The car isn't too big that what we wanted to buy. Before buying check the futures for the car
"04 27, 2017",Great SUV,"We had never bought a Toyota before and were pleasantly surprised at all the features for the money. It is an excellent ride, looks stylish, and was a great value for the money. It lacks a little in performance, but gets us where we are going, and saves us fuel costs over the Explorer which we used to drive. We like the 2 year 24 month free maintenance with purchase and are looking forward to many years of care free driving."
"04 26, 2017",Stylish,"Teach W. At the Owings Mills location really worked hard for me to get into my RAV4, She was extremely knowledgeable, patient and caring, about the vehicle. I know I wore her out with questions and she answered every one. Teah W. Made me feel like it was about me and not making a sale. 10 all across the board, thanks a bunch Teah W."
"04 26, 2017",Great car!,"Comfort, convenience and wonderful adaptable technology creates a safe and high performance ride.  I love the galactic agua/black.

"04 26, 2017",I am enjoying the Rav4,It is so much easier to get in and out of.  It is so comfortable  to drive.  I love the color and the ease in driving.  Driving home was great and easy.
"04 25, 2017",Too new to articulate,"I only have about 165 miles on my new RAV4 Ltd. so far but ""so far, so good"" is all I can say.  I have looked at RAV4's for several years and I was finally ready to purchase since I was gifting my Solara to my grandson for college graduation in May.  The reviews in Consumer Reports and from friends that own one was good enough for me to buy one...looking forward to many good years and miles in my RAV4 Ltd."
"04 25, 2017",Love!!,I love the Toyota Rav 4. I originally went in to look at the 2017 Highlander with 3rd row seating. I didn't like it as it seemed hard to get to the back row without the captain chairs. To go to that model it was out of my budget. With the third row seating there wasn't much room to place anything in the back area. So I decided the Rav 4 was a better fit for my needs.
"04 24, 2017",Toyota Rav-4 2017,"Toyota makes the best car i have ever owned, I have TWO Rav-4  1- 2003 and now a 2017"
"04 22, 2017",2017 toyota Rav4 Limited,"Traded a 2014 Rav4 Limited for the additional TSS-P safety features on the 2017 version.  Really love the radar cruise control, and the additional insulation to quiet the ride! Still disappointed that leather interior is not offered."
"04 22, 2017",Our new Rav/4,"The Rav/4 has all the features we were looking for in a new SUV.   The standard safety features, such as lane departure and distance to obstacles/vehicles directly in front of you will prove to be valuable.   I especially like the eco mode that works to save fuel.   We've only owned for a couple days, but we are certain we will continue to love it"
"04 22, 2017",Have owned many Toyotas.,"This is the 7th Toyota I have bought new. 
I have always been very satisfied with them & my 2017 Rave 4 XLE is no exception. Superior quality.



























this is"
"04 22, 2017",Awsome inside and out,We bought our RAV 4 for many reasons after comparing it to other similar sized SUVs. We loved the feel and handling of it on the road. The interior offered comfortable seating and lots of leg room in back seat as well as front. They had wonderful colors to choose frm and the exterior style was attractive. Also the safety technology was amazing.
"04 22, 2017",Happiness,Love the color and the way it drives.  I feel very safe and secure in the car because I am sitting up high and can see
"04 21, 2017",I love my new Rav4!,"Toyotas are amazing and the Rav4 is no exception. Even Honda Laura on Youtube found the Rav4 to be sleek, comfortable, and well-designed in comparison to the Honda CRV. I personally find the both the exterior and interior design of the Rav4 to be better than the CRV. I own the SE model and I am glad I waited for that design (rather than the LE). It has many added features. This is the best car I have ever owned!"
"04 21, 2017",Another great Toyota,We love our Toyotas & look forward to driving our current reliable Toyotas & purchasing more Toyotas in the future.
"04 21, 2017",Rav 4 is awesome,"Great handling, comfortable, affordable, reliable.   Great in snow too!  

I have had four Ravs. I just helped my mother purchase her first one."
"04 21, 2017",Third RAV4,While I have had my new 2017 Toyota RAV4 for only a very short period of time I am extremely impressed with it.  This is the 3rd new RAV4 that I have purchased and find this new one as the very best.  Of course it is my first Hybrid model but the Safety package is outstanding.  The added horse power provides quick acceleration and the ride is much softer than previous RAV4's that I have owned.  The cabin is quiet offering a very pleasant interior environment for conversation or listening to the radio.  I have already advised several friends to consider exploring purchasing a 2017 RAV4.
"04 21, 2017",2017 RAV4 good buy,"great value for the money, like all the new safety features that were made standard, solid built car."
"04 20, 2017",Rav/REVs,"Things were going great until I had some tire issues only a week into leasing this car.
Other than than, gas mileage great for such a big car, it feels very safe, I like being a bit higher than a sedan but not too much, more room for my kids and dog in the back!"
"04 19, 2017",dash clock,"can anyone tell me how to set the instrument clock ??
its one pain in the BUTT.. even the sales manager could not say how to get it off army time 
CAN Anyone HELP 
Thanks John Zeman"
"04 15, 2017",Excellant Value and Safety!,I'm am very impressed with the Rav4. Excellent safety features standard and a great value for your money. This is my first Toyota and I am very surprised how much I love this vehicle. I have owned many makes in the past and this is by far one of my favorites. Its a great ride the safety features like lane departure are great they alert you but are not annoying like other makers alerts. The back up camera is easier for me to understand than other cars I have had. So impressed!
"04 14, 2017",Mrs. & Mrs.,"Outstanding experience!  All employees at the Braintree Dealership were extremely professional and helpful.  Would highly recommend - very pleasant non-stressful
experience."
"04 14, 2017",Robert Simms,Just bought car on 4-12-2017 havent owned it long enough to comment on its reliabilty but I fully expect it to be great....real nice car. Had to give it a rating to submit.
"04 13, 2017",sharp,everybody should experience a rav4
"04 13, 2017",Love the vehicle,"Only negatives are with the interior. Wish there had been more of a choice of fabric color.
Also, need more room for small incidentals, like the Camry has..."
"04 12, 2017",Most reliable car,Good decision I have made about selecting car and dealers sbip good salesperson Sunil I me at Brandon toyota
"04 11, 2017",Great New Car,"After having my Jeep for almost 8 years, it was finally time for a new car. I had been looking for a while and fell in love with the RAV4. So far it has been an amazing car. I love the features from the backup camera, lane detection, and the great gas mileage for an SUV. Could not have picked a better, more stylish new ride."
"04 10, 2017",Very well equipped car,"I am impressed by the fact that Toyota cares enough of its customers to provide them with all safety features as a standard, rather than reserve those features for only the high-priced models"
"04  9, 2017",Good ride,Love the hatchback touch opener & sun roof design
"04  8, 2017",Getting used to a new car,Had Toyota's in he past. Changed to Ford . Now back to Toyota. I like it. We also have a 2005 Toyota Solara Convertible. It is the nicest convertible on the street. We are sorry that Toyota stopped making them. I'm sure we would have bought another Solara convertible
"04  7, 2017",Pretty car,First computer car We have owned!Like the black interior &the white outside color combination. First new car. We have had in a long time
"04  6, 2017",my 4th Toyota,"perfect size for me, handles great and good gas mileage"
"04  6, 2017",Toyota Rav4,"I purchased a new Toyota Rav4 from Mr.David Ho, he is great business person and he explained to my and my wife everything about our investment and we understood everything,  we would like to say thank you to  Mr  David Ho and we rating  him with  (A+)"
"04  5, 2017",2017 RAV 4,Just upgraded from a 2013 RAV 4.  The\is the best car that I've owned! The forward visibility is beyond compare!  I love the standard safety features that Toyota has installed in this vehicle.
"04  4, 2017",BEST car I ever owned,"I highly recommend the Toyota Rav4. Especially with all the great new safety features. Safe, fun to drive and looks like a million bucks! I love it :)"
"04  4, 2017",I love my rav4,"Great car , very happy with all the options it comes with. The ability to be awd unless 50/50 4wd is needed is a great attribute"
"04  3, 2017",PERFECT!,"Couldn't be happier with vehicle.  Handles better than expected.  Very solid vehicle and ride is SWEET!!!  Bigger inside than I thought and the 2017 style is beyond expectations.  Glad I gave it a chance and it is just the perfect purchase for me. BEST overall purchase experience to date!  Paul Costouros was very thorough, patient and above all very  knowledgeable with all aspects of the process.  The process was seamless and smooth as silk from start to finish.  Jack Prato was great with explaining the financing process and I was in and out in no time.  I received an excellent deal for my new vehicle and very pleased that I took my friends advice to go see Paul at Bredemann Toyota for my new purchase.  Forget the rest...I FOUND THE BEST!!!  I am looking forward to my new dealership relationship and couldn't be happier with my purchase and being a part of the Bredemann Family."
"04  1, 2017",Can't wait to drive it more,"first Toyota and can't wait to drive it
heard lots of good comments, reviews about the brand
comfortable and good price"
"04  1, 2017",Love it!,"Great smooth ride, trust it to get me through the snow, love the look of it. Love the back up camera and that I can connect my phone via Bluetooth through the radio. And a moonroof- perfect!"
"03 31, 2017",2017 Rav 4,Very nice car and with the new security features it worth every dollar. I love it and my family too. I recommend this car with no doubt
"03 30, 2017",Toyota Rav4,Very smooth to handle and comfortable in all aspects.. powerful and good handling. I liked interior design very much.
"03 29, 2017","Excellent, comfortable and with the technology","Before buying a car I always see the Reviews, but when driving I reaffirm a comfortable car, hard body, good power and above all highly efficient in consumption."
"03 28, 2017",Owner,This is the second Rav4 my family has purchased and we love it.  I do wish there were more cup  holders
"03 27, 2017",The Car Of The Future,I love my new Rav4. I wish it still came in a V6. But overall I love everything about it and the new body shape. I am very impress with all the bells and whistles this car has.
"03 26, 2017",Rav4 is a beautiful vehicle,We last owned a Rav three years ago.  The changes made to the design and safety wowed us.  Such a classy looking vehicle.
"03 26, 2017","A Real Gem in Style, Safety and Comfort","I just purchased a Toyota RAV4 SE and couldn't be happier. The safety features  and solid feel are excellent. The comfort and performance are also fantastic! You really feel you are driving a super high end car in all aspects. To be honest there are 3 things that I was disappointed with--my car had the Entunes Connected GPS Navigation System.  Very much a let down in what you would expect- no way to get a map showing as you drove or even when getting directions. You got arrows and voice but no map. Also, no way to get the Entune apps promoted and showing. I called Entunes, Toyota, the GPS company and they all said those things not able to work in this model navigation system plus, you cannot install the Premium Entunes system to replace the connected one as hardware not included. The map was important to me, so I had to go to outside vendor and have a brand name navigation system installed. The second feature, no integration of garage door opener into the car in any way. I have to carry my opener with me. The outside vendor said they possibly could add something for several hundred dollars but after the navigation change out, definitely could not justify spending hundreds more just to not carry my garage door opener. The 3rd things, the splash up is atrocious. My car is white and after driving a few miles in rainy weather, the top surface of the back bumper was black, along with the entire rear liftgate and window, coated in mud film.  I had mud flaps installed by the dealer and happy to say--excellent value for the money, the rear of the Rav stays clean now. They look sharp and are a solid addition.  I also had the side mouldings put on, good additional protection and really improves the appearance of the vehicle. After those modifications, I feel I am driving a top car in comfort, safety, appearance and reliability.  As far as safety features, Toyota now equips their Ravs with just about everything you could think of and it works so well.  This car is luxury in safety features, comfort, reliability and appearance. Still have a constant smile on my face as I drive it. One other things, Toyota now has as standard the type of shifting system that cars like the Prius have had before, the anticipated shifting where you don't even feel the car shift, leads to much better fuel consumption, better ride and performance and more steady acceleration when you need to increase your speed, like when entering a freeway.  By the way, if you happen to be in the Oregon area, a dealer in Hillsboro, Royal Moore Toyota, no personal connection, has a unique 20,000 mile Power Train Warranty, along with making a car buying experience  so enjoyable and one in which you end up with friends, in every department. The personal care and recognition from your first day on is exceptional!"
"03 26, 2017",Great vehicle,"I have owned this vehicle for about 2 months and miss some of the features on my previous vehicle, but am overall well pleased with it.  Love the blind sport mirrors, lane beepers, and the automatic slowing feature while in cruise control"

"03 25, 2017",Great Car!,"The Toyota RAV4 is a really fun car to drive, and it's loaded with safety features!  It's all wheel drive SUV, which is nice because you sit higher than a car.  It's a good car to drive in the winter because of its traction with the all wheel drive.  It handles really well, too.  I highly recommend it!"
"03 24, 2017",Toyota RAV,Excellent performance and great handling feeling.. Everything perfect for me. My first car and i loved it.
"03 24, 2017",RAV4 great car!,Beautiful car with great options! Love the safety features! Great styling! Very smooth ride! Awesome color. Galactic blue!
"03 24, 2017",Dean Bunch,"We are very happy with our Toyta RAV 4,it is our second one, they are very comfortable and reliable.Toyota has the options and technology we are looking for.I would recomend Toyota to all my friends and family."
"03 24, 2017",Awesome car for student driver...,We picked this car for a new driver in the household.  we really liked all the safety features it offers and makes us feel a bit better about letting them drive on their own.  The safety features was definitely the selling point.
"03 23, 2017",I just bought the car and l love everything about,"I first nice car I have not drove.it is beautiful, with a great technology update that every one will wish on a car."
"03 20, 2017",Seek to have this be a terrific vehicle.,Looking forward to a wonderful experience. It is a new SUV for us & we are anxious to have fun & pleasure with it.
"03 20, 2017",HAPPY WITH MY TOYOTA RAV4 2017,"LOVELY AN ECONOMY CAR, THE PEOPLE FROM THIS DEALER SI SO NICE AND HELPFUL!
Y RECOMMEND 100% PEOPLE TO COME TO THIS DEALER"
"03 19, 2017",Its my 3rdd Rav so you can see I love it.,"My only complaint was I can't reach the rear hatch back to close it, should of got an automatic closer. Wasn't aware I would be too short."
"03 19, 2017",2017 Rav4,"The only thing Toyota got wrong on this model is the alignment of the sunvisor & rearview mirror. You can't lower the visor & then push it forward & up to block sun, but maintain visibilty. This is due to the visor hitting the rearview mirror. A pain for taller people like me!"
"03 19, 2017",Great 2017 RAV 4,"This is my 2nd RAV4, I also owned a 2010, they are a very reliable vehicle. They are very comfortable and fun to drive."
"03 16, 2017",Great car,"I've only had the vehicle a week, but I love it! Handles well, gets great gas mileage. I only wish the passenger seat had electric adjustments, instead of manual."
"03 14, 2017","Excellent, reliable vehicle!","Very pleased with this vehicle. Everything about it is absolutely great! I'm looking forward to 4 wheel drive, especially with recent weather. Overall very satisfied!!!"
"03 14, 2017",Amazing vehicle,Not one single complaint! I am beyond happy about my vehicle and can't wait to continue driving it for years to come!
"03 14, 2017",Loving my car,Was very happy with the comfort and ease if driving this car. And thank goodness for the all wheel drive during this march snow
"03 13, 2017",Most impressive SUV I have had the pleasure of dri,The RAV4 surpassed the expectations I had for this small SUV. I was expecting something good and was really impressed with what I received.
"03 12, 2017",Rav 4 -- the second one we've owned.,"Very nice car. Good gas mileage.  This is our second Rav 4. Traded in a 2013 for the Platinum series .  It has many of the same features you would find on the Highlander, but is a bit smaller with better gas mileage. The foot sweep to open the rear hatch is great. And the heated steering wheel is a welcomed feature living in Wisconsin. Could have a little smoother ride, but overall great."
"03 12, 2017",Platinum Trim Level Rocks!,"Well, we have one reasonably long trip and 1000 miles on it, and thought it was time to provide at least the initial impressions.  Let me begin by saying I'm a little disappointed in the gas mileage (approx. 27mpg on the trip and about 22mpg locally) but that from a perspective of a Prius owner that is used to getting 50+mpg, so temper that.  To go along with that, the engine is just a little anemic; I wish there had been a larger 4 cyl or a small 6 cyl engine.  The seats are firm (and we both love the Sof-Tex in lieu of leather), providing what both my wife and I feel is excellent support, and the car is relatively firmly sprung, at least by the standards of a Prius.  It felt truly excellent on the 500+ mile trip.  There are amenities galore and safety features that I have just begun to explore.  I will write a follow-up review further down the road when I have more miles on it and more understanding of what everything does.  So far, it is an excellent, comfortable automobile, and we both have fallen in love with its ride and its comfort.  I must say, having never had one, the heated steering wheel rocks!"
"03 10, 2017","Reliable, Great safety features","Had a 2014, but the new safety features pushed me into trading for a new one. The adaptive Cruise Control is great and the lane assist."
"03  6, 2017",You Can't Beat the Reliability & Style for the $$,"I come from a high-performance car family (Porsche, Triumph, Jaguars, Vipers, etc) and to me, this is the best looking,  best performing SUV on the market. I've had two Rav4s previously and will never settle for anything else when it comes to buying an SUV."
"03  2, 2017",RAV4 - second one even better than the first,I traded a 2009 Toyota RAV4 in for a 2017 RAV4 and live my new car. Drives so smooth and for a 4 cylinder it had plenty of get up and go.  Very smooth ride even over constructions area rough rodes.  Hope to keep this one for another 125K miles.
"02 27, 2017",Great Car,Perfect vehicle for someone who needs a small SUV loaded up with all the tech and safety features. Gas mileage is great and my dealer experience was superb
"02 22, 2017",paper work,"got a 2017 rav 4 xle and it did not even have compass.over $30,000 and no compass.Had to pay over $300 to get one. How sad is that??"
"01 27, 2017",A very good car I love it.,My sales person Ricardo Tuazon at Rte 440 Hudson Toyota Jersey City NJ.  He's very knowledgeable and  provides good suggestion in getting a new car. I will recommend him to my friends and other relatives.
"01 26, 2017",Best buying experience ever,"The two toned interior leather is amazing looking. Dealer I purchase from is Big Two Toyota. My sales rep was ""Griz"" Griffin. This was my most pleasant purchase of a new car ever. I'm 67. I've purchased 5 new cars. This dealership and honest retail experience was awesome!"
"01  9, 2017",One disappointment,"This is our seconD RAV 4, had a2011 and have a 2014 both new. Biggest probem w have had is the rough ride, they have no suspension for rough roads.  Hit a bump and you feel like you have bottomed out. Need to smooth out the suspension and have a replacement kit to fixit."
"11 29, 2016",Happy Customers,"In April of 2016 we purchase a Toyota Rav4, with the help of salesman Tom Vosnos.  We loved the new Rav4, so when we needed a second car, we went back to Bredemann Toyota and purchase a second Rav4 (2017) with Tom's help.  We are very happy with both vehicles.  Great car, great service."
"11  2, 2016",The RAV4 is a good vehicle.,"A friend and I each bought a RAV4. Overall it is a good vehicle. However, the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I've experienced."
"09  1, 2016",Great car,"Have only had the car for a week, but love the performance when in traffic, comfortable seats, nice design.  Had one in the past and find this one even better."
"11  6, 2023",Reliable transportation,"Bought new in 2018, have replaced battery and tires in 40000 miles. Been reliable but expected better gas mileage. 29 mpg hwy only 16 mpg in town."
"11  6, 2023",Love my Rav4,"Looked for a used Rav for 2 yrs.  I finally found one online, lady owned. I contacted her, we went down to Midland, purchased it  plus it happened to be my favorite color.  I love it and also made a new friend."
"08 28, 2023",RAV4s are the best cars ever.,I picked up a 2018 Limited for under $25K with 30K miles in like new condition. These cars are amazing. The engineering is as reliable as they come. It drives like it's on rails and the gas mileage isn't too bad with the powerful 4-cylinder engine. I also have a 2019 Highlander and I love them both. Toyota makes the best cars for fair prices.
"08 21, 2023",2018 Rav4 XLE reliable and maintenance free,I owned my former Toyota for 14 years and expect to to own my 2018 Rav4 XLE for at least that long. I've not had any problems in the 5 years that I've owned it. The SUVs appearance both inside and out is what makes it an attractive car. It has been reliable and maintenance free. I would buy another Rav4 when this one wears out in 10 years.
"06 24, 2023",Take care of it and it will take care of you.,"The 2AR-FE engine (in my 2015 and 2018 models) and they U760E transmission are durable classics. That same combination is featured in Camrys and Lexus 250s of the time.

Oil changes are engineered for 5,000 miles (don't do 10k oil changes if you want your car to last more than 150,000 miles or to maximize resale price!). Transmission fluid should be at 60k unless you tow or subject it to extreme driving conditions, then it's more frequent.

The weak link is their infotainment, but I'd rather have my kids in a safe car rather than a safe DJ booth.

Properly maintained Toyota Rav4s last for ages. Oil and transmission fluid are cheap compared to engine or transmission replacement.

Pro tip, buy one made in Japan with a lot of service records and timely maintenance."
"02 27, 2023",Toyotas last and everyone knows this. Rav 4 too.!!,"It rides great,the seats are very comfortable and has plenty of leg room. It also sits high enough off the ground for easy access.  Good gas mileage too. Sporty looking."
"07 17, 2022",Most reliable Ugly SUV,"Most reliable ugly SUV out here. It will always start and take you from point A to point B and C… but it ugly as s….LOL. I don’t know what did they have in mind when they designed this car. Especially the front is just very very ugly.
Very uncomfortable inside and pretty weird interior design.
It’s a perfect car for a college student who wants to move around.
It’s not great on mileage. I would have expected much better from a 2.5.
But if you want to feel good about what you are driving then this is not the car for you. I had it for one year and got rid of it after my son kept complaining about how ugly it is….LOL
I’m glad Toyota rethought it over with the design of the new ones."
"05  6, 2022",Enjoy the Best Small SUV on the market.Great SUV!,"I purchased new 4 years ago.  What a ride very comfortable and high safety ratings.  Cheap matinence tires, oil changes and tire rotations.  Toyota  is a top brand and worth considering.   I got the LE model nice car but missing a few toys like heated seats, sat radio and and fog lights.  

Recommend getting the Toyota RAV4 Limited that car is fully loaded.



Pros
1. great radio
2. high gas mileage
3. Toyota reliablity
4. high ride visiblity

Cons 
1. Car collects lots of dust on dash.
2. poor vision from rear, need to use side mirrors"
"04 26, 2022",Rav4 Great SUV,"Owned a Rav4 2007 and it was very dependable so bought another one used year 2018. Great safety features, handles well, gas mileage is as advertised. Roomy interior. The headlights have been something to get used to as the illuminated area is different from the 2007 model."
"05 25, 2021",Looking Forward to Another 15-20 Years My Car!,I love the sporty look and how it handles.  I feel very safe driving it and it's nice having all the safety features that my previous car didn't.
"05 22, 2021",So far as reliable as my previous 2004 Highlander,"Great all around vehicle. Economical, comfortable. Great on trips, great for local and shopping use. Convenience features add to the safety of the vehiclr. Hold child seats well. We feel safe."
"05 19, 2021",Lacking some expected options,"Didn't even occur to me that it didn't have a CD player; disappointed after I bought it. Also doesn't have rain-sensing windshield wipers; I understand that I can't add  them. Other than those two items, it's a great vehicle. Does have a bit of road noise. I've never had an SUV before, having driven Camrys and Avalons. Have had Toyotas exclusively since 1977. Wouldn't have anything else."
"05 16, 2021",Excelente camioneta,"Este automóvil satisfazio todas mis necesidades, es una camioneta espaciosa, su malesta es grande y tiene fuerza, estoy muy contenta con la adquisición.
Recomendaría a otras personas su compra"
"05 14, 2021",Very comfortable!,It is very comfortable as compared to what I was driving. The car is quiet and very smooth. The Bluetooth is a nice to have! I was worried my kids weren’t going to have enough space but so far so good.
"05 12, 2021",great dependable car,"I like this car it has a comfortable ride , good leg room , good on gas and enough room to hull things and tow my smaller boat"
"04 11, 2021",Many options. Best value for your buck!,"This car is very roomy(plenty of space for hauling groceries, etc...), comfortable seats, plenty of leg room, many safety features, great on gas mileage. And very sporty looking."
"03 28, 2021",Most reliable car I have owned so far .,"Car is absolutely  great I am in love with it , I am so happy I stopped in. The car has a great interior and exterior ."
"03 24, 2021",look forward to many years of owning this vehicle.,"this car has everything i was looking for in a vehicle comfort, plenty of room,,  smooth ride, looks good, plenty of options and safety features"
"03 21, 2021",Most reliable car I ever owned,"This car is one of the most reliable car I ever owned,never given me a problem 
Very comfortable driving ,and I love the heated seats"
"03  5, 2021",Best SUV,I love this car. I have had other SUVs and this one is the best. So much comfort when I drive an hour to work. Very roomie for everything I need it for. So happy I switched from GM cars to Toyoto
"03  2, 2021",noisy,Would be fun to drive if there wasn't so much road noise and if you could occasionally rest your arm on the center console.  Michelin tires would help the noise. Cup holders are almost useless.  Great mechanically and very dependable.
"02 27, 2021",Hope this one is as reliable as the ones I have ow,"Bought this for my small frame wife who loves the vehicle. We have owned several Toyotas’ in the past and hope this one is as reliable as our other ones. The RAV4 Limited is just a little small for me, 6’2” and 275lbs but with seats all the way back it will work. Look forward to many years of service from it."
"02 26, 2021",First time owner of SUV.,"While searching for a new vehicle for my girlfriend I decided a new purchase was in my near future. She was set on an SUV and I was willing to help her search. After driving a Buick Encore, Nissan Rouge, Subaru Forester and Outback, Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, and others she settled on the  Outback Limited (2019 w/19,000 miles) .
 
I on the other hand really liked the RAV4 (2018 w/8,000 miles). Ride may be a little nicer on the Outback but it was more costly and a bit bigger vehicle. The RAV4 XLE suited my needs and wants and gave me a few extras I was not have looking for. I am a bit partial to Toyota due to the great experience I have had with my 2013 Tundra. 

I have put about 1000 miles on the RAV4 and have rated comfort 4 stars because I think the seat is a little stiff but I do think it is starting to fit me better. Performance is also 4 stars but I think most cars are under powered as I started driving in 1974, ahh, muscle cars. Exterior styling also received 4 stars because I think most SUV's look about the same. 

Like the RAV4 much better than my previous daily driver (Nissan Altima) and hope my 5 star reliability rating doesn't disappoint. As it is based on reviews and my experience with my Tundra."
"02 22, 2021",Happy with my Rav4,"I love my 2018 Rav4. Although I’m very pleased with it, there are a few things I think need improvement. For example, I know is a 4 cylinder, but could use more power; the cups area are not well placed; should come with lights turning on when car is; the middle compartment is very weak;  the air conditioner there’s no vent for the back row only the front and there are no speakers for the back it would have been nice front & back."
"02 22, 2021",Great car,Great car with a great warranty to back it up. Very pleased with the car and how it has preformed so far. Thank you very much
"02 20, 2021",Most reliable I owned.,This car met all my needs. its a very reliable. I had  done my research on this vehicle and I heard a lot of good reviews. which lead me to buy this car.
"02 12, 2021",Best maintenance cost in the long run,"This is not the bigger, more comfortable or speedier SUV in its category, but it is the best value for money. If you follow the maintenance schedule, you won't worry about anything else. And the maintenance is one of the cheapest around. If you like to save money, this is the best choice."
"01 30, 2021",Love love love the RAV4,A very sleek appearance inside and out . Drives smooth great value seats are comfortable. Electronically awesome . Roomy trunk size is awesome . Love it !
"01 25, 2021",Nice car,My dad really like  the Toyota RAV4. We test drive it and it awesome .The inside was excellent. New features were add. feel comfortable and end up getting the car.
"01 12, 2021",Very great consumer car for first time car buyer,"This is a ver great commuter, this is NOT a luxury car but it definitely doesn’t feel like the up most of cheap. The interior coming from a “car” person is pretty good like above average  I have the LE version (base model) and the cotton seats are extremely great after 3 years of use they held up good. The floor mats are decent the plastic rubber type stuff on the dash and steering wheel held up the gps screen is really good. The exterior is something I wouldn’t expect from Toyota they really try to make the base model not look like a base model and it worked the only problem I have is the lights there bulb lights but they barely work sometimes I wish they could be a little brighter and raised up more and sometimes people flash there lights at me thinking I have my brights on when it sometimes feels I don’t even have my lights on. Now let’s talk about performance. This is not a performance car but I wish it had a little more power just a tad bit more great gas mileage but sometimes when I go on highways especially if the on ramp is short I kinda have to gas it I don’t know if it’s a Florida thing but everyone here seems to go 85 90 and I do to."
"12 23, 2020","Great SUV so far, no problems after 16,500 miles","Very roomy for 4 adults. Lots of leg room in the rear seats.  Ride is soft but handles well in all types of weather and road conditions.  My only disappointment is the cheap materials used inside of the car.  Seats are black nylon feel fabric (hate it), lots of plastic, no soft touches anywhere. The shifter is the worst, the passenger can easily hit and put in a different gear.(has happened to me) on the tollway!!! Hope to keep for a few more years and look to upgrade - maybe toyota, or lexus. My RAV4 IS 2018."
"12 15, 2020",Happy RAV4 owner,"I recently purchased a RAV4. I am extremely happy with this purchase the vehicle checks all the boxes. I have long legs so it is extremely important that I am comfortable. This 2018 RAV4 is the perfect fit for me. It seems all of the newer models of SUV‘s are moving towards a taller console which I find to be very uncomfortable.  Features, handling, looks, affordability, safety features, this vehicle has it all."
"12 14, 2020",Love sitting higher driving than my previous sedan,It has a smooth ride and great pick up. Haven’t had a back up camera before & really like it.  I also like that it has a CD player since most new cars don’t & I have a CD’s I still love to play.  I also like that it has a key instead of those silly fobs.  I see no point in them whatsoever and they are too easy to forget and take them somewhere else when you’re  in a different car.
"12  9, 2020",Most reliable car I have owned,This car meets all my needs and plots provisions are what I wanted in a car.I am and I will not hesitate to recommend it to anyone in need of a good car to drive.Thank you IRA Toyota for the excellent services

"09 20, 2020",Most comfortable ride I ever had,I love this car. It's my 3rd rav4 and most enjoyable by far. I needed more room and that's what I got. I love the new features in it
"09  8, 2020",Our favorite Toyota so far,"The size of the car is perfect, handles great on the road and has many nice safety features.  We found it unusual that with as many features as this car had, that there were no power seats.  The interior and exterior styling is a bit behind other car makes, although I have noted that the newer RAV4's have made many style updates.   We are considering trading in our Corolla for another RAV 4 next year."
"09  5, 2020",Toyota Camrys now Toyota RAV4,This car met my needs I like the suvs. I have only owned it for a few days but highly recommended in consumer reports. It is reasonably quiet and runs smoothly

I’ve already had to have front and back brake pads replaced.☹️"
"07 28, 2020",This product is worth buying,"Leasing this vehicle was the best decision  I have made for a long time. When my lease ends, I plan on leasing another. Fun vehicle to drive. The radar option is great for keeping safe distances."
"07 17, 2020",Americas most reliable auto vehicle,So far has been a pleasure to drive and hope it’s is as reliable as the experts say it is. Hoping for the best for many years
"07  2, 2020",I liked it very well!,"The RAV4 is a great car. It had everything that I wanted on it. The radio was not the best, but the mpg was great and the ride was comfortable!"

"05 30, 2020","Outstanding mechanically,  has too much road noise","My wife drives and likes only because of the size,  I would never buy a RAV4 again.  too much road noise and not comfortable on trips over an hour long.  Very dependable, economic, and looks nice."
"05 29, 2020",Absolutely love my RAV4,"This is my 2nd RAV4.  I drove my last one to the ground. It had 258,000 miles on it. I had very little work done to it. The breaks were only changed once.  If you want a reliable, low- maintenance, attractive vehicle, this is the one for you!"
"05 27, 2020",Feel so much more safe than I have before.,The RAV 4 has met all my needs and more. I am a grandmother and wanted a car that met my need for safety while carpooling my grand children. Love the safety features it gives me.
"05 19, 2020",Just bought it but very pleased so far.,Exactly what i was looking for.  I bought mine for traveling and vacations.  Plenty of room for all my essentials. I’d recommend this vehicle to anyone.
"05  5, 2020","So far so good, I love it.","Hmmm, I like the feel of it, I like the comfort. Even though EVERYONE told me to buy Toyota, the interior carpet seems cheep. I get that they are more about performance, that is why I bought this vehicle! But hey, I'm a woman who notices these things. I'm looking forward to having this SUV for many, many years! Thank you!"
"05  2, 2020",As long as my wife is happy,This one made my wife happy and gets her where she needs to go without any problem. It's got hook up with her son's phone also
"04 18, 2020",this is my 3rd Rav 4,"this vehicle has everything I want or need, it is my 3rd Rav 4 and have been pleased with all 3, the last 2 were purchased from this dealership"
"04 10, 2020",New to Toyota brand,"Going from a larger to a smaller Suv, i have adapted well , I love the color Ruby red pearl, happy with all the different functions and options as well as  the way it drives!"
"04  7, 2020",Great value for the price,"Being a long running Toyota family (a Corona, 2 Camry(s), 2 Tundra(s), and now the RAV4) since 1980 and having been pleased with all of them, we naturally stayed with the Toyota brand when purchasing a new car in 2018.  We have been very pleased with the RAV4, too.  Toyota is head and shoulders above other brands in their price range!"
"03 25, 2020",Perfect car for a perfect price,I am so in love with my vehicle. It has great gas milage compared to my past car and it is up to date with all of the preferences that I wanted.
"03 12, 2020",Sharp Compact SUV,Our 2018 Rav4 AWD  Limited is a very sharp looking car. It rides well for a small car but may not have the best overall ride in the compact SUV category. Toyotas have a great reliability record and our Rav4 is no exception.  Safety features are top notch.  Could use a heads up speedometer display and street sign recognition feature. Overall nice car.
"03 11, 2020",Best SUV for the Money.  I own Three Toyotas.,"I got rid of 3 Germans for 3 Toyotas.  It is the best thing I ever did concerning cars.  No more premium gasoline.  No more A & B services at extreme cost.  No more pandering service writers attempting to ""up the check"".  Free maintenance!  If you don't want it buy another.  They don't  cost $85,000."
"03 10, 2020",This is my fifth Toyota very reliable,So far great has not had any issues Rides well in comparison to other Toyatos that I hav e owned. Will consider upgrades in a he future Again rides great this is my example
"03  5, 2020",Reliable but boring at the same time!,"Can't go wrong with one of the best selling SUV in the world.  It's a great commute car that you can depend on it's reliability to get you from point A to point B without issue everyday with minimum maintenance.

On the cons side, I personally think it could have done much better with the odd interior design.  Such as triangle storage tray (WHY triangle??)  Storage area above glove compartment too shallow to put anything there.  Center cutout display used to have a digital clock but after the clock moved to the radio....it's just an empty black bar!

To me this car seems more like an unfinished project that several designs are not utilized or just half way done.

Another important factor to consider that many people left out when shopping for a car is the corporate.  Toyota corporate customer service is one of the worst amount the major manufactures, and I only wish I had known that before I made the purchase I would have go with Honda."
"02 19, 2020",Review new car,"So I have only had my car for one day,  but so far I like it.  I am still getting used to all of the electronic bells and whistles which I did not have on my old car.  Our sales rep Howard Cullen was very helpful in explaining everything and even Synced my phone so I could use it hands free in the car."
"01 22, 2020",I love this vehicle!,"This vehicle exceeded all expectations, and drove like a dream!  I was very impressed with the condition, and the design.
 I couldnt let this baby get away!!  I drove it home that day!🙂"
"01 18, 2020",Great SUV!,"This is a perfect SUV. Good size, decent gas mileage, looks sharp. I e owned 2 so far and they are reliable. You can trust them."
"01 10, 2020",Most reliable car,Very comfortable and luxurious car. Beautiful interior and very comfortable driving. I love this vehicle and very happy to own it . I recommend this vehicle for any one who is looking for a comfortable vehicle .
"01  9, 2020","2018 RAV4 LE Base Model 17,000 miles since new","Overall a Good car.  Lots of safety features standard (Lane Departure, Auto Safety Sense braking to avoid a impact, ect.)  A couple nit-pick dislikes such as I like Sport-Mode but have to turn back on each time the car is started, the sun visors do not slide to the rear when in use on side windows leaving a gap, cup holders.   Most things about the car I like.  Would purchase again (bought new and now at 17,000 miles)."
"12 29, 2019",Love the car,This vehicle met my needs with regard to price curb appeal and comfort. The safety features was more than expected. The color was very pretty and different
"12 20, 2019",Muy confiables,"Este es un auto extraordinario porque cumple con todas mis necesidades, es cómodo, económico, tiene un buen espacio y eso es algo que buscaba cuando compraba el auto.
En el puedo ir hacia mi trabajo así como en mis días libres irme de paseo. Me encanta"
"12 12, 2019",Dream Car,"My Rav4 drives smoothly. I love the ease with which it can be opened and closed! Jason Jutz was an awesome salesman! Thanks! We at enjoying everything about it, and my family and friends are anxious to see it!!!"
"12  9, 2019",The seatbelt is dangerously hard to operate,"When i try to buckle up my seat belt it takes a very long time because on my left side when i reach back to grab the seatbelt,  it is difficult, and when i reach the seat belt across me to buckle, i have to literally turn my entire body so my hand can reach the buckle that is very low and hard to get your hand in there.   I am sure that other rav4 owners have this problem.    There have been times that i gave up on buckling the seatbelt because i tried 3 or 4 times and gave up."
"11 30, 2019",Loved my matrix for 16 years now love my rav4,The rav4 is perfect for me and transporting my grandkids.  The trunk holds my husband’s very large walker.  The color is red and beautiful.  Love how the car handles.  Love 4 wheel drive which is my first time having this feature.
"11 17, 2019",Has 20000 miles on it and still runs like new,The car is very comfortable and has plenty of room. I love all the features the RAV4 offers.  Tho only thing I can say tat isn’t perfect is the acceleration.  It take a few seconds but it does go when you need it too.  Also transmission seems to react slow when you are stopping and then light changes and you accelerate it takes it a few seconds to realize you are going again
"10 29, 2019",I like my Toyota!,This is my first Toyota vehicle. My RAV4 has exceeded my expectations and I can highly recommend this vehicle to persons that are interested in having a quality car at a fair price.
"10 28, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,This car exceeds all my expectations.   Very comfortable even on long rides and very well appointed. I particularly like the cargo space after the seats are put down.
"10 27, 2019","Nice car, perfect for running around town",This is a good car. I have taken a couple of trips from Florida to Texas and it did very well. Mostly driving around town. It is very easy to park too.
"10 27, 2019",Its a nice car to drive.,"Its a very relabel and nice car, I relay enjoy having it. The dealership was too far from my home, but I am glad too the time to drive there and deal with his wonderful employees."
"10 23, 2019",Purchased to pull my 17ft camper.,"I love my Rav4 Adventurer model. Bought it to pull my travel trailer, but its my primary vehicle. Rides and handles great year round. Has all the bells and whistles."
"10 22, 2019","So far, I couldn’t be happier with my choice!","This car is very comfortable to drive! It handles well in city and highway conditions! I like the safety features of the vehicle! It is big enough to haul what we want (groceries, pets and luggage) and small enough to make parking easy!"
"10 22, 2019",I owned 3 Toyotas and have been happy with them al,The Rav4 is the perfect size for my needs. It has the ease of driving a sedan but  meets the about of space I need for transporting my materials.
"10 18, 2019",Just bought a 2918 RAV4,"Well, initial thoughts on owning a 2018 Toyota RAV4 LE.  The LE is base model and therefore not a lot in the way of frills/ luxury.  With that said it has comfortable seating with pretty good adjustability, backup camera and phone connectivity for hands free calling.  The ride is comfortable, it corners well and has a very tight turning radius.  The 2.5L engine is responsive with good pickup.  Cargo space is pretty large and the split rear seat gives flexibility.  It’s also nice that the rear seats fold down very flat.  I expect to get 250,000 + miles."
"10 13, 2019",Best car I have ever owned!,"Great, reliable vehicle.   Good gas mileage.  Comfortable.  The RAV4 fits two car seats in the backseat easily.  The trunk has good storage room.  The ride is smooth."
"10  9, 2019",Most beautiful car I've own,I like the way it rides.It handles really great.I like the color of the car with the interior.I really like the body still.I bought for my wife and she is happy
"10  8, 2019","Quiet, reliable, multifunctional","This car replaced a highlander in order to get better gas mileage but not sacrifice on leg room and space. It's a hybrid but still has plenty of get up n go.  Have put a trailer hitch on to haul bikes. Despite some customers complaints of integrating entune with an iphone, I have had no issues.  Happy customer."
"10  8, 2019",Rav4 AWD its the way to go,very comfortable and the performance is great in sport setting. I wanted white so I'm very happy. I really love the car and will take good care of it in the future.
"09 25, 2019",Love it!,"This car was used as a demo model, so it was technically a used car.  I drove it once and liked it immediately.  I think it's much more comfortable than other SUVs I drove and certainly more appealing.  There is plenty of leg room both front and back.  The outside mirrors have the smaller mirror to detect cars closer to you and really helps when transferring lanes.   I am not fond of the manual seat adjustment, however, that is a minor inconvenience.  The phone option is wonderful.  I love this vehicle."
"09 16, 2019",2nd RAV4,I love the RAV4 it is my second RAV4.  The one thing I don’t like if the side windows are wet or have condensation when you roll it down it never clears it.  Minor little thing wouldn’t make me not get another.
"09 16, 2019","Very sensible, very reliable","This car drives so, so well in bad weather and snow.  It’s an excellent med size suv with everything you need to stay alerted and safe.  Excellent sound system and hands free buttons. Nice looking vehicle. You’re smart to own this suv."
"08 30, 2019",This is the nicest car I have ever owned,"I have had this car for a year & I love it. I have the ruby red color which is beautiful. It shines in the sun. It has been very dependable. This is my first Toyota, but my daughter has had 2 which she also loves. My car has black leather interior which doesn’t show dirt & is easy to clean, but looks great."
"08 22, 2019",Nice design and quality all around.,First new car since 2000 so this RAV4 Rocks.....did a lot of research on other brands and this was our pick and the brand of Toyota is about as good as  you can get.
"08 19, 2019",My safety vehicle,I feel extremely safe when I am in my vehicle.  Safest car I have ever own.  I love my Rav4.  I highly recommend anyone who wants a safe vehicle to test drive the Rav4.
"08 17, 2019",Awesome vehicle!,"Vehicle has the following...stylish, spacious/comfortable, gas saver, drives great, great safety features & reliable. Price is affordable for its model/year and not to mention it holds its value."
"08 14, 2019","RAV4 is da best vehicle, runs smooth n saved gas","I purchased this 2018 Toyota RAV4 Le Reliable n saved gas, comfort inside, a lot of spaces.  I used it to commute from auburn to Leominster"
"08  1, 2019",Excellent automobile!,"This RAV4 is exactly what we need right now. It handles well, accelerates responsively, looks great, and although it is not the top trim level has a look and feel of quality."
"07 24, 2019",Very good,It’s met my needs we liked very much. Very smoothly drive. Very comfortable. Easy to drive. We love it. Also safe to drive with options lane change warning back up camera and much more beep if any vehicle passing by on side and on your back
"07 15, 2019",Just bought- Love so far!,"comfortable size, but not too big and boxy. handles well. gas-efficient for its size. looks cool. have heard only good reviews from long-time RAV4 owners so I'm hoping this will be a reliable vehicle for a long time."
"07 12, 2019",Comfortable car,Enjoy all the safety features and gas mileage is good. The car rides good and is comfortable for two people. The safety feature helped prevent an accident on a recent trip.
"07 11, 2019",This is my 3rd one!!,Extremely reliable and fun to drive.  It is the perfect size for anything and everything I need to do! My next car?  Probably another RAV4!
"06 29, 2019",My best car ever...,"No words, It feels very comfortable inside. 

I really like it! 

You better buy it and you'll surely enjoy driving it...

My Toyota is fantastic..."
"06 27, 2019",Most comfortable car we’ve owned,We are very pleased with the comfort of this car. There is plenty of legroom front & back. It rides well & handles well also.
"06 24, 2019",Love Toyotas,"Not as nice as 4 Runner that we owned for 11 years but we knew it is a lower grade vehicle. 
Great gas mileage. Comfortable. Smooth driving. Love the lane departure beeps and the cruise control automatic slow down when cars ahead of you slow down or stop suddenly. 
One thing I don’t like is the sometimes not smooth slow down on cruise control when going down a hill. It seems under 60 mph that the gears shift jerkily and brakes apply. Sort of makes sense, but never had a cruise control on any car act that way."
"06  5, 2019",cute car,I have always owned  small cars and never wanted to get into an SUV but this doesn't drive like an SUV. awesome car love it
"06  4, 2019","I get a lot of compliments from passengers, great",I drive Lyft and my passengers are always happy with the comfort and interior space in this vehicle.   It is very reliable and easy to handle in heavy rain or traffic conditions.
"05 24, 2019",Fantastic,"It is just perfect for I am loving it. I am very happy with my car I love the color, the interior . It's great on merge.l"
"05 22, 2019","My first ever TOYOTA, but definitely won't be last",The safety feature even on base model that smth fascinates me.  The best value for safety and performance. I love its cruise features with radar assisted driving.
"05 13, 2019",One of the most reliable cars I’ve owned,"This vehicle is comfortable, handles well and feels sturdy and strong. Excellent suspension; barely feel any bumps in the road.  Would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a reliable SUV."
"05  9, 2019",Drivers seat is not a power seat,Need power seat for and need more room inside  for this price. Need  one more coffee cup space in the front.   Need to have more cargo space.
"05  9, 2019",Great combination of sporty/family friendly.,"We got this car to help accommodate our growing family- 2 adults, 2 dogs, 1 kid, and planning for more. We were deciding between the RAV4 and the CRV and ultimately thought that the RAV4 met more of our needs for cargo, performance, and price."
"05  7, 2019",I lovvvvve my Rava4,"I have wanted to buy a Rava4 for years and in October 2018, I was able to purchase it from Hendrick Toyota in Apex, N.C.   My salesman, Alston worked with me and gave me a good deal on it.  I have not regretted buying it.  I enjoyed everything about it and if I was to purchase another one after some years have passed, it would be another Rava4."
"05  7, 2019",Great SUV!,"I purchased a used 2018 Toyota R4.  I love the color, style and all the features it included.  Even though it is a 4 cylinder, I feel I am able to merge with traffic on the highway without a worry.  And having AWD, I feel I'm ready for any winter weather!  It's comfortable and just the right size without being too big."
"04 30, 2019",very good car. in design and usability,this car services it purpose for my wife to drive to work . whether the weather is good or bad.  all wheel drive is good for slick roads.
"04 27, 2019",Love it!,I’ve only had the vehicle for a xxxx time but I love it so far. It’s a perfect size for someone wanting something bigger than a sedan but not something as large as a SUV
"04 18, 2019",My favorite car!,"I've had 5 Camrys; enjoyed them all, but they became a little difficult to get in and out. This Rav is perfect in every way!!!!"
"04 16, 2019",New car doesn’t mean reliable tires,"Purchased this car new, 5 months ago less than 3000 miles on it and had a blow out on the thruway going 65 miles per hour, cannot trust the tires on this car, blowout was crossing a treads and was four inches in length, obviously a manufacturers defect . neither tire manufacturer or dealership would do anything For this despite this being a new car choose your tires carefully and of course add to your purchase price by getting “tire coverage”  as neither Toyota, the dealership nor the tire manufacturer will stand behind the product they sell"
"04  9, 2019",Great to drive,I recently purchased a low mileage 2018. I like the vehicle's turning radius and it seems to have lower road noise than my honda Civic. The cargo area is very large.
"04  8, 2019",Reliability but Boring......,"I got this car because I need to go to work and take my family  out for a trip sometimes, Needless to say, Toyota  is the best choice I can make, After CRV 2018 have some Engine problems, but I still NOT happy to see the out of time interior design, and a little expense than other SUVs."
"04  3, 2019",Has all the bells and whistles,This car has all the safety bells and whistles that are available today. These are so important today especially for seniors. Highly recommend it to seniors.
"03 21, 2019",P&S GOSSELIN,"IT IS GOOD FOR GOING AROUND CITY AND GOOD ON HWY 
NOT USE TO SIZE BUT HOPE IT WILL GROW ON ME AS WE MIGHT TRAVEL THIS SUMMER TO BRAMPTON  ONTARIO"
"03 16, 2019",Just the car I wanted!,I have really enjoyed driving my new RAV. It is the first SUV I have ever had. I have always driven a mid size car. I enjoy being a little higher up.
"03 10, 2019","3rd Toyota i purchased, , very reliable car.","very comfortable, Reliable. I also purchased this Toyota vehicle because of the Safety rating. My sons will use this vehicle also to go back & forth to work & school."
"03  4, 2019",very reliavle car,very happy with the car  very comfortable back seat could have a little more coution in it but over all it is a very good car.
"03  4, 2019",This vehicle meets all my needs.,All the extras especially the heated seats make driving this a pleasure. It is very comfortable with plenty of leg room for all passengers and large area for transporting items.
"02 28, 2019",It's a Toyota RAV4!,"The RAV4 is of perfect size.  Not to big and not to small.  I purchased it because it is dependable, comfortable, and reliable.  This is my 4th."
"02 27, 2019",Toyota is the most reliable car i have ever owned,"I love it’s looks, how it handles, and it’s value. I feel rich! It has plenty of storage, even the back seats are comfortable ! It’s a Toyota. Nuff said."

WHITE RIVER TOYOTA - ASK FOR SARAH REYNOLDS"
"02 21, 2019","Very reliable, great quality. Second RAV4 we own.","Very comfortable and great in snow. I purchased a 2015 new and it is the best vehicle I’ve purchased.  When it came time for my wife to upgrade she wouldn’t purchase anything but the same thing, a 2018 limited. So now we own two RAV4 vehicles.  Toyota quality and reliability."
"02 20, 2019","Love this car,has more bang for the buck","This car exceeds my beautiful dash , probably could drive itself.Engine has alot morning pep than I thought.Love the backup features and cruise control is awesome.Has great leg and head room in backseat and they tilt back !!!Seat warmers are fantastic for cold ."
"02 18, 2019","Good, but disappointed in a couple of features","I have two complaints. First the smaller driver info center will not display speed. So you have to rely on the speedometer which is difficult to view. Secondly, the vehicle is equipped with remote start. However on entering the vehicle it shuts off. What ? I have a Chevy Cruz and F-150 with remote start that do NOT do this. Why ? Dumb !"
"02 17, 2019",This is the best vehicle I’ve own.,It’s not too big or too small. Everything about this RAV4 is a plus. The one best thing is cruise control.  I set it 73 mph and it will always adjust for me to stay safe distance between vehicle in front of me.
"02 17, 2019",I love this car!,I had owned a Nissan X-Terra for 11 years and no longer sold in the U.S.  I no longer needed the towing capacity but loved the no-nonsense performance.  The Rav4 was a great choice for me.  The driver and passenger seating is much roomier and very comfortable with all the high-tech necessities.
"02 13, 2019",My 8 month ownership review-2018 Rav4 XLE,"I am 59 years old and live in the northeast, and, have owned 25 or more cars in my life.

I am into my 8th month of a 36 month lease. My first Toyota ever. A 2018 Rav4 XLE with some extras I added on like: Remote start, door edge guards/ full luggage rack system/ upgraded mats and a power lift gate.

I purchased this vehicle after a lot of research. I wanted an economical SUV for commuting and golf trips. I wanted reliability and a full warranty. I wanted some degree of comfort. I wanted value and a low monthly payment. And, I need all wheel drive. My job is supervising storm event crews. Often I am on the roads to work before the DOT has mobilized. 

This car has met and exceeded all the above expectations. It drives just fine. Sits high enough above the road to be confident. Accelerates quickly for a 4 cylinder. Handles curves well. Has a tight turning radius. Excellent visibility. Excellent safety sense stuff. Very good headlight system and a really excellent cruise/radar system. The front crash brake deployed on me one day when I wasn't paying attention to the road. IT WORKS! Prevented an accident. Interior controls are laid out well. Leg room is very good, specially the rear seat leg room.

A few things I am not as enthusiastic about: Speakers sound tin-like. Less than adequate cubby hole space in the front. Rear cargo space is lacking ( I had a 2004 Pathfinder & an 09 Hyundai Santa Fe prior. They had better space) Seats can be a bit stiff, but, they are better than some I have test driven.  Sun roof is noisy when cracked open. You need rain guards for the main windows.

Add everything up and my minor complaints don't amount to a hill of beans compared to the main components. This car is built well, reliable and an excellent value. I will buy it after the lease because after 8 months I can see it will still be dependable, hold its value and not cost me an arm and a leg to repair. Like all cars: Just stay up to date on factory recommended maintenance."
"02 13, 2019","Love my car, no reliable service!","This crossover is perfect for senior citizens - very comfortable, easy to get into with my disability, the back storage is easier for me to use than a deep trunk, stylish, and handles well in the snow."
"02 13, 2019",Great car,"Met all of our needs, great car good on mileage, comfortable reliable, good all around, toyota to me are the best cars, I test drove it and it handled perfectly, took it on the highway and it drove really good, would not change it for any other brand, If I had to choose again it would be the same brand."
"02 13, 2019",The best car I’ve owned,This car is very comfortable for a trip and the gas is very cheap. This car have a very good machine and wonderful style and the best size!
"02 12, 2019","Year 1: So far, I'm very happy","Found my 2018 RAV4 (Adventure) to be a really good deal for the $$$. It came with a some great options for living in the Northeast that would have cost me another $5K if I purchased something comparable from FORD, SUBARU, Chevy, Honda and others. Imagine getting Safety features, Sun Roof, USB ports, Power Inverter, HEATED STEERING WHEEL, Black Painted Wheels, and more for under $35K. Did I mention 2 Years FREE Oil changes, fluid checks and tire rotations!!! My only 'CON' so far is the radio setup which I wish I had knew more about and could have upgraded. You cannot have 1 single screen for Radio/Phone/NAV the least you can show is two screens and the radio is less than 8 inches!!! I use my phone for most of my Nav needs which is sad. Changes in 2019 are a new body style which I think looks pretty cool, but let's see when I move on in two more years. The competition has taken notice and beginning to add the same things that Toyota already has as STANDARD.  Nobody is going to overpay for BSM, Traction control, Brake Assist and other soon so the others better figure it out and keep it under $35K"
"02 11, 2019",super car,"Getting used to the size, comfort very good and visibility suits us perfectly.  Only con is buzzer for open door and lane crossover is too quiet.  Otherwise, enjoying the ride!"
"02 11, 2019",Excellent value!,The RAV 4 is the perfect car for my family! Great gas mileage for my commute to work each day. Roomy interior...I can fit 3 car seats in the back for weekends with my grandchildren.
"02  8, 2019",Happy Customer,We are very pleased so far.  We have only driven 60 miles but this was a very windy day and this vehicle handled very well.
"02  4, 2019",My second Toyota and I Love it!,"Great space, without sacrificing comfort. Quiet interior. Plenty of power for in town and highway. My only complaint would be the outdated audio and phone integration. Cmon’ Toyota, get Car Play in all your vehicles."
"01 31, 2019",Reliable Mom Car,"Living in New England and having a baby, I needed something safe and reliable. This car is excellent. I feel confident driving in it. Great traction. The only negative feedback is that ice easily gets stuck under the windshield wipers so it doesnt clean that great."
"01 31, 2019",Best looking car I have owned.,This car is so comfortable.  I love sitting higher up than the sedan I previously owned.  The Rav4 is way too smart.  It helps me drive. I have two grandchildren and I feel safer with them in the car.
"01 30, 2019",Feel so much safer than in previous car I owned.,I need to travel rural highways and roads to which have been coveted with snow drifts this year.  I made it thru!!  Thank you Rav 4 Adventure!
"01 28, 2019",Great in the snow.,"I was looking for a small SUV, so I can be more comfortable driving in the snow. RAV4 was an excellent choice! I've looked at some other cars but felt like Toyota cars are more reliable."
"01 27, 2019",First Toyota I have ever owned  awesome!!!,"I had been looking for several months and I'm glad that I took my time. I have never owned a Toyota, I m a very happy owner."
"01 26, 2019",Excellent SUV,"It has been the most economic great performing SUV IVE EVER OWNED.  It’s “loaded” with lots of upgrades— and was the best value for the money compared to Honda, Lexus, and BMW."

"01 24, 2019",Best Car I Have Ever Owned!,"I bought my first RAV4 after I retired because I wanted to travel and do things with family and friends and it was perfect! So I recently replaced my 2014 RAV4 with a 2018 RAV4 and so far, I am even more pleased. The 2018 drives and feels like the 2014 but there are even more safety features! I am thrilled....fits the luggage, fits the friends, smooth & quiet ride, good on gas, reliable and extremely comfortable!"

I only wish the gas mileage was higher. My actual gas mileage averages about 14 miles per gallon. Granted I have a heavy foot (75-85 mph) but most of my driving is highway miles.

It has all of the interior features I was looking for, is classy looking,  handles nicely and was a fair price. Although the back seat has ample room,  I do wish the seats themselves were a bit more plush. They feel quite firm,  but it's still a comfortable ride due to the space.  The front seats are much more comfortable to sit in.  Both the interior and exterior are a very classy design. Love,  love this new Rav4!"

"01 13, 2019",Most fun car I have every owned.,"Love the design - inside and out.  Very peppy, and drives like a dream.  The controls are easy to reach.  The sound system is great.  Test drove a CRV but disappointing compared to a RAV4."
"01 13, 2019","Rubbish car, unreliable,  lousy service from Toyot","Uncomfortable seats, lousy suspension,  diesel is gutless (barely tows a laden box trailer ). Very dated design and poor value for the money. Starter motor destroyed itself (car 9 months old) and after  3 weeks still waiting on parts - been told could be a 6 week wait. Not good enough Toyota!"
"01 12, 2019",Most reliable car I have own.,"This car met my all needs. Sufficient room, beautiful car, very comfortable. It has all technical advanced specially I like the blind spot signal etc and very good strong tire and best judgment on road when drive. I recommend this car to all the people."

I couldn’t imagine a better car for me!
"01  5, 2019",This car fits me so comfortably.,I love it!  This is my fourth and would not have any other car. I was rear-ended in a horrible accident and the officers said the car saved my life.

"01  5, 2019",Mediocre and noisy,I test drove this.  Positives include good rear cargo space and decent seats.  Negatives-I couldn’t get past how noisy it was.  The transmission revs up and sounds like a bunch of bees.  The entertainment center is dated. I see no reason to get this unless reliability is your only consideration.

I bought this vehicle primarily on the reputation of the past three vehicles I've had that were of Toyota descent. This vehicle has plenty of room and accommodation that meet a large or small person.

Things I don’t like - gear selection gate is juvenile - changed less than average cloth interior to leather (Roadwire) for $1000 - changed steel wheels/hubcaps to aluminum for $500"

I like the looks of it and how I am able to go out in any condition here in Maine like a tank! I'm tall so I needed a lot of leg and head room and this suv is spacious!

From the moment we sat in our RAV4 it was clear that it eclipsed the competition.  The drive is sure and secure...and quiet.  Amazing!"
"11 18, 2018",like the saftey features,We were in a wreck in which our 2018 Toyota Rav4 was totaled.  No one in our car was even scratched.  I know that the person in the Smart car would have been seriously hurt if it had not been for the collision avoidance on our car.  We replaced the car with a new 2018 identical to the wrecked one.  We would not have any other after seeing the safety features in action.  Value?  One night in a hospital could cost more than the new car.

Well I went into Labadie in Bay City, Michigan to begin shopping for a new car as my 16 year old  second car in New York was not going to pass inspection in December as it was rusting out underneath.  The plan was to take the Michigan Corolla to NY and get a new vehicle for Michigan.  My salesperson at Labadie listened to my needs and recommended I try a test drive in a Rav 4.  It was totally awesome how well it handled and how well I fit behind the wheel.  I ended up making the purchase and find that it is not too big for me and that I can manage it just find.  In fact I love this vehicle more than any car I have ever had.  It is sheer pleasure to drive and I look forward to a long term relationship with this SUV.  Given my age, it could in fact be my last vehicle.  All of the smart car features on it are reassuring and practical.  My Labadie salesman was Al Gradowski.  I highly recommend the Rav 4 and Al as your facilator in making your purchase."

"11 14, 2018","Sleek, comfortable and efficient","My 2018 RAV4 Limited has all the comforts my Audi had, leather and heated seats, Navigation and backup view, and tons of fun safety features I didn?t think possible for the price.  And 9 airbags!"
"11 13, 2018",Dependable car,I am a particularly nervous driver and with the safety features the rav 4 offers I have never felt safer.

Interior lighting is poor,  especially at night.  Controls on doors are not visible.   No interior trunk release and rear hatch opening is cumbersome."
"11  3, 2018",Safe drive,"This vehicle has many safety features, such as blind spot monitoring and lane departure alarms. The interior and exterior have a sleek look which makes the SUV look nice."

"10 31, 2018",Nice car,"I like the way it looks and drives. It?s a Toyota, what more can I say. I do wish that it came with a remote starter, like most vehicles in its class. It was disappointing that they were charging more just to have it installed."

"10 22, 2018","most effecient, and quitest car I've ever owned","After test driving several hybrids, I knew as soon as I drove off the lot that the Toyota Rav4 was the one.

"10 21, 2018",Best small suv,Highway mileage is impressive. Very comfortable even in the back. Reclining seats and lots of leg room in the back adds to the overall comfort.

"10 15, 2018",Love this car and all the safety features,"I had a 2010 Rav4 that ended up in an accident so I knew already that I was comfortable with having a Rav4.  I did some research comparing it to other like SUVs but when we went to the dealership and get a terrific deal on a gently used 2018 model, that was it!  The upgrades from my previous Rav4 are terrific, especially the safety features. Love the space, the styling and the features so accessible on the steering column. The ride is smooth and quiet. I have been driving this car for almost a week and still find it fun to drive.  Although it was used, it was gently used (4,500 miles) as one of the dealer cars.  Got the Carfax so I know it was well taken care of."

"10 10, 2018","I like it, but wish I'd checked it out more first!","I do really love this car, BUT we purchased this assuming it could fit FIVE people in it. It's really more of a 4 seater. The center seat in the back is difficult to use, since the seatbelts are literally UNDER the butt. Only a very small person can sit there, and you can't buckle in a booster/carseat in that center spot. It's annoying, having 3 kids and now they're uncomfortable any time we're all together. 

Other than that, it's pretty great. 

I originally bought the LE (it was an error by the salesman. We sat in the XLE) and also test drove an LE, but they worked up our paperwork, etc so I decided to tolerate it. 29 days later, I went back and traded it for the XLE. If you ever have the option of an LE-go straight up to the XLE!! Too many basic amenities missing in the LE trim."
"10 10, 2018","Amazing features for the price, drives amazing.","This is a perfect compact SUV. You get the gas mileage and affordable fill ups of a car, with the benefits and space of an SUV. plenty of USB slots to charge devices, ease of linking my phone was great. Love that it ""learned"" my voice, and when my phone is linked will even read text messages out loud to me and I can respond. Love that it has a weather app so I can keep an eye on it if it's bad. The safety features like line departure and it automatically slowing you down if you're using cruise control and someone gets in front of you going really slow really give peace of mind driving with a young child. The car itself is incredibly comfortable, the heated seats do lumbar as well and makes travel with a bad back so much easier! They heat up great and fast, it was like driving with a built in heating pad. The center console is spacious, and my son's large convertible car seat easily fit (and was easy to install with the LATCH system). Perfect for a parent, perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time on the road. I can't say enough good things about it and have never been happier with a vehicle choice."
"10 10, 2018",Stylish yet sporty looking,I did a lot of research on this vehicle and was not disappointed in my Toyota RAV 4 XLE. It has several safety features and creature comforts. I was pleased to purchase this for my college aged daughter and know it will not only last her a long time but will provide her with a safety oriented vehicle.
"10 10, 2018",Already saved my butt in traffic,"Safety is key, it's already stopped me from getting into two accidents! I love this car so much. It's sleek, great on gas and my family loves it"

"10  5, 2018",Lifetime RAV4 owner,"I have no reason to own a different car - this is my second one. 
The performance & sturdiness of this car is exceptional for the price
I?ll always buy  a RAV4.  No doubts!!!!
Driving the car sells itself."

"10  4, 2018",A Great Experience,"I am a little on heavy side, but this car fits like a glove. It feels like a race car, rather then an all wheel drive car. This car takes off like race car when you need to pull out into the traffic. It?s better then the RAV4 that I traded in for it. I was not aware of all the new safety features that they had built into this car. Best of all, I finally got my RED Car."
"10  3, 2018",Test drive,I am wanting to replace my Acura MDX and thought a smaller SUV might work.  I have owned Toyotas in the past so thought I would see what the Rav4 was like.  I was not thrilled about the interior space but I'm used to a larger cabin.  The Honda CRV is roomier in comparison.
"10  2, 2018",My 3rd new Toyota,"Great quiet ride.   This is my 2nd Rav4.  Driver seating is high and easy for me to see the road.  Feeling secure for winter driving with the 4 wheel drive.   Plenty of cargo space and lots of safety features, which sold me on this purchase."
"09 28, 2018",Great Vehicle,"Amazing vehicle with a lot of technology. Very stylish and comfortable with plenty of room for me, family and luggage. Have several friends who also own one. After much research I decided on this vehicle over others in class. I have owned several Toyota?s over the years and understand why this is currently best selling SUV in New England, in its class. Very pleased with my decision!"
"09 26, 2018",I have only owned it for three weeks the jury out,I love the way it handles the only thing so far is this seat make my back hurt after several miles  it would be nice if it had lumbar support
"09 26, 2018",Excellent vehicle,"Ride is smooth and quiet. This vehicle provides all the comfort & needs we need in our vehicle! The seats recline, even in the rear. Roomy, sporty, and stylish."
"09 25, 2018",The best car I've owned,This car has exceeded expectations. I love the USB port in the front. The leg room in the back is great. I love all the safety bells and whistles that helps me drive safely. The automatic speed adjuster for speed control is fantastic.
"09 24, 2018",Just purchased. Seems to be good size and comfort,"Rides good. Little noisy . Seats are comfortable, nice the back recline. Nice styling for a SUV. Only had it 1 day so far. So we will see where it goes from here."

"09 20, 2018",Great Price on a great car.,"Got a 2018 RAV4 Limited at substantial year end savings. Car has all the latest safety features and it's roomy and drives great. The car comes loaded and it's a much better value than Honda CR-V, which I traded in."
"09 19, 2018",Toyota gets it right,"This car is meeting my expectations. Toyota's seat configuration and adjustment controls makes it possible for me to drive long distances without aggravating my back pain. The ride is smooth, handling is easy, and the vehicle responsive. I enjoy driving it and like the interior design."
"09 16, 2018",So far very dependable,"I would prefer to think I had real leather seats and not (soft tex). I wish I had the back up  and front  beepers, which I miss.  I am going to have the remote start installed which I also miss."
"09 15, 2018",RAV4 excellent car,"This car gives me the peace of mind I need for our family. It runs very well, it has many safety features, and its also stylish! What else you can ask for? Also is priced well when you find the right dealership."

"08 28, 2018",Just bought another Rav4,"I love Rav4s. I have an 2015 one and just bought an 2018, XLE model. Both are great but the updates that they did to the 2018 aren?t so great. The backup camera is blurry. I have taken it to 3 Toyota dealers and they told me it?s the same for all cars. They should put a better quality camera. The settings for phones has changed and it?s harder to make calls. Voice command doesn?t under anything. The time used to be on the dash and now it?s on the screen. They should of left the interior like they had on the 2015. Also I was looking for the beige interior and was told the dealers don?t order them because no one wants to buy the light colored ones. I do!  If your reading this Toyota. Make these updates better."
"08 28, 2018",Very happy,"Wasn?t sure if I would like RAV4, so I leased it.  So glad I did.  This car does not disappoint & I definitely buy one."
"08 28, 2018",Just right for me,"This car is exactly what I was looking for. It is reliable, safe, stylish, and fun to drive. It gets great gas mileage. I love the safety features."
"08 27, 2018",I nice suv,Third Toyota we owned  build the great . Nice ride low maintenance highly recommend can?t say anything bad will get another one after . Well  made.  Nice handling

With its new equipment that keeps you safe distance from the car in front of you she loved it driving 1400 miles back home, cruise control works with it making driving easy and safe. The new rebate was a plus $3000 off plus dealers gave $1000 off  anything on there lot. Plus a great trade in. My daughter drove her trade in 1400 miles to take advantage of this deal. We live in Pa. BTW. They also service her new car out there free oil changes free inspections with the extra warranty they offered beat any deal that was out there.

The transmission makes a whistling sound whe decelerating, the navigation system will get you lost about 50% of the time and the mileage is terrible for a small SUV. I have owned ten new Toyota?s and this is my last. The company does not care about quality like it used to. Now it?s all numbers."
"08 15, 2018",Great reliable fuel efficient AWD,"The wife wanted the Rav4 and after some debate, I finally gave in. Best little AWD crossover I have had the pleasure of dealing with. Our Rav4 hasn't missed a beat, and yet we have beat up on it pretty good. I am a service employee at a Ford dealer, and we are always having Ford Escapes and Edges coming in for repairs or recalls. Our Toyota Rav4 has been free of all those headaches. I'd like to see a bit more horsepower, but fuel mileage is good. Currently getting 23mpg when doing only city driving, and 32mpg only highway.  Interior may seem a little cramped, but it is roomier than the Ford Escape, so I like it."
"08 15, 2018",Best car I ever owned.,"Fun to drive solid feel.  Smooth ride, Good Mileage. Good head room , Handles nice. Great traction. Good view. Great cargo room. Easy to get in and out of."
"08 15, 2018",Most safety car!,"I was an car Acsident and my RAV4 safe my and my husband Life. Very young driver in big old truck  did not stop on RED light and kill my 3 days old  brand new RAV4 limited 2018 car, but me and my husband could get out of the car alive.  RAV4 is the best car I ever had."
"08 14, 2018",Greatest value,So far so good. Lots of room for groceries and other items. It?s pretty fast for a small suv. The finish looks awesome. Real comfortable ride.
"08 13, 2018",Most comfortable and reliable car I have ever owne,This car meets all of my many expectations I had. Very roomy and comfortable and love the way it drives. All of the many safety features it has is awesome.

AWD...LET IT SNOW!!! 
SOUND SYSTEM IS AWESOME ."
"08  9, 2018",Rav 4 good for your pocket,"This car is a medium size, dependable, comfortable and very affordable. The interior is roomie and comfortable. It comes with a lot of great safety features."
"08  9, 2018",not as great as I would hope,I have always had a Toyota.  I use to drive a highlander previously.  Is this Rav 4 the same? NO.  I was use to a smooth ride.  This seems to buckle or it seems as if I am driving a standard.  Not smooth at all .  It's very nice inside . I expect it to last long time.  Has some fun features.
"08  9, 2018",Absolutely the best car I have ever had possessio,"I am in love with my rav xle ....my OCD will be at a 10 as I don?t want anyone or anything near my rav .....
I love the way it drives and the size is absolutely perfect"

"08  6, 2018",Great Car for Road Trips With Family,The car gives a great amount of room for comfort while also providing a great amount of safety signals. The stock stereo system is FANTASTIC. I love this car!!! Thank you Jaffarian Toyota!!
"08  5, 2018","The good, the bad and the ugly","The good on the 2018 Rav4 XL/AWD is the ride... smooth, the steering is responsive, and Toyota's reputation. The bad is body paint is very thin,,hair line scratches show up strong on the dark color. A lot of outside plastic... the ugly is the inside Very cheap plastic, the seat material is terrible and not very comfortable... MPG is alright, not what a light weight small SUV should be getting.  I Have driving this car for 6 months and have 2300 miles. Hope it lasts like my other cars have.."
"08  5, 2018",Toyota won?t fix XM Radio,"This is our third Toyota. The second RAV4. It?s a great vehicle, but our XM Radio always goes off air when we go in the direction of south. We get a message saying No Signal. Taken to dealer twice and they do nothing. Reported to Toyota and they have done nothing. This might be the LAST Toyota we will buy."
"08  3, 2018",I feel much safer in the Rav4 than my last car.,"After test driving multiple SUVs, the RAV4 was the most comfortable to drive. The ride is smooth, and I feel safe. It was the best economical choice for me, and having family and friends who own and trust Toyota vehicles gives me peace of mind in my choice. I also like the fact that it is AWD living in an area where we get a lot of snow at times."
"08  3, 2018","Love it ,has everything I need","I love the color , the safety features, very sporty .I can say this car is one of the best one I owned It has plenty of room pleasure to drive,"
"08  1, 2018",Awesome!,"I love this SUV. It's not too big and not too small, just the right size with plenty of leg room in both, the front and back seats. All the technology I need and excellent safety features."
"08  1, 2018",My last car had to be perfect and it is!,Love it! The best car  ?.. I could have bought anything and I chose a Rav 4. My first car was a 1976 Corolla that I bought new. And now that I?m 69 my last car is a Rav 4.
"08  1, 2018",Retired and Loving Our Rav4,"We had a Toyota Highlander, which we loved, but it was a bit large for only the two of us.  We gave the Highlander to my daughter and leased a Rav4.  I love driving the Rav4 because it's easy to maneuver and has so many great safety features.  We took an 11 hour trip with five (3 grandkids) of us and it was very roomy.  The Rav4 drives very smoothly on the highway and back roads. I'm so glad we decided to lease this car."
"08  1, 2018",My third Rav4,"Very reliable, affordable and comfortable.  I really like the new 2018 XLE, it is slightly bigger than the LE, and the comfort of the seats are a step up."
"07 31, 2018",Eh it's ok,I really don't like this vehicle it's a complete gas hog. I have had 3 things go wrong with it already and I have had it for 7 months. I wish I could get out of my lease!!
"07 31, 2018",Great for Traveling!,"This car has amazing features that are perfect for someone who travels a lot. It?s safe, reliable, and a great price. I would highly recommend this vehicle."
"07 30, 2018",I love my RAV4!,"The SUV meet all my needs.  It is roomy, responsive, reliable, safe and I sit up nice and high.  It is also visually pleasing.  I lke the way it drives."
"07 30, 2018",I love the roominess of the RAV4,"I only tested the RAV4 as it was the only one I was interested in, my previous car was a Camry. This is our 5th purchase from Toyota Central Florida."
"07 30, 2018",Road Trip Vehicle,"I expect the RAV4 to have the same longevity and reliability as almost all other Toyota vehicles. However, it does not have air vents in the back seat (making it not very suitable for keeping the back seat cool for infants and toddlers)."
"07 30, 2018",Exactly what I was looking for,"After months of research, everything pointed towards the Toyota RAV4 XLE. I leased a 2018 model last month. Here is my checklist: Fuel Economy: 26 mpg-yes. Under $30,000-yes. Modern safety features-yes. Room for golf clubs.-yes. Commuter friendly-yes. Some free maintenance (2yrs)-yes. Comfort-yes. Manufacturer reputation for reliability-yes.

I have a 3 year lease. I bought an extra 3000 miles a year up front (45,000 total) because of my commute. I was able to negotiate some freebies like weather proof mats, edging, mud guards. I plan to retire in three years, so, I wanted fixed costs. This Toyota lease fit the bill. Good fuel economy (I was getting 19 with my 09 Santa Fe. 26 with the RAV) low monthly payments and hopefully little to no cost maintenance and repairs. After I retire I either buy it or get something else. either way my automobile costs are fixed for the next 3 years.

Its an excellent car. Not plush, but, everything you would need for up to 4 passengers."
"07 28, 2018",One Of The Best Vehicles I have Owned,Meets All Of My Current Needs has all the latest  bells and whistles Performs extremely well on all road conditions. Is extremely comfortable to drive

"07 23, 2018",Upgraded from a 2015 to a 2018 ~~~ Love them both.,"This was an upgrade from my 2015 Rav4 XLE to a 2018 Rav4 Adventure Edition. Love, love, love it. Love all the safety features that my 2015 didn't have.  This is our 6th new Toyota since 2006."
"07 23, 2018",Great riding SUV,"I've only had it 4 days. So far I love it 
it drives great .I feel safe driving on the freeway like that you can put your finger to start the car to lock it the key stays in your pocket"
"07 23, 2018",Loving it,I love the safety features and simplistic interior design. All wheel drive will keep me safer in the snow. Nice ride compared to my other similar styled vehicle.
"07 23, 2018",LEAST reliable car I've ever owned!,"My 2003 Camry ran better (30+ gas mileage, no surging, rode & drove smooth) than 2018 Rav4. Gas mileage sucks, rides like a log wagon, growls like somethings wrong with transmission & brakes did squeal but now they're OK. Wish I'd never  drove into Roberts Toyota that Saturday!"
"07 22, 2018",Really enjoy driving this car good,This car is perfect for my needs looks good drives good mileage OK interior OK I have the LE model no frills but great would recommend this car to naybody

"07 19, 2018",Great Value for a great car,"Car met all my expectations and the safety is top notch. I would definetly recommend this to a friend. Also the package of free service up to 25,000 miles adds even more value to this car"
"07 19, 2018",New 2018 version is owesome.,"I bought this car for my spouse and now waiting weekends to drive this car. All wheel drive, fast, soft, perfect for going to outdoor adventures."

"07 18, 2018",Love our RAV4,My wife loves her new car.  She looks forward to having AWD this winter.  The road noise is minimal.  The car feels solid and tight.  It's so nice to have the latest in safety features.
"07 17, 2018",Just got the Rav4 because my Venza's lease was up.,"I've only had this car for 4 days, so I'm still getting used to it.  I had the Venza before the Rav4, and sadly, really miss my Venza.  The Rav is fine, but missing a few things I had with the Venza - a little loose change compartment, and a built in garage door opener.  It rides very well."
"07 16, 2018",Our first SUV that we have owned.,It is our first and it has many new features on it that we have never had in the pass. We like the way it handle and the MPG we are getting on this vehicle. I like the fact it is easy to get into being I have certain health issues.
"07 16, 2018",Smoothest driving vehicle I have owned,Love my new Rav 4  Trail Edition.  The spacious trunk room is perfect for my new big stroller. I love all the different add ons the Trail Edition has.
"07 16, 2018",Best car I?ve owned,"I?ve always wanted this car. It has great safety features for our growing family. Toyota is realible car, and know it?ll last us a long time."
"07 16, 2018",Most Reliable car I've ever owned,"I was in the market for an SUV but didn't want anything to big. The Toyota RAV4 has met all of my needs. Nothing too flashy. I don't need all the distracting bells and whistles- just a comfortable, reliable car to get from point A to point B. After purchasing this car, I realized that even my base model has so much more to offer than just the ""standard""SUV"". Lots of leg room, huge trunk, great stereo system. Overall, I love my new SUV!"
"07 15, 2018","Time to try a better brand, bye Toyota!","This is the last time my family and I plan to have a Toyota car. It's time to explore better brands.
We feel that instead of upgrading our RAV4, we went back to an older model. Compare the features of models 2016 and 2018 to see what I mean. Two examples: 
1. The GPS in the 2016 model is way better, the one in the 2018 one is useless and you need an app that doesn't work well so even the sales representative said that he prefers to use Google maps on his mobile.
2. The lift gate on the RAV4 2016 opens automatically but manually in the 2018 model."
"07 14, 2018",Car is quite attractive to us,"We like it. What more can we say, given that we have only had it for 3 days. So far it seems to meet our needs quite well."
"07 14, 2018",Love love love my rav 4! Feels grounded and safe.,"Roomy, smooth, grounded, great back up camera, voice recognition and sync for hands free, safety sensers. Could not be happier!
Can't wait for my first road trip!"
"07 13, 2018",Best car I've ever owned.,This car is everything that consumer reports said it was. Most reliable in its class with a proven track record. Toyota is the only car I will ever own. I now have 2 of them.
"07 12, 2018",Great driving Vehicle,"Very comfortable driving, Great road vision, great on gas, and very dependable. Good dealership and deal and satisfaction. I would recommend to all my friends with the dealer."
"07 11, 2018",liking the new car and great warranty,I like the comfort and it is roomy enough for a trip and save on gas too..Wish they would put Satellite radios in more models.That is the only thing I miss from my Ford Edge
"07 10, 2018",Back on the road again with a Toyota,Glad to be back in a Toyota again.  Very reliable and dependable SUV. Smooth ride. Great get up and go. Reasonably priced and affordable payments.
"07 10, 2018",Love my Rave 4,I have spent time researching  a good SUV  and so glad I bought this 2018 Rave 4. It is a beauty inside and out and runs so quietly  and smooth.
"07 10, 2018",Best suv ever,"So far so good i only had it for a week, we shall see how well it goes in the future, so far so good, i love all the new technology, all sensors for everything,  very comfortable, i love the ride so smooth"
"07 10, 2018",Great car for a baby boomer,"I have severe neck and back issues and was looking for a comfortable vehicle.  This RAV4 satisfies my needs.  The big side mirrors with vehicle detection helps a lot so I don't have to turn my neck to check the blind spot. The lumbar adjustment fits comfortably in my lower back. I love the backup camera feature.   The panel accessories are all placed in a comfortable reaching distance or functional from the steering wheel.  The automatic hatchback lift is a lifesaver for me with the neck/bursitis issues I have.  The ride is smooth with a lot of get-up-and-go for passing.  Plenty of room for groceries, folding chairs, etc. when we are out and about.   A GREAT VEHICLE!"
"07 10, 2018",OK for a 4 cyclinder,"It's good on gas, a cute vehicle.  The back seat is very difficult to adjust, and the leather seats are not as cushiony as I would like.  But the price was very reasonable."
"07  9, 2018",Very Impressed So Far,"Before buying our new car, we  researched and considered several makes and models but settled on the Toyota Rav 4 because of Toyota's overall reliability history.  We've owned a Toyota in the past and were very happy.  Features such as safety, capacity, quiet ride, and design all factored into our decision making."
"07  9, 2018",Our 3rd Rav 4,"We had a 2012 Rav4 Sport, which we loved. Our daughter now owns it and loves it.
We bought a 2018 EXL. The ride is smooth. Love the way the back lifts rather than opening left or right. Interior is an attractive fabric. Lots of features that we are going to read about and make use of.
love it !"
"07  9, 2018",Very happy with my new 2018 RAV4 Limited,"Very happy with my new 2018 RAV4 Limited
 This car has all the safety features that I was looking for.   Team Toyota in Schererville Indiana took very good care of me, Sa�d answered all my questions and was helpful  with all the features on the car"
"07  8, 2018",Toyota RAV4 Best car I've owned!,"I've had the Toyota RAV4 for a little over a month now.  I absolutely love this car. It drives so smoothly, and is great on gas mileage. The size and internal space of the car perfectly accommodates all of my needs; I'm able to comfortably fit other passengers, groceries, my school bag, and gym bag. The bluetooth and safety features are a huge plus. This is the perfect car for a mom or young student!"
"07  8, 2018",I love this car !,I am a young mom with 2 small kids and I absolutely love the space and comfort AND safety of this car. The gas is great and I love the feel when driving it .
"07  8, 2018",New Toyota,"We purchased the Riv4  mostly for my wife , who is short and needed better  visibility, and this suv gives it to her.  Myself, I would have went a different  unit.  Im more for sporty autos."
"07  7, 2018",My1sttoyota,"Great so far no issues,great gas mileage.lane assist awesome.auto lights helps and the undercarriage light at night great as I live in country,helps to see if anything under car."
"07  5, 2018",Love my Rav 4 Limited,"I have owned Toyota?s for many years now.  Just bought my Rav 4 Limited in May and absolutely love it.  The style looks sporty, gets great gas mileage and very dependable."
"07  4, 2018",andrew,This is a great vehicle jt has a nice ride. It is great on gas and is  very comfitable also great handling  and very stylish on the outside.
"07  4, 2018",Toyota Rav4 works beautifully!,"The only problem so far has been opening the trunk.  For some reason it doesn't want to open at first.  Newness maybe?  Also, sometimes the SUV doesn't want to turn off.  Other than those two things, after driving it for 2 weeks, it runs well."
"07  3, 2018",Love this car!,"I recently bought the 2018 RAV4 XLE and this is a very reliable car. I also had a 2013 in the same model, but had over 110,000 miles on it and it also got a small oil leak which I found was expensive to repair, because the entire engine needed to be taken out to put a seal on. So I
 decided to get an new one. The mileage is good, I get about 27.5 miles per gallon and the new models have all the safety features, like Blind Spot Assist and automatic braking, along with warnings if you are drifting out of your lane. My old car got me through many snowstorms and it is a really good car for the money.  I would definitely recommend this car."
"07  3, 2018",Second Rav4 is awesome,"This is our second Rav4 and we love the new features that are now standard, such as the warnings for traveling out of your lane and the safety features on the cruise control.  It's a great looking, great driving car and Toyota of Riverside has"
"07  3, 2018",RAV4 Boom!!!,"Love my RAV4 Limited. Pretty good gas mileage. Love all the bells and whistles. Drives n rides like a dream. What would I change... the passenger seat!!! Sits too high, too much lumbar support and is not adjustable. Worst passenger seat ever! Also, a redesign on ""stuff"" holders and places. One little triangle hole and one open ended small flat space is awkward and useless."
"07  2, 2018",The perfect vehicle.,"This vehicle can really spoil a person.  Every amenity you want at a literally at the touch of a finger: locking/unlocking the doors, starting and shutting off the engine, using the radio and apps."
"07  2, 2018",Great car,This Car meets all my needs. It has all the safety  features I was looking for and is a comfortable ride.  Toyota always makes a good product.
"06 30, 2018",Just got it and love it already!,I owned a 2008 RAV4 before and really like it.  This new one has so many safety features that my traded-in 2015 Outback never had (not even self locking doors) that I feel so much safer already driving this vehicle.  I?m still working on understanding all of the new features I?ve never had before!
"06 30, 2018","My fourth Toyota, love them. Reliable.",I need something a little bigger and the Rav 4 is perfect.  Handles very well.  I like sitting up higher.  Has all the features I wanted.
"06 29, 2018","love it, have owned a toyota for past 20 years !!!","just the car that I wanted and needed,  love it, great style, comfort and great value, performs very well.   Has great style appeal, handles  well, great eye appeal."
"06 28, 2018",Entune Premium System Sucks,"The Entune Radio System is worthless and Toyota knows it.  If you paid out for the Premium System you just got taken. If you do not have a high definition signal in your area, your weather app and traffic app will not work - period. So why is Toyota using the Entune as a selling point?  Maybe it will work if you get onto an interstate. All Toyota will say is ""You have to have an HD signal."" So why is Toyota purposely selling something that works conditionally? Why not use the Sirius XM weather and traffic app? Also, your Sirius radio will constantly cut out. So you forked out $2200 for an option that does not work much of the time. Scan the internet to verify. Many Toyota owners are complaining about it, but the problem is not Sirius. It is the xxxx poor Entune system of Toyota who does not want to do anything about it. BY the way , I have only owned my RAV4 for about two months. My 2017 Tacoma does the same thing."
"06 28, 2018",Love my Rav!,"Dependable, beautifully styled, drives great! I would recommend this car to all of my friends and family! Always buy Ravs and wouldn?t want any other type of car. Perfect for me!"
"06 27, 2018",Great car,"This car has been great for us. We especially like the hatchback, as I have a walker that must travel with us. We also feel that this car has a lot of ?pep.?"
"06 24, 2018",Good Value,"Plenty of room even for a compact suv. Pleasant car to drive, even though I thought the CRV drove better. I bought the RAV4 over it, because of the gasoline in oil problem CRV  has with their 1.4 direct injection turbo engine. Reliability has always been my number one priority when buying a car. Toyota drive train is well proven."
"06 23, 2018",Really excited to experience my New Rav!!,It sits up high so that I can see around cars st stop lights. Love all of the safety features. This car hits all of my needs and desires!!!
"06 22, 2018",Power and torque awful. Needs 2.0t,It came down between the RAV4 the Mazda and the Hyundai and the Hyundai was the only one that had a 2.0 T and enough power to be fun to drive and also safe to drive when you really need to pull out quickly in a very congested City the RAV4 was just a dud it was such a shame. So well-built and woefully under-powered salesperson tried to say it was powerful with a straight face he couldn't do it. 15 minute test drive and we had found our 2.0t Hyundai Tucson better warranty better value same safety features and comfort features along with tech features it's just a better value.
"06 22, 2018",Pleased with my new purchase!,"This car may not have been rated the highest among compact SUVs, and there's stiff competition. But the base model meets all my needs and more! I never knew how much I needed BlueTooth connectivity, Lane Assist, and an Eco Mode in my car until now. It runs smoothly, has an excellent turning radius, and good line sights aided by blind spot mirrors. There's plenty of room in the front and back. All for a very reasonable price compared to very similar cars and with the reliability of the Toyota name!"
"06 21, 2018",Great Value for the Price on a CPO vehicle,"Met all our needs over the purchase of a new vehicle. Comfort and reliable. Clean interior, easy to Navigate and loaded with enough options, simple to use."
"06 21, 2018",toyota,this is first car i looked and liked it so bought it  toyota has great reliabilty and this fourth one i have owned so why change
"06 20, 2018",I feel very save in the RAV4,This car is so comfortable.  I love all the features.  Everybody wants to take my car when we go places............they all love it.  It is very easy to drive
"06 19, 2018",Downsized and I love this car!!,"We decided it was time to downsize from our 4Runner and started looking at the Rav4.  We were concerned it might not have enough room, but once we test drove it and saw the spacious interior, all concerns dissolved.  It not only has plenty of cargo room, but has great gas mileage too!   Plenty of room for four adults, no problem.  Five adults is fine for short distances, but a little snug for a road trip.
Love the safety features that come standard on the Rav4.  Nice job, Toyota!"
"06 19, 2018",It's My 4th Rav4,"I love my Rav4!  It is extremely reliable, it looks fashionable, it runs smoothly and provides a comfortable ride, and it's great for hauling big items.  It gets good gas mileage and I love the SmartKey ignition where I don't have to dig around and find my keys in my purse to open my car and start it.  There really isn't anything that I can say negative about my car, which is why this is the 4th Rav4 that I've leased."
"06 19, 2018",perfect size SUV,"This is a great car, smooth ride, nice features.... the only issue I have is  that I have a toddler and the center rear seat does not accommodate well to his booster seat so I have to place him on either side.  A little more room for a car seat in the center would make this the absolute perfect car."
"06 19, 2018",Very impressed with the vehicle.,"A lot of safety features, room, comfort, and style even in the base model. Very impressed with the handling and breaking. The cruise control is amazing."
"06 15, 2018",My second Rav4!,"This is my second Rav4. I previously owned a 2013, which was the first year of the current generation. The 2018 XLE I currently have seems to be more refined and is the last year of this generation. Slightly better ride quality, more advanced tech (which is included as standard) and proven reliability has been the reason why I stayed with the Rav. I am very impressed with the automatic high beams, lane departure assist, adaptive cruise control and other safety features such as BSM and CTA. Also, some added soft touch surfaces are very much noticed and greatly appreciated! Toyota makes a good car at a great value. The Rav provides a spacious interior (I am a 6ft tall man weighing in just under 300lbs), comfortable seating, and a layout that is very intuitive and just easy to use. My only (somewhat) complaints about this vehicle are: that it is a bit shy on power, and could use further enhancement of ride quality. Of course, even better fuel economy would be great too! As I never had any real repair issues with my previous RAV, the provided Toyota care visits for PM and further PM visits at my local deal, Jack Sherman Toyota, were always very efficient and a pleasant experience. I will continue to be a Toyota customer as long as the offerings are as good or better than what is currently out there!"
"06 15, 2018",RAV4 for Life,"We were rear-ended in our 2003 RAV4 and the insurance company totaled it. This made me very sad. I was not ready to give up my car. My RAV4 had so much life left! We needed a new vehicle and decided on another Toyota. We finally decided on another RAV4. It's completely different from my 2003 model, but I am getting used to it. It such a great ride, the safety ratings are pronominal, and there's much more room and bells a whistles too! Not to mention it fits our needs perfectly. I am looking forward to the next 15 years with my new RAV4!"
"06 15, 2018",Never had an issue with any of my Toyotas,"Nice, but dont fall for the warranty scam, these cars do not need a warranty for a number of years! Ive owned them most of my life and im past 60 years. Never used the basic warranty, let alone paying top dollar for ANY extended warranties when first purchased! waste of much needed money!I fell for the warranty scam once, but never again!"
"06 15, 2018",n/aaaaa,I really like the vehicle however the interior design could be better. Looking at other Rav4 vehicles the  interiors could be much better the 2 tone gray with black is very ugly.  It would be better with just one color on the seats
"06 14, 2018","2018 Rav 4, Absolutely love it!",I love the way my Rav 4 drives.  I love that my teenagers have plenty of  leg room in the back seat. My son is almost 6 foot. My favorite thing is the red stitching  on the interior.

"06 12, 2018",Love my new car,"Love my new 2018 RAV4!  It is very spacious and drives smoothly.   

If you are in the Baton Rouge area, head over to Price LEBLANC Toyota. Our sales consultant Brett Robertson was very knowledgeable, patient and helpful. He took the time to show us all the details of the vehicle we were interested in.  When I noticed that the one that I had chosen had a scratch on the side, he had another one brought over from Houston. It arrived less than 24 hours later!  He is very conscientious about his job, and we had a very good experience with him. He ordered some moulding that I wanted to add to the car and it looks great!"

The super-roomy back seat is perfect for groceries, baby seats, and whatever else you might need to toss back there.  Seriously, it's like a lounge area.  It's one of the last models that still comes with a full-size spare, which is handy.  Tons of trunk space with an auto open/close mechanism.  Lane assist and several other safety features warn you about blind spots, people in front and behind you, ect...  You pretty much CAN'T hit anything in this car.

While the spec don't appear to have changed this one drives better and has more consistent power than the 2015 I drove.

"04  2, 2018",First Toyota for Me,I purchased my first Toyota on Saturday and it was the RAV4 Hybrid - so far I enjoy it.  I really like the 38 - 40 MPG in it.  I was very pleased with the interior - the only improvement I wish the lower based models came with heated seats as standard.
"04  2, 2018","Toyota loyal, first RAV 4!","Believe this be a really good purchase, but time will tell. Really like the look of the 2018 models and estimated gas mileage. If it performs as well or better than the other Toyota?s we have owned; it will be on the road for long time."
"04  1, 2018",Multi purpose vehicle,"Happy previous Toyota owner.  The RAV4 is an excellent multi
 purpose vehicle that is good looking, gives good performance,  is economical, fun to drive, and lastly, reliable."

"04  1, 2018",I can only say the car is beautiful inside and out,"So far so good , everyone has liked it. Has plenty of room Not much else I can say I have only drove 55 miles, but it is very comfortable"
"03 31, 2018",Love my Rav,"I love driving the car, it is snappy and feels like I am driving it instead of the car is driving me. The only suggestion I would say, is they need to make the passenger size seat the same adjustments as the driver seat with the lumbar support."
"03 31, 2018",Fits me. Fits my needs. Does it with style.,"I traded in my 2001 Camry XLE, which still would have gone another 100,000 miles, for a new RAV4 Hybrid. I test drove it and others, read reviews, utilized Consumer Reports, and settled on one of the top cars for reliability, longevity, and comfort in its class. As I?ve aged my needs for comfort and reliability have changed, as well as my desire to travel. This car has so many desirable amenities it does some of the driving itself. My new 2018 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD SUV is what I want in a new professional and family vehicle. We?ll be together for many, many miles and years to come."
"03 31, 2018",Bought a new vehicle,"Wife considering a new car, found exactly what she wanted in this vehicle.  Plenty of room, easy to enter and exit, good view of the road, loaded with safety features and extras.  Great value for the price.  She has had four previous Toyota cars from the same dealership, loved each one and no major maintenance issues, just minor routine maintenance."
"03 31, 2018",This car looking great on the front and the back.,The RAV4 I have is looking great from the inside and the out side.  Driving very smooth and save a lots of gasoline. Me and my wife love this RAV4 I recommend my family and friends to have one of this RAV4 in the future.

"03 30, 2018",The Best Car for the Money,This car meets all of my needs. It has space for carrying cargo in the rear hatchback area. It sits up high so I can easily see over the traffic ahead.

"03 22, 2018",Love it!,I love it. It is so comfortable to ride in. I loved my Camery but I hated to get in and out because it was so close to the ground. My RAV4 sits up higher and is so easy to get in and out.
"03 21, 2018",Like the 2017 upgrade,I like the tire off the back and the tailgate opening up instead of sideways. Still would like to see better gas mileage. It is a bit larger and boxier than my 2010. Still getting used to the handling. Not quite as zippy as my old model.
"03 21, 2018",Best Vehicle I've owned in a long time!,"Lots of room-smooth ride, heats up fast in winter.

Extremely reliable and trustworthy. The 2018 models have some amazing features but if I must say anything negative I will say that it was very disappointing that they moved the clock from it?s wide open place to on the screen but put nothing in its place. And now there is a long black bar with the whole middle blank (where the clock was) Disappointing to me but still an amazing vehicle that we highly recommend.
"03  9, 2018",Love it,"Meets my need for comfort, roominess, reliability, ease of maneuvering and safety.  Well designed with an amazing interior.  Several  creature comforts included.  Favorite is heated steering wheel"

"03  2, 2018",Love this car!!,I had a 2017 Rav 4 and was rear ended in a wreck that totaled mine!  I knew I wanted another Rav 4 to drive!!!
"02 28, 2018",drives like a sports car,"sporty, like the styling, like the idea of computers watching my driving. the interior is very stylish, smooth driving. plenty of room for us bigger folks. I like it"
"02 28, 2018",Great value SUV,"Love the new styling of the 2018 Rav4 SE interior (I just turned in my 2015 Rav4 LE lease). Its so comfortable, tight drive, has all the bells and whistles, and is a very comfortable and fuel efficient ride."
"02 28, 2018",Fun from delivery to this very moment,"This is a well designed, tastefully appointed vehicle which is simply delightful to drive and maneuver. The acceleration belies the fact that it is powered by a four cylinder engine. I have driven it ECO mode and have no difficulty staying within its boundaries. Really enjoy the vehicle and have already recommended it to potential buyers."

"02 23, 2018",NEW RAV4,"Bought a Toyota because of reliability of other models i owned and 2year toyotacare. This model rav4 xle 2018 had what we wanted,(after adding optional packages) but I was disappointed that the navigation was not integrated but was connected meaning you have to use your phone with an app. Also this model had no compass or garage door opener on the mirror."
"02 23, 2018",My 1st Toyota,"Just leased the new Adventure model. Really like the athletic look and rally stripe on the hood. Black painted rims againt the white body really turns heads on the street.The safety features come standard, which is a HUGE savings compared to similar models. The interior is large enough for my 6' 1"" frame and the interior cloth is better for me than hot/cold leather. Cold weather package is a welcome must have. The heated steering wheel is my fav.
Cons: Cell phone Holder is not big enough for my Galaxy S7 Edge, so it is useless. The radio and integrated Nav is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Competitors like Ford do a much better job. The Entune screen is too small at 6 in and others are 7-8 in.  Just not very happy with that feature and you must use your cell data plan for the Nav. Big miss here, Toyota. Just can't seem to get used to that one."
"02 20, 2018",Toyota continues to be the standard,"This is my third consecutive RAV4 lease. I am extremely happy with my RAV4. The RAV4 is still the best value for your dollar. Safety, handling, MPG, reliability, purchase price, and the features available are all great. For my needs, I will continue to look at the RAV4 first."
"02 18, 2018","Comfortable,Roomy enjoyable driving experience",I am loving my RAV4. It is fun to drive and visibility to me seems excellent. Loving that I can make and receive cars without even touching my phone. My mom is always with us and we have a comfortable Roomy  ride.way to go Toyota...

"02 16, 2018",3rd Rav 4,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 I have bought and they just keep getting nicer. Was really sad when they stopped putting the V6 in them, but the current 4 cylinder is very peppy. And the new Adventure trim looks really sharp. Have owned Toyota's for the last 15 years or more. Can't beet the reliability and value."
"02 14, 2018",Toyota Rav 4 Hybrid a Definite Winner!,"Everything about this vehicle speaks comfort and reliability while maintaining an environmentally-friendly footprint. An excellent choice for a family, solo traveler or anyone who is looking for a fun and an ecologically-smart vehicle."
"02 12, 2018",Decent,The dash board makes me feel like it is larger than it is.  Personally like Honda feel more like a car.
"02 12, 2018",Nice comfortable car,"It's a comfortable car. My version has all the extras you might need, although the integrated navigation system is not that good. Mileage is not great either."
"02 12, 2018",Hands down best vehicle I?ve owned,Love the way it handles and drives. Plenty of room in back seat for my grandson and with all the saferty features and airbags I feel very good about our safety! I?ve never been happier with a vehicle.  I?ve owned Toyota?s for the past 25 yrs I can tell you they are the best on the market
"02  9, 2018",Love my rav4,I love how the seats hug your body. The lane departure monitor is amazing. It?s peppy for a 4 cyl. I traded my 12 Jeep Wrangler in for this car and I?m so glad I did.
"02  9, 2018",More pickup than I expected in Eco Mode,"Good: really pleased with the gas mileage (between 20 and 30 mpg around town, depending on traffic and route); has brake assist and lane departure, among other things, as standard safety features; has more pickup than I expected from a 4-cylinder, even in Eco Mode
Bad: Most cars I've driven have a little drawer/compartment to the left of the steering wheel where I like to put my mail key, but this doesn't have one
I've only owned this for two days, so this is a first impression."
"02  8, 2018",Love all the gadgets!,This car makes me feel safe with all the added things that come standard.  You definitely get more for your money with all of the things that other standard cars  don?t come with.
"02  7, 2018",I love my Adventurer,"So far the vehicle is exceeding my expectations. The ride is Sporty, yet very smooth and comfortable. I am getting great gas mileage and acceleration. I can't wait to wait take a camping trip to Moab in my Adventurer. Love the exterior side molding and bumper protection. The overall look is smart, sassy and makes my feel like a kid with a new toy. What fun!"
"02  7, 2018",You'll love the RAV4 !,"My wife and I each have one (her's is a 2016) and we're very happy with them.  Compact enough, but also big enough.  Plenty of cargo space in the back."
"02  7, 2018",Bought after much research,"Great car if you looking for small/medium SUV. All 2018 trims of RAV4 come with great safety features including TSS which includes lane departure alerts. The interior quality can be improved, but overall best value for the price,"

The sunroof. The heated seats and steering wheel.
Love love loveee."

"02  6, 2018",Nice small SUV.,I purchased a RAV4 Adventure with all options except the cold weather package (The closet Adventure with the cold weather package was several hundred miles away).  But  there is no built-in garage door  opener.  I have to keep a garage door opener in the console and I find this extremely inconvenient.  Every vehicle my wife and i have owned over the past 15 years has had a built-in garage door opener.  The radio speakers sound terrible and I have the premium package.  But all in all I love the Adventure.  We're leasing a 2015 Sienna and we will be purchasing a 2018 Sienna in July.  We're very happy with Toyota.
"02  5, 2018",Most versatile,"A great car for the many changes of life. Provides ample room, gas mileage and styling for a beginning family.  Features and options for the money spent are amazing and unlike any other brand."
"02  5, 2018",First new car in 10 years,"Plenty of room inside, attractive interior and exterior, plenty of features and safety uprgrades that weren't present in my previous car.  Rides smoothly and has a lot of power.  Can't recommend a better vehicle."

Toyota. The staff is very friendly and helpful, They answered.

This is the first RV I have had and I really enjoy driving it.
The car handles very good. The people who ride with me say that the car has a very smooth ride. I like all of the features that are on the car. I really enjoy the ease of driving."
"02  1, 2018",Great vehicle,"RAV4 is perfect for our situation, often needing a little more cargo space.  My wife loves how it drives and that it's not too big and has all of the safety features she could want.  Looks great too in black on black."
"02  1, 2018",Most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"I absolutely love all the features this car comes with. The backup camera, the lights on the side mirrors that let me know when someone is in my blind spot, the lane departure warning, and the multi zone climate control are a few of my favorites."
"02  1, 2018",First new car in very long time,This is first new vehicle I've gotten in very long time. Car is very stable and feels bigger than it is.
"01 31, 2018",Most reliable car I've owned,This is a great car with lots of storage and leg room. It handles very well in bad Vermont winter weather and often times find myself going places that other cars can not. I love how this car handles and its a smooth ride.
"01 31, 2018",Love!!,"I'm very impressed with the Rav4 so far!! It's a great, reliable car, that gets amazing gas mileage & has a very, clean, sleek interior!!"
"01 31, 2018",Best SUV for the Money,The safety features in the RAV 4  sold me on this vehicle . The ride is smooth and comfortable with plenty of room for my family.
"01 30, 2018",Too cool and fun,Purchased for my wife. Loves it. Great mileage and fun to drive. Sporty.  Has wonderful options.  Traded a 2016 in and got a step up for almost an even trade.  Toyota holds its value!
"01 30, 2018",Love my new car!,"This car has everything we could have wanted, and things we didn?t even know we could get! Extremely happy with our purchase."
"01 29, 2018",Great options with plenty of room,"Currently leasing, lots of leg room in both the  front and back. Real time all wheel drive is outstanding in the snow. Cargo area has room but wish it had storage space underneath, overall a good ride."
"01 28, 2018",All the bells and whistles!!!,"I love this SUV!! It is very comfortable to be in since it has leather heated seating. It has a 360 bird?s view camera which helps me with parking, going reverse, and making sure I?m safe!! Absolutely love every thing about it!"
"01 27, 2018",Toyota owner for over 40 years,"My husband and I have owned Toyotas for over 40 years.  We presently drive a 2014 Rav4 LE and a 2017 Rav4 XLE.  We looked at the 2018 Rav4 and found it to be not much different than the 2017 we already have.  Overall you cannot beat the Rav4 for dependability, style, comfort and performance.  The only cons that we have found with both of our Rav4s is the backup camera is pretty useless on sunny days because of the angle of the viewing screen, it would be nice to have a light on the driver door lock switch button like you did in previous models and please offer a choice of interior color in the LE model.  Other than those 3 exceptions, Toyota does a great job and we will continue to buy their cars."
"01 27, 2018",Rav 4 2018,This SUV has phenomenal safety features at a very fair cost compared to the Honda CRV and other coveted compact SUVs.
"01 27, 2018",Most reliable car,I love my RAV4 very much.  It?s very roomy inside and I love the exterior design!

"01 25, 2018",Rav4 way to go,I love the backseats and the awd in the snow but not only that it nice and clean. The matching color make it look beautiful. love the 2018 rav4!
"01 25, 2018",Love all the new features on the new Toyota Rav 4.,"We liked how smooth the car drove. Liked all the new features. Second day we bought the car we were driving in the poconos, a car flew close by us and warned us not to turn the wheel. It prevented us from hitting the side of the other car."
"01 24, 2018",My Wonderful New Car,"I love how it drives, still learning all the features. The lane detection is awesome even when the people driving along get scared."
"01 24, 2018",Our 9th toyota,"Our RAV4 has performed very well and we consider an excellent buy for the money.

"01 24, 2018",This has met all of our needs in a pleasent way,"This RAV4 has provided space for my husbands wheelchair and anything I buy with the money that I saved on this purchase. Comfort, safety, ease in dealing with the staff during the buying. The ease of it all has been pleasant."

But before we signed on the dotted line. We decided to test drive the Toyota Rav4. After the drive and seeing what features came with the Rav we never made it back to the Subaru dealership.

The corolla my sister took it so she could drive to college back and forth.In the mean time I purchased a celiaca, what a nice car... I didn?t keep it long because I got pregnant and it was too sporty.The Toyota celiaca went to my brother so he would be able to drive back and forth from college.

"11  8, 2017",Toyota?s Long lastimg and reliable,"Purchased a Toyota because my last 2005 Highlander had 137,000 miles on it in fabulous condition. It would have lasted easily another 137,000 in great condition. Certainly did not need a new car if not for a strange accident. Not a scratch but car was totaled. New Highlander was simply too large being single and older, wanted an all wheel drive vehicle live very rurally and an effectively all
Wheel drive vehicle essential. Prefer a SUV seat, giving you total view. Gas efficient and with size up over the years almost equal in interior space to my Highlander.  Gets great gas mileage. Extremely comfortable interior. And body color black currant is simply beautiful. This will most likely be the last car I own. Bought a limited  with every option functional available. Love this new car. It all has a distinctive body style, solid on the road,  quiet interior even at high speeds and you cannot hear road noise in the car. Really peppy, not a speeder but know getting it to over 90 is not a stretch Thrilled with my choice over Subaru, Nissan, Mazda and Volkswagon. And this car is built, over 85% in America. I will not buy a car not built here which eliminates all
American car makers. And many others. I support our workers who seem to be turning out really quality products. Price also a factor, best bang for the buck."

It's time to face adventure in the 2018 Toyota Rav4 AWD."
"11  2, 2017",Best Versatile Model,"I owned a 2009 Sport Rav4, it was perfect, served me very well. So when it came time to replace going with the same but updated version wasn't a question.

"03  2, 2018",LOVE the RAV 2018,The 2018 Rav is GREAT!  The expanded leg room in the front was definitely a plus.  Love all the new features Toyota has put in this vehicle!
"03  2, 2018",Love this car!!,I had a 2017 Rav 4 and was rear ended in a wreck that totaled mine!  I knew I wanted another Rav 4 to drive!!!

"02 28, 2018",Great value SUV,"Love the new styling of the 2018 Rav4 SE interior (I just turned in my 2015 Rav4 LE lease). Its so comfortable, tight drive, has all the bells and whistles, and is a very comfortable and fuel efficient ride."
"02 28, 2018",Fun from delivery to this very moment,"This is a well designed, tastefully appointed vehicle which is simply delightful to drive and maneuver.

"02 23, 2018",NEW RAV4,"Bought a Toyota because of reliability of other models i owned and 2year toyotacare. This model rav4 xle 2018 had what we wanted,(after adding optional packages) but I was disappointed that the navigation was not integrated but was connected meaning you have to use your phone with an app. Also this model had no compass or garage door opener on the mirror."
"02 23, 2018",My 1st Toyota,"Just leased the new Adventure model. Really like the athletic look and rally stripe on the hood. Black painted rims againt the white body really turns heads on the street.The safety features come standard, which is a HUGE savings compared to similar models. The interior is large enough for my 6' 1"" frame and the interior cloth is better for me than hot/cold leather. Cold weather package is a welcome must have. The heated steering wheel is my fav.
Cons: Cell phone Holder is not big enough for my Galaxy S7 Edge, so it is useless. The radio and integrated Nav is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Competitors like Ford do a much better job. The Entune screen is too small at 6 in and others are 7-8 in.  Just not very happy with that feature and you must use your cell data plan for the Nav. Big miss here, Toyota. Just can't seem to get used to that one."
"02 20, 2018",Toyota continues to be the standard,"This is my third consecutive RAV4 lease. I am extremely happy with my RAV4. The RAV4 is still the best value for your dollar. Safety, handling, MPG, reliability, purchase price, and the features available are all great. For my needs, I will continue to look at the RAV4 first."
"02 18, 2018","Comfortable,Roomy enjoyable driving experience",I am loving my RAV4. It is fun to drive and visibility to me seems excellent. Loving that I can make and receive cars without even touching my phone. My mom is always with us and we have a comfortable Roomy  ride.way to go Toyota...

"02 16, 2018",3rd Rav 4,"This is my 3rd Rav 4 I have bought and they just keep getting nicer. Was really sad when they stopped putting the V6 in them, but the current 4 cylinder is very peppy. And the new Adventure trim looks really sharp. Have owned Toyota's for the last 15 years or more. Can't beet the reliability and value."
"02 14, 2018",Toyota Rav 4 Hybrid a Definite Winner!,"Everything about this vehicle speaks comfort and reliability while maintaining an environmentally-friendly footprint. An excellent choice for a family, solo traveler or anyone who is looking for a fun and an ecologically-smart vehicle."
"02 12, 2018",Decent,The dash board makes me feel like it is larger than it is.  Personally like Honda feel more like a car.
"02 12, 2018",Nice comfortable car,"It's a comfortable car. My version has all the extras you might need, although the integrated navigation system is not that good. Mileage is not great either."
"02 12, 2018",Hands down best vehicle I?ve owned,Love the way it handles and drives. Plenty of room in back seat for my grandson and with all the saferty features and airbags I feel very good about our safety! I?ve never been happier with a vehicle.  I?ve owned Toyota?s for the past 25 yrs I can tell you they are the best on the market
"02  9, 2018",Love my rav4,I love how the seats hug your body. The lane departure monitor is amazing. It?s peppy for a 4 cyl. I traded my 12 Jeep Wrangler in for this car and I?m so glad I did.
"02  9, 2018",More pickup than I expected in Eco Mode,"Good: really pleased with the gas mileage (between 20 and 30 mpg around town, depending on traffic and route); has brake assist and lane departure, among other things, as standard safety features; has more pickup than I expected from a 4-cylinder, even in Eco Mode
Bad: Most cars I've driven have a little drawer/compartment to the left of the steering wheel where I like to put my mail key, but this doesn't have one
I've only owned this for two days, so this is a first impression."
"02  8, 2018",Love all the gadgets!,This car makes me feel safe with all the added things that come standard.  You definitely get more for your money with all of the things that other standard cars  don?t come with.
"02  7, 2018",I love my Adventurer,"So far the vehicle is exceeding my expectations. The ride is Sporty, yet very smooth and comfortable. I am getting great gas mileage and acceleration. I can't wait to wait take a camping trip to Moab in my Adventurer. Love the exterior side molding and bumper protection. The overall look is smart, sassy and makes my feel like a kid with a new toy. What fun!"

"02  6, 2018",Nice small SUV.,I purchased a RAV4 Adventure with all options except the cold weather package (The closet Adventure with the cold weather package was several hundred miles away).  But  there is no built-in garage door  opener.  I have to keep a garage door opener in the console and I find this extremely inconvenient.  Every vehicle my wife and i have owned over the past 15 years has had a built-in garage door opener.  The radio speakers sound terrible and I have the premium package.  But all in all I love the Adventure.  We're leasing a 2015 Sienna and we will be purchasing a 2018 Sienna in July.  We're very happy with Toyota.
"02  5, 2018",Most versatile,"A great car for the many changes of life. Provides ample room, gas mileage and styling for a beginning family.  Features and options for the money spent are amazing and unlike any other brand."

"02  1, 2018",Great vehicle,"RAV4 is perfect for our situation, often needing a little more cargo space.  My wife loves how it drives and that it's not too big and has all of the safety features she could want.  Looks great too in black on black."
"02  1, 2018",Most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned,"I absolutely love all the features this car comes with. The backup camera, the lights on the side mirrors that let me know when someone is in my blind spot, the lane departure warning, and the multi zone climate control are a few of my favorites."
"02  1, 2018",First new car in very long time,This is first new vehicle I've gotten in very long time. Car is very stable and feels bigger than it is.

"01 29, 2018",Great options with plenty of room,"Currently leasing, lots of leg room in both the  front and back. Real time all wheel drive is outstanding in the snow. Cargo area has room but wish it had storage space underneath, overall a good ride."
"01 28, 2018",All the bells and whistles!!!,"I love this SUV!! It is very comfortable to be in since it has leather heated seating. It has a 360 bird?s view camera which helps me with parking, going reverse, and making sure I?m safe!! Absolutely love every thing about it!"
"01 27, 2018",Toyota owner for over 40 years,"My husband and I have owned Toyotas for over 40 years.  We presently drive a 2014 Rav4 LE and a 2017 Rav4 XLE.  We looked at the 2018 Rav4 and found it to be not much different than the 2017 we already have.  Overall you cannot beat the Rav4 for dependability, style, comfort and performance.  The only cons that we have found with both of our Rav4s is the backup camera is pretty useless on sunny days because of the angle of the viewing screen, it would be nice to have a light on the driver door lock switch button like you did in previous models and please offer a choice of interior color in the LE model.  Other than those 3 exceptions, Toyota does a great job and we will continue to buy their cars."
"01 27, 2018",Rav 4 2018,This SUV has phenomenal safety features at a very fair cost compared to the Honda CRV and other coveted compact SUVs.
"01 27, 2018",Most reliable car,I love my RAV4 very much.  It?s very roomy inside and I love the exterior design!

Interior is a sea of plastic . Steering is overboosted . Absolutely  no fun at all driving this car . I can't wait til my lease is up .( wife likes it ,but she's not a car person)."
"01 16, 2018","Amazing Car, Great Price","This car was a trade in for my 2015 RAV4. Not sure I?ll ever leave the RAV, it is such an amazing car for the price. Rides great, stylish inside and out and very comfortable."

My main complaint about the vehicle is it's bumpy ride.  I also didn't like the interior controls keys.  They are too small.

"11 26, 2017",This is the 7th Toyota I have owned,"A great and reliable car. I am proud to own another Toyota! The other Toyota?s were a Corolla that went to 230,000 miles, a T-100, and two Tundras."

"11 22, 2017",Super safe feeling,"My RAV4 xle gives me a great safe feeling while driving. You are sitting up and have a great view of everything around you. I am super impressed with the safety features that my rav4 has. The blind spot warning is fabulous. Other safety features I am impressed with are the crash warning signal and intuitive breaking, the cross back up warning and also the intuitive cruise control. The car makes me feel that it is actually watching out for me to keep me safe. The moon roof gives you that little extra for those warm beautiful nights. All around I highly recommend the rav4 xle to anyone wanting a solid, safe vehicle foe the family"
"11 21, 2017",Nice RAV4,"Traded our 2011 Rav4 for this 2018 Rav4 Limited and we are giggling at all the little things this vehicle does. The lane changing radar helps so much to reduce neck pain from my bad neck. We know about the reliability of Toyota so we feel safe on the roads. Smooth ride so far, less than 1000 miles on it."
"11 21, 2017",There Getting  Better Every Year,"Toyota  keeps improving them, love all the safety features, stylish for a SUV.  Like the AWD, good gas mileage.  Would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a SUV"

"11 16, 2017",This car has all the room I need!,This car has made such a difference. It's trunk space is perfect for daily supplies as well as grocery shopping and bringing bikes to the park. The outside body of the car has a slick and clean look. Toyota Safety Sense allows me to feel safe when transporting my family. I would highly recommend this car for families with kids.
"11 16, 2017",toyota,Meets my needs Happy with it.  I would recommend  to anyone. Has good leg room and is easy to operate. I like the gas mileage. Most important to me is all the safety features.
"11 14, 2017",Love it!,"Love the way the RAV4 handles, the room for both passengers and cargo and the stylish look.  I can see many years of enjoying it ahead!"
"11 12, 2017",New Car love it so far,My daughter has a RAV4 she recommended I purchase this car since I need a car. Had my Camry XLE for 15 years. Love Toyotas so I went with the RAV4 2018.  Great purchase/lease.
"11 11, 2017",My new Rav4,My wife and I wanted a new car this year. We started out focused on a Subaru Forester.  We did test drive and formulated numbers for cost. But before we signed on the dotted line. We decided to test drive the Toyota Rav4. After the drive and seeing what features came with the Rav we never made it back to the Subaru dealership.  We signed and came home with the XLE model. Push button start sunroof and many more features to list. The Rav 4 is a solid guiet smooth riding SUV. It's a great choice !
"11 11, 2017",Toyota is the best car for your money,"Ever since I got my license and. Could afford to buy a car. , Toyota was my choice. My first car in 1978 was a corolla. That car lasted for ever. I drove everywhere with that car work,school,long distance trips. After I was done with. The corolla my sister took it so she could drive to college back and forth.In the mean time I purchased a celiaca, what a nice car... I didn?t keep it long because I got pregnant and it was too sporty.The Toyota celiaca went to my brother so he would be able to drive back and forth from college. In the mean time I made many mistakes buying and leasing cars that did not pan out at all. Finally I went back to my first love. Toyota. My family is now a TOYOTA family"
"11 10, 2017",Safe car to drive,This car met my needs. Easy to drive in winter. Too spacious. Interior looks too good. Too safe. Good features.
"11 10, 2017",She's my 1st Amore!,Great ride! Great red color! I don't get very excited over cars but she does excite me. On top of that I got a really good deal for her.
"11  8, 2017",Lots of bells and whistles and safety features,Great looking and comfortable and love all the safety features. It is an upgrade from the Rav 4 we had before
"11  8, 2017",Toyota?s Long lastimg and reliable,"Purchased a Toyota because my last 2005 Highlander had 137,000 miles on it in fabulous condition. It would have lasted easily another 137,000 in great condition. Certainly did not need a new car if not for a strange accident. Not a scratch but car was totaled. New Highlander was simply too large being single and older, wanted an all wheel drive vehicle live very rurally and an effectively all
Wheel drive vehicle essential. Prefer a SUV seat, giving you total view. Gas efficient and with size up over the years almost equal in interior space to my Highlander.  Gets great gas mileage. Extremely comfortable interior. And body color black currant is simply beautiful. This will most likely be the last car I own. Bought a limited  with every option functional available. Love this new car. It all has a distinctive body style, solid on the road,  quiet interior even at high speeds and you cannot hear road noise in the car. Really peppy, not a speeder but know getting it to over 90 is not a stretch Thrilled with my choice over Subaru, Nissan, Mazda and Volkswagon. And this car is built, over 85% in America. I will not buy a car not built here which eliminates all
American car makers. And many others. I support our workers who seem to be turning out really quality products. Price also a factor, best bang for the buck."
"11  8, 2017",Love this car!,Plenty of room. Smooth ride. Great gas mileage. Love the XM radio. Perfect for trips. Everything we needed in one vehicle. Great price
"11  8, 2017",Toyota reliability,The Toyota Rav4 is big enough to haul items but small enough to have a tight turning radius & great fuel efficiency. Roomy back seat too.
"11  7, 2017",Good little suv  for the money.,Very nice little suv! Big improvement since the last one I owned which was a 2009 rav4. The ride is so much smoother and the interior is much nicer. And good on gas too.
"11  7, 2017",Toyota4Me,"Great vehicle, great value, and I love all the safety features! This is my third Toyota and I am a satisfied consumer again. I would certainly recommend this car to others."
"11  5, 2017",Good car,"Very good for my necessity ,  good family size. 
I? love the color that I choose. I? had the Santa Fe before and the rav4 look more better."
"11  2, 2017",Toyota Rav4 AWD Magnetic Grey Metallic/ Black Int,"Wow. What a beaut. A majestic piece of modern day driving art suited to meet a road enthusiasts wildest dreams (or a family guy). Feels great. Handles well, and hey, if you like being green, it even has an EV version! Will leave you enthused (but not too much) every time you take a step out of the vehicle. It's time to face adventure in the 2018 Toyota Rav4 AWD."
"11  2, 2017",Best Versatile Model,"I owned a 2009 Sport Rav4, it was perfect, served me very well. So when it came time to replace going with the same but updated version wasn't a question. It's grown with me from a high school student, to college, to starting a family, to bringing a baby home. I know it will fit another car seat perfectly so there's room to grow. I recommend this car to everyone"
"10 31, 2017",Great economical SUV,Great car for the money. Came with tons of standard features compared to the competition. I would definitely recommend this car to others looking for a small SUV with great gas mileage.

"10 23, 2017",I love Toyotas!,I love everything about my Rav 4 Adventure. From the way it looks to the way it drives!  It is super comfortable and handles great.

Great. Package. Value.  For money
One step up from xle. Smart choice"
"10 19, 2017",Worth the money!  RAV4 XLE,"Worth every penny!  Super comfortable, elegant and sporty at the same time.  Lots of features, soft driving.
Powerful engine, many security features, driver's assist.  Traction control, Eco Friendly, Great Mileage.
Bought mine Galactic Aqua.  Awesome color.  You don't see many around."
"10 18, 2017",2018 rav4,I love love love my new RAV4. My salesman Wayne Michealsen was so patient and understanding. It took me several months to finally decide to buy. He actually answered all of my questions without rerouting the answer to something I did not ask. Wow he even helped me move all of my stuff from one car into the other. Such a great guy! I'm sooo excited!
"10 16, 2017",My Second Rav 4,"As a previous Rav 4 owner, I can say this vehicle handled very well years ago, and now the new 2018 handles on the road even better. I have test driven several different vehicles recently, to see if any brand is good or better than the Toyota Rav 4. I have not found anything that comes close.  The easy feeling when driving, the comfortable ride this SUV offer not to mention great gas mileage is what I look for before purchasing. No more test driving for me Rav4 2018 is my choice!
Thanks Toyota"
"10 16, 2017",Very comfortable and I feel safe,"Rides well.  Very quiet.  Plenty of leg room and head room.  Back area is really roomy for hauling boxes, groceries, etc."
"10 13, 2017",Great SUV,"I just bought  a 2018 Toyota RAV 4 XLE. Excellent SUV so far, beautiful inside and out and I feel comfortable and safe with all the features. Love it so far!"
"10 12, 2017",Finally got one,"I've wanted one for awhile .  It was so easy to buy, I don't know what took me so long.  Car has all the bells and whistles I could ever want."
"10  7, 2017",I've enjoyed my RAV4 Limited,"I could actually live in it. Great stereo, nice leather seats and seat warmers. Sun/moon roof. O and the stereo rewinds, pauses and fast forwards, you never miss anything. Like i said home away from home. I Love It!!!!!!
        Buy Toyota!!!
My husband got a Tundra. We r a Toyota Family"
"10  2, 2017",Amazing!,"This RAV4 is designed so sleek and wonderful- it looks like a space ship and drives so well. It's comfortable, roomy and designed perfectly. 4 people in my family have this because it's truly the best in the market"
"09 30, 2017",Upgraded from the 2011- new love affair going on h,Loving this vehicle- definitely worth the price! Got everything I wanted in a smaller SUV with surprising upgrades!
"09 10, 2017",most reliable i ever use,"This car met all of my needs. It has plenty of legroom in the front and back, the ride is great compared to other cars. It has 3 USB ports."
"02 11, 2024",Easy SUV to drive and own.,"I’ve had this SUV for 1 1/2 years. I love it! Is is fun and easy to drive. It is comfortable and has adequate space for 4 passengers. We sometimes haul 5, but the backseat gets tight for that. Mine is getting approximately 29 mpg on midgrade fuel.  Love the pushbutton start, lane keep assist, blind spot monitor, controls on steering wheel, rear hatch open and shut buttons, hands free talk, and huge display screen. Toyota could do better with the door handle touch to lock and unlock. Mine don’t work as well as expected. It also has a very annoying ding to warn when the roads may be icy that we apparently cannot turn off. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 on performance due to acceleration rate. It makes big noise like it’s going somewhere, but doesn’t really accelerate exceptionally well. It also shifts oddly sometimes. I notice it mostly when you slow down, but don’t stop ( think yield sign). It will jerk pretty hard when you accelerate from low speed. Overall it is a great little SUV with many bells and whistles for it’s price point. It feels very safe and reliable."
"02  4, 2024",Bad transmission,"Garbage.  Transmission failed at 89,000.  Hard to even find a shop to work on it.  Dealership wants almost half of car price to replace the transmission."
"12 28, 2023",My step forward,"After having my Kia Soul stolen 2 times, the second time they totaled it, I wanted a good coar with better safety features. I got the Toyota, and I have had no regrets at all. Drives great, gives good gas milage, and performance, Starts right up, and offers the features I want in a car."
"10 10, 2023",Bait and Switch at 21 Century Auto Group in NJ,"This 21 Century Auto Group in NJ employed a crafty bait-and-switch maneuver that left me both frustrated and disillusioned. To my astonishment, they had not disclosed on their website or to Carfax that the car they were selling had a salvaged title. It's clear that their claims, whether on their website or Cars.com, should be taken with a grain of skepticism. In a disheartening twist, I undertook a grueling three-hour journey to reach their location, only to discover that the RAV4 they were offering had indeed been in an accident, a crucial detail that they conveniently left unreported to maintain its 'clean title' façade. Once there, they made no bones about upselling me to a different, pricier vehicle. An experience that serves as a stark reminder to stay vigilant when dealing with such dealerships!"
"06  8, 2023",Disappointing purchase,"The seats on the newer Toyota RAV4 are very uncomfortable. Cannot adjust the driver seat like the older RAV4.  The seat has fewer adjusting knobs. The front design of the car is too high and bulky. definitely do not like the fact that you can’t move the rear seats. When you put the rear seats down to create more cargo space, they do not go flat like the older RAV4. overall, I really dislike this year model."
"05 14, 2023",Sub standard for the new car features and service.,"no navigation feature available for XLE, per Toyota dealer. No Serious XM radio per Toyota dealer. Sub  standard safet feature compared to 2013 Chevy Equinox it replaced. Very poor Toyota after warrantee service from the local dealer. Dealer service is now refered to as the ""future sales prevention department."
"02 10, 2023",I can see why these are popular! Absolutely Great,"Absolutely love the RAV4, good space and a fierce exterior. The engine can be lagging at times and sound “tiny”. Overall, a great vehicle nonetheless!"
"12 18, 2022",Roof Rails 2019 Rav 4,"Roof Rails leaked and ruined headliner. Gas door clip broke. Only 14,000 miles. Fuel pump was recalled. Very dissatisfied with this vehicle overall . Poor quality."
"11 15, 2022",Happy buyer,"Reasonably priced runs great and performs excellent
Zero compliance
It’s a Toyota so it should run forever
The vehicle is very stylish, and perform as well off road"
"10 28, 2022",Great vehicle,"A great vehicle, I'm a good sized person, driver seats are kind of high even adjusted to the lowest level (electric seats) I have a hard time getting in. The only other item is I wish it had more power, it lags a little getting onto the highway."
"09 23, 2022",Bad gas mileage .,"Real gas Mpg  (Rav -4  ) for city  mileage is 21 mile per a gallon .again again test  more then 300 times 20-21 mile is correct , factory said 28 ml is not even close, so bad gas mileage on town , on Fwy mileage are better 31 mpg per gallon , engin is quite running  smooth , better then BMW X3 - very noise and running very hot (because turbo engin - not Recommend / I  had before) bmw is very hi maintenance car , Toyota RAV4 is good and easy maintenance vehicles. But Ford  hybrid  Maverick truck $20000  city40 mpg , Hwy 35 mpg - very strongly recommend  I’ll buy ford maverick hybrid  truck next time , very good on gas mileage compared to Tacoma  2.7 liter gas truck  - expensive truck . I have  2011 Toyota Camry  25/33 mpg on gas pretty reliable car  -Recommend ."
"08 16, 2022","2019 Limited Roof Rail leak at 28,000 miles","Our 2019 Limited experienced the unfortunate roof leak from under the roof rails just two months out of warranty.

At 38 months, the car had under 30,000 miles, had been garaged 100% of the time, and hand-washed 90% of the time. The roof rails were never used or modified in any way. If you search the web for ""RAV4 roof leak"" you'll find hundreds of owners who document the same problem.

The issue is caused by water getting under the roof rails and then getting through holes under the roof rails that are protected only by a thin rubber gasket and flimsy plastic trim clips.

We asked Toyota to cover the cost of replacing and reinforcing the roof rail seals and the resulting water damage/mold because of it.

Toyota, not so politely, declined, because the car was two months out of warranty. So, we decided to no longer be a Toyota customer. Likely for life.

We traded it in for a CR-V. Beyond the water-tight roof, the CR-V also has a softer and quieter ride and a smoother CVT.

The RAV4 is a pretty box, but by most other measures, we give the edge to the CR-V."
"07 20, 2022",Wonderful Car,"It fits my needs for everything I do. The Safety Features ensure that I’m safe and able to get home to my love ones. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn’t have lumbar support, and long drives can be a pain"
"05  5, 2022",Leaking roof racks.,"This is a follow-up to my previous review. Today I had to pay the ransom to get my car back from my local Toyota service department. The leaking roof racks were replaced and after a dealership discount of $175 and an alleged Toyota discount of around $366, my portion of the bill was $1,052 PLUS an additional $140 to diagnose the problem. This is a manufacturing defect that should have been paid for in-full by the Toyota Corporation. The dealership did all they could to help but the Toyota Corporation was indifferent. This should not have happened to a 3 1/2 year old car that was largely garage kept and accident free. Lesson learned. This Toyota customer is a one-and-done."
"06 17, 2021",Very reliable and comfortable and stylish.,Car has met all but one of our needs to date. Very economical to operate. Very nice that Toyota has 2 yr.no maintenance cost. Was disappointed after purchase there was no CD player available. This fact was never mentioned during buying process. I suspect Toyota knew this to be factor and advised sales lot to mention this. This will be a definite point for me to inquire about since we vacation requiring hours of driving and not a fan of channel surfing for the entire trip. But still happy with everything else about the vehicle.
"06  6, 2021",Great car,Best car we ever owned. Easy to get in and out of easy driving and parking good leg room and head room. I would recommend this rav4 to anyone.
"06  4, 2021",I love how sporty it looks!,It has the advanced safety features that I need. Its easy to drive plus I love how sporty it looks!. I love it! I recommend it to new drivers.
"05  9, 2021",Best vehicle I ever drove!,"This SUV is the best! I love the comfort, the ride and I feel very safe. I always drove sedans and never realized how great it is to drive a SUV."
"04 17, 2021",GREAT VALUE/PRICE AND GREAT LOOK,"The Toyota RAV4 met my wants and needs with a stylish look, Toyota dependability and solid performance.  It's great driving a vehicle that looks good and you have total confidence in!"
"04  6, 2021",Not safe to take on long trips.,This car has 8 recalls..many of them serious. I am afraid to take it on a long trip. I cant believe Toyota is so indifferent to this problem.
"03 31, 2021",NoToyota Reliably,"2019 Rav4 Limited AWD. First the torque vectoring unit replac ee's d, now the fuel pump recalled. Dealers condirm appointment,  brihng in car, they don't  have all parts neede. Parts doesnt communicate with Service dept. 6th Toyota, first one with problems, major on es."
"03  2, 2021",Love this vehicle!,So glad we got this. I went from a Ford Explorer and so happy I did! It also helps that we bought from an amazing dealer! They were so helpful in making our decision
"01 27, 2021",Best looking vehicle including reliability I have,Perfect in every way except for one complaint.  After approx 8 months the steering  began making a groaning and sometimes a clunk when turning the steering wheel at slow speed like when parking. Notified the dealer service dept that told me it is quite normal??..that it's the electric steering assist motor...weird.
"01 12, 2021",Great car and great gas mileage,Love the versatility and comfort of this vehicle. I have always been a loyal Toyota advocate. The quality of the product has always been outstanding.
"01 12, 2021",Our hybrid Rav4 is great,"The fuel mileage is super, the vehicle has plenty of get up and go on the highway, its comfortable and has many terrific safety features.  We only have one problem to report, one that has been widely recognized and for which Toyota is working on a solution. The fuel tank will not accept its full rated capacity.  We can only seem to get 10 gallons or so into it."
"01 12, 2021",fuel pump recall serious problem no fix,The fuel pump recall is a serious safety problem (according to corporate cust service)  without any known fix available.  So this very expensive fairly new car must sit unused. No resolution received
"01  6, 2021",Worst car I ever had,"Unfortunately worst car I ever had, due to this car I am done with Toyota forever. Driving is super uncomfortable, lousy, shifts looks like has issues, no idea what is doing."
"01  3, 2021",First Toyota I've owned.,Just learning all the many options on this vehicle.  Only had it 5 days so anxious to get acquainted with it. So far I love driving it & the way it handles.
"12 30, 2020",I hoping this will be my best car yet.,"I love it. It’s roomy, smooth on the road and more. I love the color and how sporty the car is. Thanks so much for your help."
"12 16, 2020",Loud and Choppy Transmission,My first Toyota gave me no problems for 20 years this one has given me two recalls in a major service issue in less than 18 months.
"12  8, 2020","Had several Toyotas, always reliable & dependable.","Instrument panel cumbersome & ride is not comfortable.  Dependable & great gas mileage. 
Panel readout is distracting & looks odd.  But would buy RAV again!"
"11 29, 2020",The road noise is very irritating on high driving.,"I bought Toyota because of their insistence that safety features are not a luxury option, and, also, I wanted reliability. We bought the Custom model and except for road noise, we are quite happy with it. That said, the road noise IS a big deal if your on a long high speed drive."
"11 13, 2020",Toyota Review,"The car is O K -- owned it 3 weeks . I am disappointed in the lack of  the Car Apple Play -- doesn't give you enough direction & lacks basic information like the name of streets you are passing and even the road you are on. No compass -- you would think that Toyota with car apple play would have a compass so you know what direction your going.. Lastly , doesn't give you the speeed limit when you are driving until a posted sign appears along the road your on,  Really need it  MUCH sooner than that. Why isn't it there as soon as you dive away? Expected more from Toyota -- too much not on the car that should be !!!!!"
"10 15, 2020",Very nice car to drive,"Was a very good purchase I love it, gas mileage it's awesome, have the room that I need for my kids, best vehicle I ever had"
"10  9, 2020",I use to love my Rav4,"Pros...Looks improved with the 2019 redesign. The screen is larger and easier to read. Cons...the floor board was raised but the headroom stayed the same. I am only 5’3” and have to duck to get in the car. The engine, tranny changed and it’s horrible. It’s a rough stiff ride and the engine is so loud now and the ride is jerky. We were given a $3,000 (as per dealers words) update to fix this known problem. The free fix did nothing. The car sounds and feels like it’s struggling to keep up with itself. This ride is the worst I’ve ever had and I’m a senior citizen. Toyota, please quit trying to save money and messing with things that were great features! I wish I could get my 2015 RAV4 back. It was quiet and awesome!"
"10  2, 2020",Proud to be driving a Rav 4.,"Enjoying the sleek, sporty modern style of the Rav 4.
Happy to use regular gas for the savings. I use the roomy back area for transporting cumbersome items ."
"09 18, 2020",Full Optioned Price; Many Options Missing,Bought a Limited Hybrid. No TPMS. Driver memory option poor. Power passenger seat poor. Simply not equipped as a high end optioned car should be.
"09 11, 2020",Great car,I did a lot of research on small to mid size SUV and the Rav was always in the top ten for reliability looks and maintenance cost.
"08 27, 2020",Great vehicle,I love my RAV4. It’s comfortable and extremely reliable. I use the ECO Mode and save a lot of money in gas. It’s also super quiet in the highway.
"08 25, 2020",Great small suv,"Indownsized from an Acura MDX to the rav 4 and have not been disappointed. The fuel economy is good, the audio system is great, and it contains all the features I wanted"
"08 23, 2020",Great Vehicle,"The RAV4 is a great vehicle. It looks good and performs well. It has room to hall gear for outdoor recreation. The interior is well designed, I am very happy with the RAV4 which I bought new last year."
"08 21, 2020",Very good and reliable car,Very good and reliable car. We are very happy with it. Unfortunately coronavirus deny us a pleasure to drive it more. Hopefully it will be over soon.
"08 20, 2020",Fabulous car,This is the first time I’ve ever brought a new car in for its one year service with not a single issue to report. I am very happy with this purchase.
"08 11, 2020",Great car,"People say it's loud but it's not really. If you plant your foot it is but under normal driving conditions, it's very quiet. The engine is smooth, the safety features are awesome and for long drives the adaptive cruise control really helps battle fatigue. Low cost of ownership also. If you look under the hood, there's plenty of room if it ever needs to be worked on, not that you will, it's a Toyota inline 4, these engines are bulletproof.
The 8 speed transmission takes a little getting used to, there's a small fault, where you can't plant your foot if the car is still rolling, It lurches forward, but hey, just apply your foot slowly to the accelerator and this problem just goes away."
"07 29, 2020",Toyota make great cars,This vechile met everything that I was looking for. If you think that the 4 cyclind are too slow for a car these cars have the up and go.  Very well made! Just love it!
"07 27, 2020",Most reliable car,my vehicle is visually appealing. Comfortable to drive and be in. looks a bit manly which i love. It a realizable family vehicle or single person. great on gas. My vehicle is reliable and durable. I am very pleased with my purchase!
"07 13, 2020",My forever car.,"I have been wanting an SUV for a while and I saw the outer body style of the RAV4 and LOVED it. I finally got in and test drove one and went back and bought 2 days later. It’s got just enough room, and isn’t too big. It is comfortable to drive, decent on gas, and smooth. I absolutely love this and my boyfriend does as well. It’s the perfect SUV."
"07 10, 2020",Awesome.,"Its perfect. The only issue is its need a very careful n skilled driver when in  cruising mode.and also when monouvering around shard corners at top speed. Also its eco mode is too slow i prefer driving on sport mode,its gives the engine more  power and is more stable.all in all,its a good SUV"
"07  8, 2020",I love my RAV4!,I haven’t driven it much since I just got it but I am over the moon thrilled with it so far! It’s a very smooth ride and visibility is great which is important to me as I am only 5’2” tall.
"07  8, 2020",Air conditioning system,A C System could be stronger and the vents are too narrow and small. Tough for texas. Love the black color. Get the XLE for the brake hold. LOVE MY CAR
"07  5, 2020",Came in on a corolla and left in a rav4,This car is there perfect fit for me. and spacious for the family. I am very content with my purchase ! I strongly recommend this car.
"06 28, 2020",Very excellent car to drive,"Can really recommend it to all, just visit dealership, and you are happy.
The team took care of me, and exceeded my expectations. Happy to say, that I am the owner of this vehicle."
"06 25, 2020",Like the styling and the functionality of a SUV,This is exactly what I was looking for and I had been searching for almost 5 weeks. Very pleased with the purchase. Even though it was used it was delivered to me in perfect condition.
"06 24, 2020",Great Vehicle for my needs,"I wanted a roomier vehicle to drive to work and pickup my kids from school.  I needed 30+ MPG but enough space for the family to fit comfortably.  I also wanted modern features like Bluetooth, rear camera, and adaptive driving controls.  This vehicle had all of that and the price was perfect.  Around town, I've been getting better than 30MPG and for a vehicle this size, that's amazing.  My only concern with the LE model is that the plastic on the bumpers might fade in the Florida sun.  But we'll see how it holds up.  So far, no complaints."
"06 20, 2020",Very reliable car,"I like the multiple ports, the Apple Car Play system and the excellent mileage and comfortable ride.   Love the automatic lift gate for loading groceries, luggage, etc."
"06  5, 2020",I chose the right one!,Out of all the compact SUV models the Toyota RAV4 beats them all. Its reliability and safety can't be beat. The interior styling has a far better and richer feel then most of the others and it has a solid Miss to it that I didn't notice test driving some of the others. I intend to keep this vehicle for a very long time!
"06  2, 2020","was excited to have a new driving experience , SUV","So far, so Good; Really enjoying bonding with my new member of the family. My Rav 4 is well behaved, fitting in and getting along with the other Toyota , quite nicely."
"05 28, 2020",Best car I ever had.,"A perfect car for families, or singles. Sophisticated all-wheel drive. Plenty of cubby storage, nice trimmed cabins, easy-to-fold rear seats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the RAV4 a five-star rating. Fuel economic. No accident, dent or scratch, or anything inside or outside. Free oil change and Roadside assistant until 07/2021 or 25k miles (ToyotaCare Factory Maintenance). Basic factory warranty coverage is until 07/2022 or 36k miles. Powertrain coverage is up to 07/2025 or 60k miles."
"05 23, 2020",Car Review,"This car was not on my radar when looking to but, drove by and decided to pull in...
Test drove the RAV4 and loved everything about it, had to have it.  Liked that you were not pressured into buying, Salesman (Blake) was terrific!"
"05 19, 2020",My favorite SUV out right now!!!,"I had gotten a 2018 CRV 9 months ago. From the moment I had it I started feeling dorky. I used to only drive Accord coupes but wanted something truck like for work. No matter what I did I felt like a soccer mom in the crv, and then came oil dilution issues so it had to go. 

I saw the redesigned RAV4 and immediately loved the more rugged look. This thing looks like an suv and not a mini van like so many suvs today. I love the interior as well and the speakers are night and day better than Honda. 

I chose charcoal gray and got black wheels and emblems. It looks so masculine and I 100% love it. Drives well too. 

I did have transmission reprogrammed so it doesn’t jerk out of first gear. Fixed it completely. It’s a great car and my favorite suv on road in price range."
"05 18, 2020",Must own,"There’s so much I could write about this car. First of all am 6”2 and it’s amazing how I can stretch my legs around. It had no mats on the floor, So I don’t know if it’s the new normal for these cars. You could ride this beast for the whole day with much comfort.5 star definitely."
"05 16, 2020",Best 4W car available with good price,"This is car is the best car you could get with affordable price with good fuel consumption, good interior and exterior design plenty of space inside good for family."
"05 16, 2020",Awesome vehicle,"This vehicle was exactly what I was looking for, it is perfect size for myself and my family. Not too big or bulky and very comfortable fit inside. The look and style are very nice as well."
"05 13, 2020",Third RAV4 I’ve owned!,"It’s pretty, full of safety features, and rides/handles very nicely. Easy transition to the newer version. I’ve always had great success with the RAV4 that this is my 3rd one and 4th Toyota."
"05 12, 2020",Too soon to tell,I am enjoying this car overall.  A little less power than I am used to. Comfortable and spacious. Love the design and look of the car.
"04 30, 2020",Extremely easy to handle and reliable,Great car and looks great . I love how I’m treated at the service center. Jenny is great to help me when I need help
"04 29, 2020",Nicest car I've owned!,Only thing I would change is more head room up front. Both seats need to be able to be moved up and down to allow room for a taller person to get inside without hitting their head. Otherwise I love my car!
"04 28, 2020",LOVE MY 2019 RAV4!,"I am amazed everyday at the technology and safety features that this car has!!! I love the lane assist, blind spot side mirrors, and APPLECARPLAY! I love love love, this car!"

"04 23, 2020",A dream car.,"I adore my RAV4. It is such a pleasure to drive, wonderfully reliable and comfortable. I use it to run errands  - i.e. grocery shopping - and to meet medical appointments. With the current coronavirus pandemic affecting all of our lives, and quarantine mandates in place, I've been very limited in how much I've been driving lately, but it's a great car and I can't wait for the day it's safe to hit the open road again and visit relatives in nearby states."
"04 17, 2020",Very dependable and great mileage for long trip,"Smaller 2nd car, very roomy for 4, adequate leg room and very reliable and a great commuter vehicle cle with low operational cost notably for work/home."
"03 31, 2020",Best vehicle I ever owned,"The RAV4 has always been my dream car , now I finally own it there is no other car to take its place. Comfortable, reliable, great looking, great on gas"

"03 17, 2020",My favorite car- Toyota RAV4,"This car definitely better for me because I have to drive approximately 70 miles a day and over rural roads.  I feel that it is safe and easy to handle on the roads. Also, get good gas mileage for the type of car it is.  Very comfortable and has everything that I need in a car."
"03 17, 2020",Safety features make this a great car to own.,Great car with an additional feature of the Moon Roof. Really enjoying the backup camera and other safety features. The ride is smoother and quieter than my previous RAV4
"03 15, 2020",Nice vehicle,Very nice SUV. A big upgrade from the previous body style. Much better gas mileage as well. Drives and rides so much better than previous models.
"03 14, 2020",Definitely value for money with comfort,Excellent safety features which provides comfort in navigating busy commutes in a metro area. Gas consumption very economical. Feels like luxury at an affordable cost
"03 12, 2020",This is my second RAV4 and I am very happy with it,"Easy to drive, good pick-up on Highway. Comfortable and has a lot of room. I especially like the back-up camera. I also like the screen location on the dashboard. Nice and big!"
"03  8, 2020",Comfortable and Reliable,"I decided to trade my 2016 Rav for the 2019. It was a good move. The car really drives itself. Very comfortable, easy to drive and really helps in windy conditions. The interior is very inviting and great to enter and exit."
"03  6, 2020",Worse car I ever had.,"I do not like the performance of this  vehicle at all  compared to pass SUV’s I’ve own. For the price I expected a better performance level. It has a bumpy ride, too noisy, slow pickup rate. I will never purchase another one. Not to mention two recalls."
"03  3, 2020",This is my.  Third RAV4 and not my last,"Love the new body styling,  Toyota keeps me coming back.  this is my third RAV4, I’m sure I will buy another one.   Thank you for reading this.."

"02 26, 2020",A pleasure to drive.,"So far the car has been great, except the remote start which is not factory but the dealer had installed prior to delivery is not functioning correctly."
"02 21, 2020","Great Value, Very Reliable!","I was between this and a CX-5, but I’m happy with my decision and would recommended to anyone looking for a practical use small/mid sized SUV."

Love the safety features and the IPHONE hook up to the screen to see my maps and apps right in front of me:)"
"02 17, 2020",Quick response,"Enjoy driving it. Very sporty, good gas mileage. Room for luggage as well as passengers. Traded my convertible because it did not have blue tooth or back up camera."
"02 16, 2020",The most disappointing car ever. Very unreliable,"The 2020 RAV4 replaced my 2018. Nice comfort but big cover-up of horrible transmission problems by the manufacture. This 8 peed transmission took this car from great 2018 to horrible 2020. Have no more patient to argue with Toyota over car problems that will just get worse over the years when the car get older.
Talking to RAV4 owner some afraid to leave bad reviews to their car not to create a bad name.
I would advise to stay away from the new RAV4."
"02  8, 2020",Good car with flaws,"I've owned the XLE model for 1 year now. For a car well over $30K, it has flaws. No GPS unless you have Iphone to use Iplay; when you plug in phone, it gets hot. If no cell service, no GPS (so get lost!); must use cable to one (only) usb port in center console (I hate having this set up). Big side mirrors don't auto fold when parked. Interior light buttons aren't illuminated; very hard to find them in dark. Creaking d's seat adjustment. Engine hesitation when you slow down and then want to speed up. No self-dimming mirror, and no garage door opener! Many of these features were available on my 2016 Mazda of $25K, including actual leather seats, not Toyota ""Leatherette"". There is an occasional squeaking sound up front when turning into uneven ground. Toyo mechs say ""nothing's wrong"". I've driven this car about 16K miles. 

On the positive, great mileage. Roomy (I'm 5.11)."
"02  8, 2020",Nice Car!,"Safe, reliable and comfortable.   Like the heated seats and Apple Car Play.  Maybe next time I will get the heated steering wheel.  Very comfortable on long trips."
"02  3, 2020",Absolutely love this car!,"Going from a 2016 kia soul to a 2019 Toyota rav4, I absolutely love this car! The ride is really smooth, its sporty and stands out! I now have my dream car!"
"01 31, 2020",My wife loves to drive it!,"This vehicle is a lot of fun to drive: sharp looking, comfortable and peppy!
Turns heads when you drive by.
It’s white with black trim and looks like a Star Wars Storm Trooper.
All other makes of similar vehicles were no doubt modeled after the RAV4!"
"01 28, 2020",Most reliable car  that I ever drive,"The car meet all my expectations since I’m short legged woman my car have that capacity that drivers seat can be lifted up that I can see better in front  it has camera , it beeps if you’re getting out of the lane ."
"01 16, 2020",Not my first Rav4 hope the lagging will go away,"Great vehicle, some what sluggish if enough acceleration is not give sound like it would shut off hoping no problem in the future style is ok I dress"
"01 14, 2020",Toyota Dependability Glistens,"SPIRITED comfortable drive but road noise is disappointing. At 60mph was able to get 39mpg.
Customer should demand at least 4k off MSRP or walk to Subaru or Honda."
"01  8, 2020",Not very comfortable,"The drivers seat is not very comfortable.  my leg would start hurting if I drove for more than 20 minutes.  Also, the front end radar will slow you down unexpectedly, making it hard to pass cars on the freeway.  It also has a lot of annoying dinging alarms if you do shut down correctly each time... ie.  if you do not put it in park before you shut off the engine, it will ding at you constantly even after putting it in park... its enough to xxxx you off every time you drive the car."
"01  8, 2020",Worst car we have ever owned,"Worst car we have ever owned.  bad transmission. bad heat controls.
bad mileage. bad engine. just all around not worth the cost!!  will not buy Rav4 ever again!!"
"01  4, 2020",Great looking and affordable,"This was a great choice for me and my family neede a suv instead of a huge pickup truck ,,,, rides great and operates great"
"01  4, 2020",Lunar Rock RAV 4,I am a repeat Toyota car buyer and especially appreciate my dealership. This car is stylish and functional. Gas mileage has been great. There are a few quirks and the phone downloads still don't work correctly. I find the electronics a little cumbersome.
"01  3, 2020",One of the best car I have been driving,Excellent very reliable and good gas mileage very convenient and gas enough power and a roomy trunk the ac and the screen are big and easy to use
"01  1, 2020",Love the look & features in my new SUV!,I love the body style & interior of my new RAV4. There’s a ton of new safety features & the navigation system is phenomenal! Very comfortable & roomy!
"01  1, 2020",Very comfortable vehicle to drive,"This RAV 4 met all my expectations, especially the safety procedures. Very sleek exterior, full visibility and very comfortable ride. Very roomy interior. Great construction as always."
"12 29, 2019",This is my second RAV4,"I made a poor decision years ago to sell my beloved RAV4. Well, today I have a new RAV4 in my life, and I'm sticking with it! It is simply the best designed car year after year for a family on the go."
"12 28, 2019",Defective transmission,New 8 speed transmission is defective. Software fix does not help it. Very jerky and pushes you when trying to stop. Interior is dated and the tech is last generation.
"12 28, 2019",My sixth Toyota. Till now they have been super.,"I have owned a Camry, 2 Highlanders, a previous RAV 4 and my current 
2019 RAV 4 XLE. I still own a 2003 Echo with 70000 miles. The present RAV 4 is an utter disappointment not to mention In feel unsafe. At slow speeds and from a standstill it will lurch forward. This is an unexpected intermittent event that has come close to hitting a car in front of me. The engine is very noisy on acceleration. The radio is a joke a total waste. The radio in our 2003 Echo is fantastic by comparison. When I complained to my dealer about the surge issue I was told that my car needed to learn how I drive and the surge should 
go away. I would love my trade in a 2011 Equinox back."
"12 28, 2019",Highest quality and best styled vehicle,"This SUV is the highest quality vehicle I have ever owned.  It was redesigned for 2019 and looks bigger and more impressive than ever!  I have the Limited with AWD, which will be great for driving on the Chicago snow.  The safety sensors really help me avoid accidents."
"12 27, 2019",Great safety features but transmission is an issue,"I leased a new RAV4 in April of 2019 and overall I love it. My last lease was a Corolla and this is my first SUV and there are so many great features. I travel back and forth from NC to Ohio a lot and I love the cargo space and the safety features.... blind spot monitors, radar cruise control, lane tracing assistant, lane departure, pre collision system, auto high beams, rear camera with cross traffic alerts... etc. These are all important features for me personally. I also think it’s roomy and comfortable and generally easy to drive. 

The biggest downfall is the 8 speed automatic transmission. I noticed some of the jerkiness during the test drive but didn’t think much of it and of course the salesman didn’t say anything about it. When you are slowing down whether it be in traffic, at a red light, etc. and then accelerate without coming to a complete stop, it will hesitate and then jerk forward. Even when you do come to a complete stop, the car will jerk as it abruptly downshifts around 4mph. Great car for highway driving and great gas mileage but this transmission issue is a bummer if you’re like me and have to sit in stop and go traffic on your commute to/from work each day. It makes for a jerky trip rather than a smooth ride. 

Also have to agree with several other reviews on the wind/road noise as well. While driving at higher speeds there is always a rattling noise on the drivers side- can’t tell if it’s the mirror or the window but it definitely is irritating. Also doesn’t have much power when accelerating and the engine can be very loud. 

Unless the transmission issue can be fixed at some point, I doubt that I will keep this car when my lease is up. Sad because it’s such a great car!"
"12 27, 2019",Worst Toyota I’ve ever owned,"I got the 2019 Rav 4 premium..... mistake. This cars exterior is beautiful love it the inside is subpar. I was like wow this car for 32,000 I’ll take it after seeing what all it had. I have owned 6 Toyota’s in 10 years. This one clearly wasn’t well thought out before production. It sounds like my 1995 civic when I step on the gas ( the Rav mind you it gets down the road) but it’s so loud and the bucking from stop to start is awful it honestly has given me whiplash. Glad the good comments but this car is such a disappointment unfortunately I just traded back in with 11,000 miles so I have drove it enough to know I hate it"
"12 25, 2019","Great car, but problem filling gas tank",Getting good milage with this 2019 RAV4 hybrid. But can only put 9.5 gallons in the 14.5 gallon tank when the low fuel light comes on. It should have 5 gallons left.  I am not sure if it would use the 5 gallons left in the tank or let me sit. Otherwise we love the car. I would recommend it after Toyota fixes the gas tank problem
"12 20, 2019",Most stylish Toyota I've ever owned.,"The Rav4 has met all my driving needs and is fun to drive except for the Entune 3.0 infotainment system, you need a newer Android or iPhone to use the system. Not everyone has the most current technology."
"12 20, 2019",RAV4 has improve and cost more and more!,"It is not a Highlander but it takes me everywhere but it is uncomfortable for long drives. No arm rest. 
This model has improved but it is not an affordable car anymore. As they improve it the prices are higher and higher."
"12 18, 2019",Toyota Camry,"Great car to own, great m per gallon and I’m very satisfied. Always buying Toyota very reliable brand and not expensive maintenance. Love Toyota SUV"
"12 17, 2019",2019 RAV4,"I purchased a new 2019 RAV4 XLE in Nov 2019. only driven 600 miles .
Engine is too loud on acceleration  .There is no insulation pad under the hood at all. There is gap between the head light and the hood. Rubber seal around the engine  compartment is very soft .  Door handle  is further far from the driver."
"12 15, 2019",Disappointed Toyota Customer,Seventh Toyota purchased and first disappointment.Underpowered with jerky transmission.If you have an android phone system not compatible with a very bad Entune/ map system.Want Sirius not available and if you are above average in size forget about the passenger seat. However with interior being so noisy you might not care about the bad audio system.I am coming from Outback Limited and will be returning when my lease is done here.
"12 13, 2019",This is my 3rd RAV 4,"This RAV 4 meets or exceeds all my needs and is my 3rd. Each year (3-year lease) quality, comfort, and technology improves. Reliability is outstanding and styling is very good."
"12 12, 2019",I’ve only had it two weeks but like everything,"Just what I wanted, have only driven it for two weeks, but if it is as reliable as it is supposed to be, all good"
"12 12, 2019",Good Car so far,"This car has enough leg room. It has 3 USB Port. The hybrid one saves a lot on gas, about $20 to fill the gas tank."
"12  9, 2019",Rav 4 meets my demands,"Love this SUV. I have had other RAV4 in the past and enjoyed them but this 2019 is far better and love all the great features, especially the safety features and cameras."
"12  6, 2019",I like the vehicle,No compass which is surprising since the vehicle is considered an adventure vehicle.  Choppy acceleration when not starting from a complete stop.  Limited closed compartment storage in vehicle and no cover screen for back storage included.
"12  6, 2019",GREAT VEHICLE,"Love the JBL sound system, heated steering wheel, great sight lines and fantastic interior. Looking forward to many years of ownership. This is the 5th RAV4 we owned."
"12  6, 2019",Toyota Is The Best Bang For Your Buck,"I was extremely torn between buying a new Jeep Compass Altitude FWD or the Toyota RAV4. I had previously ruled out the Chevy Blazer  due to it's higher price with less features and advantages. Yesterday, I purchased a RAV4 and couldn't have been more content with my decision. Although the Jeep looks super cool, there were a lot of negative reviews about its engines and overall durability....something you don't hear about Toyota.

I purchased the XL model of the RAV4, and although it's the base model, it's packed full of tons of features. Honestly, the only downside to the particular model I had was that it did not come with SiriusXM. However, it does have Apple Car Play, so I solved that problem in no time. I was able to use the SiriusXM app and stream the channels through my subscription and just have that play through Apple Car Play. Besides that, the coolest features that I've noticed so far is the lane departure auto correction and the cruise control/safety breaking."
"12  5, 2019",Great,Bought it on 11/26/19 it had hesitation and hunted for low gears . On 12/4/19 I went to dealer with 500 miles. They reprogrammed throttle with patch. Now drives great.. get the patch...
"12  4, 2019",Excellent SUV with all the options you will need,This vehicle handles extremely well with luxurious leather interior and all the most innovative technology available. Super nice entertainment package and weather package. The Pearl exterior color is very elegant.
"12  3, 2019",My first purchase vehicle,This car has a lot of leg room. You don’t feel the pot holes on the streets.It drive very smooth.I like that is an all wheel drive  vehicle.
"12  3, 2019",Great car,This car is great car for me and my husband love the car. We are super happy with car and the inside of car thank for help
"12  1, 2019",The absolute worst Toyota RAV 4,After buying a 2019 Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD  I regret the purchase the 2.5L engine is not matched to the new 8 speed transmission and when starting to accelerate the engine sounds like it is going to blow up until it gets going but the engine is loud and vehicle is slow not as good as my 2018. Be careful and do a long test drive as I did not do because I have owned so many RAV 4's
"12  1, 2019",Nicest car I’ve ever had,Love the size and style of this vehicle. Very smooth driving and quiet cabin. Love the driving feature and tech inside the car and feels very safe to drive.
"11 28, 2019",Great SUV,Great looking vehicle inside and out! Rides very smooth and is very comfortable. The interior design really caught my eye and love the moon roof! Very nice!
"11 28, 2019",Good looking car,"I think I made a good buy...good looking vehicle , inside and out.  Gives a smooth ride and  is easy  to handle especial for someone over 80"
"11 27, 2019",Love it!,"I purchased a Rav4 XLE Premium AWD. It feels like a luxury suv with its leather interior and extra features, such as seat warmers and CarPlay. It is sporty, comfortable, and reliable. I highly recommend it!"
"11 26, 2019",Malibu,This car fits all of our needs. We love the room the style the comfort. We love all the features it offers its gonna fit all of our needs for this vehicle.
"11 26, 2019",Love the car !,"We are pleased with the car.  We like the color and we like RAV 4 because we had one since 2007. Great car !  Runs well, and has just the right amount of room. We are learning about all the features !!! So fun !!
And great safety features !!"
"11 24, 2019",Such a great overall experience with Mike Berkoff!,"I love my new RAV4, it drives so smooth and the design is perfect. I had such a great experience with Mike Berkoff ! He made me feel so comfortable in the buying process and he was very knowledgeable. He also didn’t waste any time and was very efficient which made the process a lot better than i expected! Love earl Stewart Toyota and their facility!"
"11 20, 2019",I love it!,"This car is amazing! It drives smoothly, has so many great functions, heated wheel and seats and safety functions and alerts! I love everything about it!"
"11 20, 2019",Poor low tire pressure indicator,"No matter how much air is in the tires, can’t get this indicator to go away; ridiculous to be checking air pressure every time I need to drive lest I miss a “true negative”"
"11 20, 2019",Amazing toy!,"Got it brand new on Sumner.  Already 12k+ miles. Drove from Georgia to New York 6 times back and forward and from NY to Canada Niagara falls couple of times. PERFECT! No issues of any kind, no wird noises nor transmission and AWD problems. Amazing small SUV and beautiful design and the suspension is awesome off-road.  GET IT!"
"11 19, 2019",Most Comfortable Car I've owned,i traded in a 2014 honda crv lx - over the last 2 years my commute when from 40 miles to 100 miles a day & i was so uncomfortable in those base models seats - i was set to buy a crv touring but when toyota came out with this redesign i was in love!  i just recently had a 2 hour 15 minute commute & boy are these seats comfortable.  My main reason for getting a new car.  I got the limited model as i was looking for as much luxury as i could get in a mainstream vehicle.  I love that the dash is clean looking and not cluttered like many competitors in this class.  The RAV 4 is quiet on the highway (something my prior car wasn't).  I was pleasantly surprised by the pick up (i have the gas model) - i doubt i would beat out a Porsche but i certainly have enough speed for merging on to the highway and getting out the way in a hurry if needed.  i thought my prior car got bogged down on a slight incline have never felt like is was missing any power with this.  This may just be the vehicle that makes me a Toyota girl for life!
"11 19, 2019",Not vmi impressed,"I was not impressed with the new Rav 4, I drove a few small SUV s and I would recommend a CRV or Equinox over the new rav 4, the older rav 4 seems more solid vehicle"
"11 18, 2019",Best car I have had.,"is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology.
I really like the looks of this car."
"11 16, 2019",I like my Rav 4,"I wanted a reliable hybrid and Rav 4 fits the bill. It handles well, accelerates quickly, and I feel good not spending so much on gas."
"11 15, 2019","Only 100 miles on odometer, bought about month ago","I love my new RAV4. So far, GREAT!  Door storage pockets way too small, much smaller than my previous vehicle. Cup holder diameter should be a tad larger. Vehicles all have become extremely overpriced!!!"
"11 14, 2019","Comfortable ride, quality interior, noisy motor.","Very nice handling , comfortable ride and quality interior. Has great safety features. The con is it does not have Android Auto, a noisy motor and no GPS."
"11 12, 2019",Great great car...dont like engine with data use,shouldn't have to use my data for gps... other than that its great. gas tank lever is next to hood release and they look the same
"11 11, 2019",Great for winter driving and really comfortable fo,"I am extremely happy with the rav 4. Great comfort, and excellent gas mileage. It rides and handles well too. I would recommend Ira Toyota and get another car from ira."
"11 10, 2019",So far the best I’ve driven.,"There is still more to learn about this amazing selection I’ve made, so far I love its dependability and smoothness of the drive. The electronic connection and what not are just a tip on the iceberg for awesomeness."
"11 10, 2019",Biggest purchase mistake I ever made!!,"This CUV is  Junk.. I  rented a  2018 and 2019 for a week to test drive so I wouldnt make a purchase mistake .  I  did like the redesign 19 better but in my mind new the 18 mechanically would be better for commuting.  I  new and felt the transmission issue, engine noise and road noise , but still bought the 19 what a mistake.  Do not fall for the look  this thing is built so cheap it is to high tech for Toyota they need to stick to old school   they are riding on past reliability history. I  own a  2016 4runner and that is a real machine it is old school and proven reliability. Just looking at the pencil shocks and tinker toy structure makes me cringe.  This car is not worth the money I even bought the xle and the door switches don't even illuminate for 28,000 I  think not. It does have a nice ride but that's it. I  would recommend the 18 for proven reliability.  I  am trying to find a way to get rid of it without losing more money on trade in.  So if you love the looks and don't value your money go ahead  but the reliability is the 18..."
"11  9, 2019",Downsized vehicle,The vehicle is very fuel efficient. The ride is much more comfortable than our previous car. I like the overall size of the car and the appearance.
"11  9, 2019",Beautifuly designed,The drive is slightly bumpy and it does not pick up speed fast enough doe to the fact that it is 4 cylinder. I will recommend to friends and family
"11  9, 2019",Best car i owned,"This car met all my needs, Cheap. I love the interior and also the economy in gas. Comfortable to ride with my family and friends"
"11  8, 2019",Wife loves it,Very sharp looking car has all the bells and whistle’s I like the color we like all the safety options I would had a chance to experience the stereo yet but looking forward to it
"11  8, 2019",Great SUV 🚙,This vehicle exceeded our expectations for performance and features.  Multiple USB ports and power options.  The entertainment system was so easy to use and easily adapts Apple car play.
"11  7, 2019",Great on gas,I should of bought a car with third roll seat. It also needs more lighting to show in door for using lick unlock buttons and more cup holders in back. Great on gas .
"11  6, 2019",Love this Vehicle,"Turned in a 2016 to get a 2019. The safety features alone are amazing. You do have to get used to the Driver Assist but once I did, it's very easy on me on a long drive on an Interstate. The fuel economy is really good. I recently got 42 MPG on a 250 mile trip. Had to drive up a steep grassy hill, switched modes on the transfer case and it pulled right up the hill. As long as the new technology holds up I am a believer in this vehicle."
"11  6, 2019",Best car for my needs,Love it. Glad I made the purchase. Great car. Has all the bells and whistles that I wanted plus plenty of room for a very big dog.
"11  6, 2019",Dependable Car,"car play has been added, headlights fixed, poor Bluetooth phone calls are now history with the poor 2018 RAV4. so now you can see the sides as you turn. 2018 lacked these. I know because I bought a 2018 and regretted every bit"
"11  3, 2019",XLE AWD,"I do not agree with the reviews about performance. I have owned a V6 Mazda 6, a Jeep Wrangler, and a Chevy Malibu. Of course the acceleration on a 4-cyl SUV is going to be much different than a V6 car, or any car in general. If you wanna talk about bad acceleration get behind the wheel of any Jeep Wrangler made, I had my 2015 for 2 years and got rid of it without hesitation. I love my RAV4 and have had it about a month now."
"11  2, 2019",Car must for daily driving in the winter!,I love the car! Drivers and rides nice. Though I hope it had remote starter with the model I bought. Got a good price for it with the special financing.
"10 31, 2019",Quality Issued,"I have owned 3 Ravs, this is the worst. Transmission lurches, vibration on startup, remote startup, locks never worked paint coming off near roof guards and on door seam. Made in Japan, Limited AWD, 40K."
"10 31, 2019",RAV4 2019 Owner,"The RAV4 does deliver as it was advertised about. It’s my 1st week and I already am impressed the the MPG. I try staying on the ECO and been averaging 33MPG in the 3 days or 320 miles I driven. I love the safety options it came with it like the TSS 2.0, blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, LED head, tail and stop lights."
"10 31, 2019",2019 RAV4 is a great looking car and a great drive,The RAV4 is roomier than I thought...The new design has a great look...The interior design is also a great look... Great looking car and a great drive...
"10 30, 2019",First new car purchase in a long time,"Very nice car , second  RAV4 we have owned. Purchased from IRA Toyota in Danvers Ma.  No high pressure just provided all the info required to make an informed decision."
"10 29, 2019",FROM VENZA TO RAV4 LIMITED,"THIS CAR HAD FEATURES  WE DID NOT REALIZE WERE THERE AND AN ASSET TO SENIORS. REARVIEW MIRROR IS A WIDE VIEW BACK. KEEPS US STRIGHT IN A LANE. WARNINGS IF TO CLOSE TO SOMETHING, GPS, AND GOD FORBID IF EVER AN ACCIDENT AN EMERGENCY TAG WE PULL AND HELP IS SENT BASED ON LOCATION OF CAR. JUST AWESOME."
"10 29, 2019",All the good things I expected from a new Toyota,"My Limited blizzard pearl Rav4 looks great and performs very well. It is a gas model (not hybrid). And a feature that I love is that I am getting over 31MPG gas milage  average on my first  1500 miles!! Thanks, Toyota!
Early Riser, Mineral, VA"
"10 28, 2019","Beautiful car, great safety features.","Super handling capability, and great safety features.  Car has clean lines and offers plenty of room in the back seat area.  Great trunk space as well."
"10 26, 2019",RAV4 GREAT TO DRIVE,"THIS IS MY SECOND RAV4, I LOVE IT.  IT LOOKS GOOD IS VERY COMFORTABLE, HANDLES WELL IN RAIN AND SNOW. GREAT CAR FOR THE PRICE"
"10 25, 2019",Love All my Toyotas,This is a fun car to drive! It’s great on gas and the safety features are wonderful . I feel very safe driving my grandson. The interior is beautiful and comfortable. I love driving my Rav 4.
"10 24, 2019",It was just what I needed...,"I seem a wonderful in everything... Comfort, big, model, design it's perfect, I love this car and I will recommend to everyone buy one same"
"10 24, 2019",A really fun car to drive!,I love this car!!  Handles  like a dream.  I especially love the blind spot monitor.  Plenty of leg room in both the front and rear seats.
"10 22, 2019",I have never owned a used car before,This vehicle fits all of my needs. It has an amazing smart system and interior and exterior. I’ve never owned a new car before and I’m glad we ended up with this one! Couldn’t be happier
"10 21, 2019",This is my third Rav4,The Rav4 is fun to drive and will be even greater when I learned all of the new features. I am enjoying the learning experience. After the test drive I knew it was the car for me.
"10 20, 2019",Very good driving experience.,The ride is great to other suv’s tested.  Love the ride height compared to previous cars owned.  Still learning all nuances of new vehicle.  Body style is one of the best designs.
"10 19, 2019",Excellent vehicle,"SUV has great styling, drivetrain, nice safety features, & all the comforts I could want in a vehicle. Like that it had 2yrs free maintenance."
"10 16, 2019","Uncomfortable seats, Loud engine and road noise","Was told they insulate there cars better than Honda. Not true, vehicle has no insulation. It is very noisy. You can feel the vibration from the road on the passenger floor. The seats are stiff and uncomfortable.  Pickup is not that great."
"10 16, 2019",Horrible transmission,"I test drove this Toyota rav 4 2019 adventure edition and loved it. I was leasing car and decided to trade it in to own this one. Worst mistake! The engine noise is so loud when accelerating but very little power. I feel kind of embarrassed when going up the small grade hill to my house with people around because the car sounds like it is working so hard for such a little hill. Had to bring it in 3 times for clunking noises when decelerating around 18-23 mph. They replaced the transfer case, drive shaft etc. it is a little better but still sounds like parts are falling off but the dealership says it is normal. A hard jerking is felt as well when stopping briefly and then going without coming to a complete stop like if the light was red  when you pull up but then turns green shortly after. Very dangerous if not aware of this. Now the car is shaking when accelerating at times. Do not buy this car!"
"10 15, 2019",entire experience of purchasing RAV4-great,"Totally satisfactory, options, safety features, special packages, customer servicing, 24 hours rescue assistance, comfort, fair price, trade-in, warranty, style, automatic enhancing road safety, dynamic radar cruise control"
"10 15, 2019",I love my car!,"This car is perfect for my needs. Not only is it a huge upgrade from a car to an SUV, but it is the perfect size. There is plenty of room within the entire car. The back trunk is very roomy as well. I love that it has the touch screen radio, as well as CarPlay. The back up camera has fantastic quality and is very clear. I drive to and from class everyday, and this is also my family car. It is also great on gas!"
"10 11, 2019",Best car we owned so far,The new Rav4 is very nicely stylized with plenty of room and new features inside. Handles very nicely as well. Overall we are very happy with the purchase.
"10 10, 2019",Great car,Love the new Rav 4. Safety features are a plus. Seats are comfortable. Gas mileage is good.  Took it on a few trips so far and was very comfortable.
"10 10, 2019",Camary,"HYBRID. 
The car is great, however the gas tank will not fill all the way up. It shuts off at 3/4 about 9 gallons. 
Toyota knows about it but has not come up with a fix.
Don’t but it until they figure this out."
"10  9, 2019",DELIGHTED WITH MY CHOICE!,GREAT AMENITIES - LOVE THE BIG SCREEN ON DASH!  LOTS OF SAFETY FEATURES. PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE BACK SEATS PLUS LUGGAGE AREA. LOVE ALL FEATURES OF BLUE TOOTH.
"10  9, 2019",Smart Truck,"This car is what I need. It has apple car play ,dynamic  navigation and scout GPS link. It has full of safety  features front and back, side to side , the pre collision system with pedestrian detection, the lane departure alert, the lane tracing assist, the automatic big beam, the dynamic radar cruise control / full speed range, and the road sign assist."
"10  8, 2019",Very happy with my new Rav,"This Rav is roomier than my old one and I like the new features like auto high beams and driving assistance. Still getting used to the backup screen but its great. Not pleased with Entune app and read online is a common problem with the 2019 models not loading properly and displaying constant errors but will have that checked on my first service appointment. Everything else I'm happy with & I have received numerous compliments hiw ""pretty"" my new Rav is."
"10  8, 2019",Best car I've owned so far,This car meets all of my expectations.it has plenty legroom.Also my children liked the new car as well. The interior design was very nice. This car is great
"10  7, 2019",Excellent vehicle great on gas.,Love the RAV4 all around excellent mileage beautiful inside and out. Priced just right for my budget. Ado was a great salesman. I would buy
"10  7, 2019",Nice ride,Very nice car. Excellent rider. Very confortable. Cheaper in gas.  This vehicle is very good for off-road. I took this to the beach and everyone was stunned by how well it was preforming. I take it up to the mountains and there are no problems the AWD System works perfect.
"10  7, 2019",My 5 th Toyota Car,This is my 5 th Toyota car but downsized from the other 3 . I like the color and features especially the safety ones. It’s a bit high though.
"10  7, 2019",Very nice vehicle,Excellent vehicle. Excellent price. Drives very well!!!! Better features than our previously owned 2018 model. It is a very quiet driving vehicle and handles very smoothly!!!!
"10  5, 2019",Anxious go on a trip with this new car,"Excited about the correction in driving the car.  Only had the
car for 2 days, so I can't really give a review yet.  Loved the
car so far."
"10  5, 2019",Great SUV,This is one of the best cars I've ever own. Great ride great gas milage plenty of  pep when you need it.  Looks good too Apple CarPlay is great I couldn't be happier
"10  4, 2019",Best vehicle for the money,"I love everything about this vehicle and there isn’t anything I do not like about it. The color is sharp, interior is sleek, car looks sporty but functional for a family."
"10  3, 2019",This is a great car for the money.,"This car has a great tech package and is powered well for it's class.  The red pearl color is beautiful in the sun.   The tech package is very good. The driver's seat adjusts multiple ways but the passenger seat does not. Turned out to be hard for my wife to enter the vehicle.   She needs to sit and turn in, but she hit her head doing that.   Otherwise I was very happy with this vehicle!"
"10  2, 2019",Great car,Meets my needs. Ride is comfortable and handles easily. Enjoy driving the car and like the looks of it. Easy to get used to driving.
"10  2, 2019",Great Car!,This is our third Rav 4. I initially bought my daughter one a few years ago. I am impressed with the ease of driving and safety features.
"10  2, 2019",FUN CAR,"I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD OWN A VEHICLE WITH ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES AND THIS VEHICLE PROVIDES ALL THAT. IT'S LIKE A PLANE COCKPIT. I LOVE IT!  REAL NICE, COMFORTABLE RIDE.  ONLY THING I'M MISSING IS A LIGHT IN THE GLOVE BOX.  REASON I GAVE ONLY 4 STARS FOR THE INTERIOR DESIGN; I THINK THE HANDLES ON THE DOORS ARE SPACED TOO FAR FORWARD FOR EASY GRIPPING IF YOU'RE GOING AROUND A CORNER. YES, YOU HAVE THE CEILING HANDLES ALSO, BUT AGAIN, THEY ARE IN AN AWKWARD SPOT. 
THE MOVEMENT OF THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS TO THE DOOR WAS GENIUS.  YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT IT, BUT THAT EXTRA LITTLE BIT OF WINDOW HELPS."
"09 29, 2019",Good car,"Everybody have the issue about the transmission,  but there's nothing wrong about that. Solution take it to the dealer they have to update the computer system.  Mine is good now"
"09 28, 2019",Super nice vehicle with all the options.,"Many options with a great finish. Top notch leather and interior design. There are a lot of features from being able to remote start from phone , cooling seats to multi USB ports."
"09 26, 2019",First Toyota,"This was the third car I test drove. The wife and I agreed that it was the best of the three. It's stylish, roomy and really nice to drive. Plenty of room in the back for cargo."
"09 26, 2019","Great driving car, with great features.","A very stylish and safe SUV. Great safety features, and great gas mileage. And the Apple Carplay is awesome. Very good interior design. The 8 speed transmission is very good. And for a 4 cylinder, the car has good power."
"09 26, 2019",Loving my Rav4 2019,"This car has all the standard features that I would have to pay more for as I add on to another vehicle.  I couldn't ask for more.  Comfort, safety, amazing drive, quiet, great stereo, easy to use dash, room, sleek new line design.  It's perfect."
"09 26, 2019",Love my Rav4,The RAV4 is exactly what I wanted. Much better than the other choices I shopped.  More room and power very happy with my choice. Love my Rav!!
"09 25, 2019",It's okay.,I like that it's bigger than older models but it's not a smooth ride.  I preferred my 2015 Honda Crv over my brand new toyota and that's sad.
"09 25, 2019",Great car so far,This car checked all of the boxes for me.  Great value and very sporty looking.  Great game mileage.  Plenty of leg room front and back
"09 25, 2019",Time to trade in the family Van,"This car ticks almost all my boxes.Good value for the price, reliable and safe vehicle, that's just a Toyota. New up grades for the 2019, roomier. It's comfortable (except no arm rest and my short arms would really appreciate this) Back seat and cargo area are comfortable and spacious.
Love my new RAV."
"09 21, 2019",Hope the Honeymoon Doesn't End,We are so thrilled with our new car purchase. We haven't had it but a few days but we are pleased with our choice. Our 12 year old grandsons fit in the back seats and we love the safety features. The Drive Assist features are new to us. Love the rear view mirror camera!!
"09 18, 2019",I really enjoy this new car,This car is by far the best one i ever owned. I would highly recommend buy one. I will always buy toyota from now on.
"09 18, 2019",This is my second Toyota .,"I love it. And will always owe a Toyota.
The team at Milton Martin are outstanding. I like my RAV4 for the size, handling, gas mileage and looks."
"09 16, 2019",I love it! It’s a great car!,Mets my needs comfortable and I love the way it drives and rides perfectly! Would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Great car and experience
"09 15, 2019",Great car,"IT is a good car for the value,reliability and appearance.  I am happy with the features,especially the blind spot monitoring, Ecco feature to help save on gas, moonroof, and peppy engine.  I am excited to drive it this year."
"09 15, 2019",Loved it!!!!!!!,This car met all of our needs. Plenty of head and leg room. Easy to get in and out of. Drove like a dream. Love the beeping when you go over the line.
"09 15, 2019",Toyotas are the best!!!,"We just bought our new Rav4 on Friday, so we haven't driven it a lot yet.
What little we have driven it, we love. It is so comfortable with so much room. So many more computer parts than our old 2006 Sienna, that it may take a while for us ""older folks"" to get used to."
"09 15, 2019",Most reliable car I have ever owned,This car satisfied us very good. The outside looking is very modern and good for young man. All the functions are excellent.And it saves money.
"09 14, 2019",Update to prior review on 8 speed transmission,"We bought the 2019 model in Feb.  In the earlier review, I mentioned the 8 speed transmission was the worst ever and the only reason I would not recommend it.  Opened up a ticket with Toyota corporate, expressed my frustration and expected it fixed.  They contacted the dealer who then contacted me and said a fix had come out in August.
After the fix, the shifting problem is resolved.  It's still not a rocket but we knew that.  With the issue fixed, I recommend the vehicle."
"09 14, 2019",Frustrated and disappointed and angry,"Disappointed with 2019 Rav 4 Limited.  Disappointed in Toyota.  After having my Rav 4 for 5 months, approx 2,000-2,500 miles started  hearing GROANING type noise when car is upshifting and downshifting at low speeds going into 3rd gear or so.  Been to dealer, contacted Toyota. They will not do anything about it because they say there is no fix.  Also nothing mechanically wrong. But something is wrong. No brand new car should be making this groaning, grunting sound.  From what I read Toyota knew of this problem prior to release and released this vehicle anyway, not caring about how it will affect the consumer and customer satisfaction.  I feel Toyota does not care about quality anymore.  So disgusted and disappointed.  Shame on Toyota to continue to boast about their quality."
"09 13, 2019",Excellent SUV made in Japan.,"Best value for the money for a brand new, AWD, fully loaded SUV, Panoramic sunroof, 19” wheels and best of all made in Japan. Amazing trunk space and ample leg room in all seats."
"09 12, 2019",Perfect for an everyday driver,"This was my first brand new vehicle, and has exceeded my expectations. Every feature is easy and intuitive to use. This vehicle  is fun to drive, has every comfort you could need, and I couldn’t be happier with it!"
"09 12, 2019",The best,"This is the first time and I love it.the acceleration is good. I really like the looks of this car. It just stinks you have to go get one and the interiors is lovely,"
"09 12, 2019",Very satisfied with the vehicle overall,This car style has everything I need and want besides the hub caps that it came with. Except for the hub caps. We switched those out right away but everything else was perfect.
"09 12, 2019",No android auto,"Really like all the feature except it doesn't have android auto and only one USB port. I usually get hand me downs, but this car would not work for me."
"09 10, 2019",So far so good,"Well, I just purchased it because of the reputation of Toyota. I am expecting it to last a long time. So far we are extremely pleased with it"
"09  9, 2019",Have only had it a week. But I love it,Have not had it long but love it so far. Look forward to my first road trip. Commuting has been great!!  Love the backup camera.
"09  7, 2019",Entune Infotainment & Scout GPS are the worst !,Car engine noise is excessive. dash controls are not functional friendly and difficult and dangerous to use at night.  Far worse than my former RAV4 Hybrid and my 3 Prius's.
"09  6, 2019",Beware of the new 8 speed transmission,"We bought the vehicle in Feb 2019.  Have a little over 9k miles.
So far, no issues in terms of breakdowns.  Ride, mileage, safety features are very nice.

Biggest drawback is the transmission, especially in stop and go traffic.  When you get near a light and have to slow up for the other cars to start and you give it the gas at around 20 mph, the transmission hesitates to upshift.  Engine revs loud when it does.  

Toyota needs to fix this soonest as it's a major drawback.  My family has had Toyotas off and on since 1969 and this transmission is the worst ever, absolute worst.  Every Toyota vehicle prior had a better transmission.

I say I would not recommend for that one reason: the transmission."
"09  5, 2019",I have nothing but stars for Toyota products.,I last bought a Toyota Camry in 2005 and loved it all the tin me. Very few problems and wonderful support from Irwin's and Toyota. We previously owned Chevys and I would never buy another.
"09  4, 2019",Cadillac,It’s very nice and stuff like that you know what i mean like and the inside is very comfy and stuff you know like very comfy
"09  3, 2019",Lifelong Toyota Driver,"Have only had the vehicle a few days and am absolutely in love.  I’ve owned 7 Toyota’s and this is my second RAV4. The technology is more than I expected.  The safety features includes lane departure, blind spot monitor, traffic sign display, and of course the 5 star safety rating.  I was in a horrible traffic accident in a Camry and it saved my life.  Toyota’s are worth every penny you pay for them. I’ve never had an issue with any I’ve owned and would not drive anything else. This RAV4 is comfortable, roomy, the ride is quiet and smooth. I love the new design in the 2019. There is not one thing I don’t like about my new car."
"09  3, 2019",Great,Love the car!  smooth ride and good feel. Right size and comfort.  We drove a rental car like it and really fell in love with it.
"09  3, 2019",Annoying beep every time I brake,"Overall the car is great and meets most of my expectations. No matter how good the car is it can't compensate for a really annoying beep each and every time I brake. After visiting the dealer today I am informed this is normal as the brake relay has recently been repositioned inside the cab and cannot be rectified, much to the mechanics and my disbelief"
"09  1, 2019","A very comfortable, safe and good looking car","The Rav4 has been always one of my favorites I am very satisfied with it.
Definitely a real good purchase. Al Hendirckson Toyota made an effort to please me."
"08 31, 2019",Don't Buy if you like smooth driving,"If you are considering this car, test drive in an area where you can do a lot of breaking/accelerating. Highway driving is great. We made the mistake of only test driving on the high way and it is a little loud but otherwise drives well and has great gas mileage. Unfortunately, my daily commute requires a lot of stopping and starting for stop signs, red lights and traffic in general. This car is not smooth at all in that type of driving. It does not shift gears smoothly and when you stop and then go again, it seems to hesitate and then overcompensate making it very jerky to drive.  I took it for my 5000 mile maintenance today and they blamed eco mode and basically said its the price you pay for efficient gas mileage. And that just isn't good enough. They have to do better. This is a lease and my next car will not be a Toyota after this. I loved my 2016 Rav 4 which makes this extra disappointing. It is not the same car or even close. And the 2016 was way better in my experience."
"08 31, 2019",Very comfortable driving on highway feels stable s,Safe comfortable smooth ride like all the modern amenities  as I get older it’s nice to slide onto set of car as apposition to having scoot down into a car. Love the extra room in the back
"08 31, 2019",All the Toyotas I have owned are fantastic,The car more than meets all of my expectations.  All the extras that came with it are amazing.  It says I will average about 26-31 miles per gallon and already I have averaged OVEr 34 per gallon and that was not even highway driving.
"08 30, 2019",Amazing standard safety features and confortable,"More comfortable than my Solara and that’s saying something for the RAV4, and the standard safety features are better than y friend’s new Audi SUV!  It’s a tremendous value!"
"08 29, 2019",Most reliable car.,"This car met all my needs. The features and smart key are a nice touch. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology."
"08 26, 2019",Best SUV I have ever driven,This SUV is exactly what I was looking for fun relaxing comfortable spacious very safe and very reliable big and tall and all my family fits comfortable
"08 25, 2019",Great new design,"I have only owned it for a short time, but I am very happy with the comfort level and design. I have driven luxury cars for 20 years and this is a good option at a reasonable price"
"08 23, 2019",8 speed transmission is an epic fail,"like others here loved the test drive , didnt mind the engine noise
then at 1500 miles the hi pitch buzzing noise when it shifts thru lower gears ( 20 to 40 mph) is unbearable- i am getting nowhere with my
dealer on this issue"
"08 21, 2019",The Adventure model is sporty!,"This is a sporty version of a small SUV that offers enough towing capacity (3500# vs 1500#) for a true sport model.  Cool styling that looks a bit more masculine that standard ""soccer parent"" SUVs."
"08 19, 2019",Perfect SUV for Me,"I love the size and comfort of this SUV.  It has many extras.  The rear air is a plus,  lights  for the safety features is a must.  Thanks so much Toyota !!!!!"
"08 18, 2019",20 years owning/leasing Toyotas,"Have yet to reach 1000 miles, as expected, all is well,
based on prior experence  I expect no problems. Twenty
years being a Toyota customer."
"08 17, 2019",Overall vehicle seems fine.,Disappointed rav4 has no android auto.  I paid over 40k for the limited with no android auto and no awd that I really wanted.  Go figure.
"08 16, 2019",Best handle for a crossover.,The vehicle is great in handle and stability when pushed into the corners and out of the corners. Power is satisfying when you know you used to drive a underpowered car in the twisty mountain roads. Car can keep up with a mid class performance car.
"08 14, 2019",I love this car!,"This car is amazing! I absolutely love all the features, it handles amazingly on the mountains, we’re taking it on vacation! It drives so smooth and you don’t feel the car shift and you don’t even hear the motor, comfortable and drives wonderfully!"
"08 12, 2019",Worst Transmission ever,"This has to be the worst  transmission ever. The new 8 speed transmission jerks/hesitates at lower speed  when accelerating from  a  
 non complete stop. For example if you are breaking the car at a red light then light  changes  to green when the car still has not completely stopped , then accelerate quickly when the car is still moving forward and you will know whats wrong with it. I had other Toyotas and never seen anything close as bad as this. What happened to the transmission of the new Rav 4  Toyota?. This is worst than Chrysler transmissions.  This car transmission is horrible and needs to be recalled by Toyota(ASAP). Do not buy the new Rav 4 . Mine only has 5000 . I didnt notice this failure when test driving  the car but again this only happens under a very specific situation. If Toyota fixes this transmission issue the car is much better."
"08 12, 2019","Happy with our 2019 XLE AWD, Premium Package","We love our new RAV4, except for the navigation feature - it requires a smart phone to download the app and then to function. We are seniors who do not own one and do like the idea of the added monthly expense of owning and operating one just to have navigation on this vehicle; service rep advised that we might be looking at $100 per month. Will possibly think about another vehicle in 4 years."
"08 12, 2019",2019 Adventure Rav4,"This car made me feel unsafe, driving it on the freeway was overwhelming. To just drive it around town would have been fine. But I needed something that felt strong and a lot more power."
"08 11, 2019",Lemon with several known defects,"Our RAV4 is the awd adventure . The transfer case was replaced to cure clanking and grinding when shifting, second trip to replace the “magnetic actuater” one week later, the car now revs to redline on even moderate acceleration from a stop and transmission doesn’t know what gesr to go in. this car is unsafe. The ironic thing is, while the car is currently in the shop awaiting evaluation by a “district person., “ the dealer supplied a rental from enterprise... a Nissan Murano all wheel drive! (Which operates flawlessly. There are numerous service bulletins for both problems. and yet the service departments is scratching there heads and acting like the know nothing of the problem. After owning seven Toyotas, I may be looking st other brands to replace this RAV4!"
"08  7, 2019",Great improvement over previous model,"Very comfortable ride, lots of legroom. Little more roadnoise than expected, but not too bad.
It was easy to get a hitch mounted to carry my bike rack."
"08  5, 2019",This is my third RAV4,"This car has always met
My standards. Great gas mileage and comfortable. I love the new style of the rav4. It looks so much more sporty."
"08  3, 2019",Transmission - Adventure series,"I love everything about the car. I read the reviews about the transmission jerk. Toyota says there is nothing wrong. My car does it but only when I try to roll through a full stop. Solution? Don't roll through stops - it is illegal in all 50 states. So, as hard as it is, ignore that tailgater behind you and make a full stop!"
"08  2, 2019",Second Ugliest Car Ever Made,"This new RAV4 ranks second, in looks, only to the old Pontiac Aztec!  '19 Highlander is so sweet and the '19 RAV4 is hideous...what was Toyota thinking?  Wish I could give it zero stars for exterior styling!"
"07 31, 2019",Needs Refinement,"Its a handsome car, but needs refinement. I don't even mind that the engine is loud, but that 8 speed transmission needs a good breaking in (but still needs to be fixed by Toyota). I've put at least 3k miles on it and the  jerkiness has lessen, but still there. Complained to corporate about it and was given the response ""its a characteristic of the car"" - absolute rubbish imo."
"07 31, 2019",Decent car for the price,Not bad...still getting used to it.  Seems a bit louder and and jerky compared to my 2016 rav4 hybrid but the price was right on the base model so went for that.  2019 hybrids drive great but too expensive for a lease.  I leased so I’ll use it for 3 years then probably get another.  Drives decent...still getting used to the 8 speed...previous car was CVT.  It’s fine.  Not great but fine.
"07 30, 2019",Great Car!!,This is a great car.  This our 3rd Toyota and will not drive any other car! First one purchased in 1991 and it is still in service!!
"07 28, 2019",Love my new 2019 Rav4,"I loved the look of the new Rav4, so I took a test drive, loved it, now have it!
John Harke couldn't have made the buying process any easier.
Everyone at Village Toyota is so friendly and truly care about their customers.
When/if you need service ask for David Becwar - you won't be disappointed.
Looking for a new or used car? - ask for John Harke, he will make your shopping experience effortless."
"07 28, 2019",Love my new Rav4,"This car meets my current needs perfectly. Prior to the RAV4 I had a beautiful red 2017 4door Tacoma and truly loved it, I just missed having a 'trunk area'. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Village Toyota for your new car and the service is 2nd to none - ask for David Becwar.
You won't be disappointed."
"07 27, 2019",Súper uncomfortable seats,Very uncomfortable seats. Super hard seats. Advanced technology. Very expensive. Seats are too hard. Entune isn’t (have a cost). Don’t buy this vehicle. low roof
"07 26, 2019",Good value,So far I am impressed with the smoothness of the ride and the perfect size for my needs. It’s also easy to enter and exit for a shorter person.
"07 25, 2019",It's the most expensive car I bought!,"It's amazing , love the color (super white ) the glass texture , everything is awesome. Love it I can't  complain
Everything is exactly how I want it to be"
"07 25, 2019",Surprisingly quiet yet powerful new design.,We love it so far.  MPG is very good for SUV.  It was a big surprise.  Toyota redesigned and made it slick and enjoyable.  I am impressed.
"07 25, 2019",Bells & Whisles,Hard to figure out how to use all the stuff. Setup and changing setting hard to understand.  Saffty items good if you can figure out the settings.
"07 24, 2019",Nice Car!!,"This has been a great car so far. I’ve only had it a few months but after a week I drove to Arizona and back in it and had no problems.  I wish the backseat area was a little wider as I can’t fit 3 car seats in the backseat. I had to have my 8 year old granddaughter(she weights less than 50 pounds)not use her booster seat because the 4 year olds needed their car seats.   I also didn’t realize that the car didn’t have a CD Player. I saw on the screen “Track” and assumed it had a CD player(I’ve never had a fancy vehicle like this before), Oh Well!"
"07 24, 2019",2019 Rav4 LE AWD,"It was time for me to get a new vehicle, and I knew that I wanted a Rav4. They had what I needed and the service was great!"
"07 23, 2019",Transmission problem,"when slowing and then accelerating the transmission downshifts and when accelerating the car jumps and jerks . This could cause an accident if not aware of this problem. Toyota has to fix this, until than I would not recommend this car"
"07 22, 2019",I think this is the best investment I do 👌🏽,"I would liked get the Rav4 XLE but, I don’t regret about the LE. Great comfort, nice engine, soft on the road, i like it!"
"07 20, 2019",Cool car and drives smooth for a 4 cylinder.,The car is just the size and roomy. Car is safe and that is what made me want the car. It was a 5 Star safety rating.
"07 18, 2019",I love my new RAV4,"I traded my 2016 RAV for a new 2019 with more features I average around 30,000 miles a year. I like the stylish new body the all the new safety and technology Toyota has put into this vehicle and the 35 mpg is a plus"
"07 17, 2019",Beats the competitors hands down!,"Styling,  comfort, gas mileage, where do I start. Test drove most of the competitors.  By far the best. The handling  and the pick up is unbelievable. Love my Rav4!"
"07 17, 2019",The more safest car I’ve had,"I love my suv rav4 has everything I need. It is perfect for me, it has a lot of security and it is very comfortable and spacious for me."
"07 17, 2019",driver,car is good.I like it.I like this car. Good  service.good sells man car car car are good good good car good That all I think
"07 16, 2019",Bad Tech / Bad Transmission,"I bought a 2019 Rav4 in December of 2018.  The Bluetooth, keyless start, entune, and navigation system will not work.  All of the tech in the car is run from a cell phone through Bluetooth and the Bluetooth in the car does not link to mine or my wife's phone.  So basically the car has less tech than the 2006 Toyota we traded in for the car.  The car has been worked on 3 times with no success. Toyota has basically written us off as just another problem client who has already bought a car.  

Also the transmission is terrible with only 10,000 miles on the car the transmission locks up and sticks.  Also the car defaults to eco mode which makes the transmission problems even worse. 

The new body style and interior look better than the 2019 but over all the car is not a good buy.  I will not buy another Toyota."
"07 16, 2019",Love this SUV,"I love the remake of the 2019 RAV4.  Mine is the Limited so it is fully loaded.  It is comfortable. It has great seats and passenger room. The storage and cargo space is very adequate. I love its size for my purposes. It can easily haul my two cats and wiener dog! It drives nicely. It also responds well when needing extra speed. It handles well on curves and hills. I also like that good gas mileage. I would like to see the driver seat belt strap have more adjustments to avoid it rubbing my neck. Since I have had it only a very short while, I am still learning how it best meets my needs. But it is a very well-planned out SUV."
"07 16, 2019","Safest and ""Coolest"" Car I've Ever Had","This car had EVERYTHING I wanted plus more. Things I would not have thought of but now wouldn't think of having a car that did not have a camera displayed rearview mirror. Bird's eye view which displays even when driving very slow; for example, in a construction zone with narrow lanes. Instead of hoping you are not ""too"" close in tight areas, you actually KNOW.  I just love driving it. Love the way it looks. And such safety measures are just part of the standard package. Love it!"
"07 15, 2019",most pleasant purchase I ever had,"quiet ride, plenty of legroom, great gas mileage, comfortable.  I took it on a long ride and got 32. 6 mpg [as compared to my previous car which could not pass a gas station].  Salesperson was terrific: great knowledge of product, answered all questions, great"
"07 15, 2019",Love my Toyota Rav4,I like my new vehicle. It rides nice and quiet. I like the new design on the new Toyota Rav4's . It is very sleek looking.
"07 14, 2019",comfortable to drive feel secure in it,This car has the space we need  and comfort as well.   Having a 4 wheel drive vehicle  in Wisconsin that rides comfortably was what we wanted.
"07 12, 2019",Rav's are excellent vehicles-this is my 3rd one,"Excellent vehicle- has all the bells and whistles you could ask for in a vehicle!
I would highly recommend this vehicle to any one looking to purchase a new vehicle"
"07 12, 2019",Great car,"This car met all our needs and is very affordable, reliable and spacious. The features it has are great and I like the apps offered with the vehicle."
"07 12, 2019",Most Beautiful Car in the Quad Cities,"I can't say enough about this car.  It has everything !!
More than the 2018 I had for 1 year.  I love this car.  Computers scare me a bit but I was assured that Caleb has the power to ""make me happy""."
"07  9, 2019","Best SUV I have ever Owned.  So Comfortable, Safe.","This car gets great mileage, it's comfortable and roomy.  I can see now better behind all the Big SUVs and I am so happy with it."
"07  9, 2019",Best SUV I have ever owned!!!,This car is sharp looking. I didn't want a soccer mom looking vehicle. I am a Realtor ®️ and I need a nice and reliable roomie SUV that can go anywhere in Lake Ozarks. This vehicle does all of that!
"07  8, 2019",So far so good!,"So far I love my RAV4. It drives and handles great. Looks great and am enjoying all the new safety,  communication, and entertainment features. The new body style looks so much better than the previous one.  It's a lot of car for the money."
"07  7, 2019",30 Plus Years as a Toyota Owner!,It wasn't a very difficult decision to purchase our RAV4: we've been Toyota owners for 33 years.  We weren't disappointed by our most recent choice.  The ride is excellent for a small SUV.  That's largely a result of it's 109 Inch Wheel Base.  Fuel economy is outstanding and handling is pretty good too.  A heads-up.  The lane assist takes some getting used to and probably shouldn't be used on roads with a lot of curves/turns.  You'll feel like you're fighting the steering wheel but eventually you'll get used to the handling and be glad it's there.
"07  7, 2019",Beautiful color,"This car is diferent to the others is big like a SUV but you can drive like compact easy and securel, it istaller than the older model and this is a a good poimt"
"07  7, 2019",The all new 2019 Rav4 is amazing,"This thing has been redesigned and redefined, all new chassis, body,suspension, interior, it's a beautiful piece of art that drives and handles like a dream great on gas mileage, comfortable to take on long trips rugged enough to do some off roading also"
"07  6, 2019",Thank you Jeff Krivickas for my 2019 Rav4 XLE.,"This SUV has everything I wanted.  Heated seats, GPS, sunroof, backup cameras, bluetooth, etc. and the ride is so smooth.   Just love it.  My previous Rav4 lasted for 13 years, so I am hoping this one lasts just as long."
"07  5, 2019",An excellent car for the money,"Styling is a vast improvement over the previous model, the seats are comfortable even for my 6' 4"" self, the handling is good and the fact that the safety features are standard is very helpful.  The info center is actually at eye level which is excellent for not having to crane my neck down to see it.  Handling once at speed is excellent.  The two things I have to ding it for are engine roar, which seems louder than it should be for a 2.5 liter four-banger; and the acceleration from zero which feels like the engine is always struggling to get up to speed.  Other than that, I am a techie and I love the amount of options and controls I have in the dash and the driving experience is quite pleasant."
"07  4, 2019",Piece of S.,"Problem! After you own it. From getting into the car and I'm only 5ft, to driving around, speeds up take sometimes. AC setting poor. Point of view poorly. For a SUV it's more like a sedan."
"07  3, 2019",Worst transmission,The car lurches when starting and stopping.  It's like a manual when the gas and clutch are not in sync.  It looks good and I love the electronic seat.
"07  1, 2019",My first new car,"My new rav4 its beautiful, has insisted al features that I need, sunroof,  GPS, a lot of leg space, nice sound,  its cheap on gas, for out side look amazing"
"06 30, 2019",Rav 4 Hybrid is better than the gas version,"Test drove the gas and hybrid Rav 4 2019 and there is no comparison. The gas version is noisy and the 8 speed transmission is rough when it shifts. 

 We purchased the hybrid and never looked back."
"06 29, 2019",Great car,"High like an Acura. 
Rav4 car drives amazing but the price is better!  I'm so in love with my RAV4 2019.  This is the second RAV4 that I had."
"06 29, 2019",Rav 4,"Really like the Rav 4 BUT ALL manufacturers, (not just Toyota) need to get rid of the start/stop system!!!! Most of the complaints I see is due to the transmission being sluggish, jerky, etc. Its not the transmission, ITS THE CRAPPY START/STOP SYSTEM! If that system stays on new cars I will buy an old car next time."
"06 28, 2019",Most reliable!,I looooove this vehicle! My only concern is the camera. It is a little funny with parking as if I am parked on the curb.
"06 27, 2019",It is very nice car. I love it,This car is updated and latest. Its features are great. It meets my need and feel very happy with it. I love to recommend my friends and relatives to deal this car. The customer service is awesome.
"06 25, 2019",A beautiful SUV,Roomy interior.  Wonderful safety features.  Beautiful exterior.  Very smooth ride.  A joy to drive. It has met and surpassed all of my needs.  Strongly suggest you consider the Rav4.
"06 25, 2019",What up with the jerking?!,"I love my new RAV4 with the exception that from time to time when accelerating it will jerk, and I mean jerks hard... I’m thinking I will take it to the dealership as I’ve only had it for a month. I love the MPG and the new rugged look as well as the technology, If Toyota will fix the transmission issue I wouldn’t have any complaints whatsoever. Toyota fix the transmission issue."
"06 24, 2019",Nice Redesign but needs Refinement,"I was excited when Toyota redesigned the RAV4. I've owned Toyota's in the past and liked how they made it look less ""Soccer Mom"". I have to agree with the majority of reviews I've seen on Youtube about how it is a good step forward, but it needs work.

First of all, the engine sounds awful. When you want to accelerate to higher speeds, the engine does make a terrible, high pitched buzzing noise which is normal of all things! It really is quite grating, almost as bad as nails on a chalkboard.

Acceleration is also jerky, you start off slow, the buzzy engine kicks in and then you're pushed back in your seat.

The steering is strange. It is easy to steer, but you get absolutely no feedback from the steering wheel. If you weren't looking at where you want to go, you'd never be able to tell the steering wheel was doing anything.

It's not all bad. The new styling is great, plenty of cargo room, rear leg room is good and the interior is nicely done and feels like quality.

Hopefully Toyota will do something about the horrendous engine noise and jerky acceleration in then next couple of years; these are its biggest drawbacks."
"06 21, 2019",transmission,when slowing and then accelerating the transmission downshifts and when accelerating the car jumps and jerks .  Needs another transmission? This could cause an accident if not aware of this problem.
"06 21, 2019",I just start to drive a new one. We will see.,"Like it so far. Comfortable seats , climate control, rear view camera, blind spots detection, electronic seat adjustment, and lots more which needed more time to learn."
"06 21, 2019",The best car I have owned.,This car is exactly what I had hoped for. Still learning a lot about all the great features it is equipped. It is a great vehicle and I will derive years of pleasure with it.
"06 21, 2019",The transmission is a mess,"Have mine since December 2018, constant transmission issues, launch forward, shift shock, slipping, hesitation you name it, the transmission has done it. Door panels, center console, seatbelt holder, mirrors, trunk all rattle like crazy. Engine extremely noisy on acceleration, wind and road noise are 78db measured on the highway. The side mirror vibrate a lot on the road causing you to no see properly. Almost had a crash since the transmission hesitated for 3 seconds and I lost speed and almost got rear ended. Reported to Toyota Canada and was told their product is fine, I simply need to drive safer and they suggested I read the owners manual to learn how to operate their product. Dealer can't do anything since Toyota won't do anything about it. Honestly, buy something else, this new generation are lemons. Look on forums for more detailed information."
"06 20, 2019",Downsizing from a Sequoia,"I love the look of the 19 RAV4, it’s beefier and more sporty then the 18. It also is more powerful and I love driving it so much that I made my daughter buy one. I’m averaging 32.9 mpg and after driving a Sequoia for years I’m pretty happy with it."
"06 19, 2019",Don't buy the 2019 Rav 4 Adventure,"This was my very first brand new car and it is possibly the worst financial mistake I have ever made. I should have stuck with my trusty 16 year old Acura that never gave me problems.  I've always owned Acura's so moving to Toyota i thought ""hey, Toyota is known for reliable cars and that is what i need.""  Well, they fooled me! i Bought the Adventure model bc it was my favorite.  I drive 100 miles a day and in 4 1/2 months i have racked up 9000+ miles on this rig.  Things you don't realize until you drive this car a lot - this car is LOUD, the engine when accelerating is loud, the road noise is loud, there are all sorts of rattling noises in my car...I feel like Toyota duped us with this new Rav 4.  Fast forward and now my car makes grinding noises when accelerating (transfer case issue), dealer said Toyota just came out with something and they will fix it, however, I am betting it doesn't fix it.  The only positives about this car is i get pretty awesome gas mileage because of my daily commute, if i drove this thing in town stop & go, i would guess my gas mileage would suck.  I went back and forth between toyota, honda, and subaru....I wish i would have stuck with the Honda family or tried out a subaru.  Toyota you disappointed me royally - i wish I had only leased this car so i could give it back :("
"06 17, 2019",Love my Rav,"I have such a crush on my car. This is my 3rd Rav4.  Not only do I feel safe in my vehicle, I know it's reliable and sooo good lookin.  You can never go wrong with a Toyota!!!"
"06 14, 2019",Beware! Rav 4 2019 has major problems!!,Purchased 2019 Adventure Rav 4 and after 1000 miles started heading grumbling moaning noise. At stop signs the car would lurch forward when accelerator applied. On freeway the noise from drivers window is distracting and radio needs to be turned up louder. On a hill the car decided to break itself! Many issues..and the kicker is that Toyota does not know how to fix the problems!!! Do not purchase this vehicle until a recall is made and they address these issues. I am without my new vehicle and just on hold until who knows when. Really rotten experience so far.
"06  9, 2019",Super please with my new RAV4!,"I recently purchased a new 2019 Toyota RAV4 XLE Premium. I love this car! It rides super smooth, looks sleek and is made with quality. The price point is right on. A family member purchased their RAV4 about a year ago and loved it so much she recommended I look at the same vehicle when I was in the market for a new car. I’m so glad I did!"
"06  6, 2019",Most Reliable Car and Fun car to Own,"Love all the amenities, from the Moonroof, dual climate control, power adjustable driver seat to all the Safety features!! I cant wait to take long road trips with this vehicle!!!"
"06  5, 2019",Nicest New SUV,It met all my needs. Plenty of room. Get lots of leg room front and back. Love all the safety features. Very satisfied with my purchase.
"06  5, 2019",Excelente vehiculo,Excelente comodo economico y sobre todo un vehiculo para toda persona interiors comodos elegantes y doble unidad de aire donde tu acompañante puede graduar su calefaccion muy buena
"06  5, 2019",Super nice car!,"Great car to fit all of our families needs! So much room, very comfortable,  drives like a dream. Love,  love,  love my new car! Would highly recommend!"
"06  3, 2019","Excellent performance, feeling safe and secure!!!","Very comfortable, handles extremely well...most importantly we feel safe and secure!  It meets all our needs, perfectly.  Also, we LOVE the hardlines--it doesn't look like every other vehicle, on the road today."
"06  2, 2019",Toyotas are the most reliable car!,Love it except not having a remote start. I've owned toyotas since the 70's. Wish it would have come with a remote start. They are very convenient for an older person
"06  1, 2019",CUTE AND VERY FUCTIONAL FOR MY NEEDS,LOVE THIS SUV CROSSOVER THE MEN IN MY LIFE ARE OVER 6' TALL AND THEY HAVE THE LEG AND HEAD ROOM THEY NEED TO RIDE COMFORTABLY EVERYDAY
"05 30, 2019",not all the controls in the car light up at night.,"The engine lurches forward for a slow or stop will jerk your head off. I will purchase one again! The engine runs good and the car handles very good once your driving it. Also, the controls on the vehicle audio system are to complicated to operate. You have to use your cell phone to operate the GPS. Not good idea Toyota."
"05 29, 2019",Great vehicle but does have a quirk,"Well built and comfortable. Does have one issue...it tends to lurch forward. This happens when almost coming to a stop and then accelerating as you might find in moderate to heavy traffic. It is almost as if the motor stopped then kicked back on which causes the lurch forward. In this vehicle there is no pause for the motor as some are designed to do as in hybrids, therefore a quirk."
"05 28, 2019",A great car if you never need an in-car GPS,"Just bought a 2019 RAV4 Hybrid XLE. This is our 4th Toyota Hybrid. Started out with a 2007 Camry that would still be on the road if someone hadn’t wreaked it. Replaced 2007 with a 2015 Camry and then added a 2017 RAV4. I mention our hybrid history so I can testify that in all the years and miles that we’ve owned a Toyota hybrid, we have NEVER had to repair or fix ANYTHING. Oil, gas and two sets of new tires and THAT’S IT.

We replaced the 2015 Camry because we fell in love with all the safety equipment that came on our 2016 RAV4. Two trips to Texas in the Camry and two trips to Texas in the RAV4 proved that all that safety equipment is not only addictive but affective.

First impression of the 2019 RAV4 Hybrid: we love it. It’s easier to get in and out of than my 2015 Camry and it has all that Safety Sense equipment. It rides as smooth as the Camry, is just as quiet on the road, it rides higher so the view of traffic is better and it gets the same gas milage as my Camry and much better gas milage the our 2016 RAV4. Wish it had a bigger gas tank, as it doesn’t have the same range as the Camry.

Now for the tail of woe. The NAV system and Entune 3.0  is absolutely AWFULL.

If you don’t own a Smart Phone, you are doomed. If you own an iPhone you are only semi-doomed. With an iPhone you have the option of using Apple CarPlay. Without an Apple iPhone you are stuck with Toyota’s Scout GPS Nav System.

First, you must download Entune 3.0 AND Scout GPS Link on your phone. To use the Entune Apps you can connect your Smartphone to the car directly (plug it in the the USB data port) or via Bluetooth. If you want to see a “moving map” on the car’s display you MUST plug your phone into the USB data port, otherwise you can only get turn-by-turn instructions from Scout GPS. Not sure anyone in their right mind uses Scout GPS except as a last desperate resort.

If you have an Apple iPhone you have the option of using Apple CarPlay and whatever GPS Apps you have on your phone, BUT, you MUST plug your iPhone into the USB data port. When you are using Apple CarPlay, you CANNOT use any of the Entune 3.0 Apps or listen to an iPod.

Fortunately I own an iPhone but I don’t like plugging and unplugging my iPhone every time I use my car just to use Apple CarPlay. It’s like putting your phone on and off a charger which is bad for your phone battery. Also, if you are connecting your phone to the USB data port, the option of the wireless charger becomes moot. We really, really like the SIM card based GPS in our older Toyotas as it provided a constant moving map we could monitor on the car’s display but we will have to get used to not having that feature anymore.

The car is great but it looks like we will only use the NAV system when we absolutely need to or the passenger will just have to go old school and be a navigator with a road atlas."
"05 28, 2019",A letdown,"Not as spacious as my old 2009 RAV4. I love the new exterior style of the Adventure trim that I bought. Great safety features and mpg. But...horrbile transmission with plenty of metal in metal noises, weird shifting (more so while downshifting) as it ""pulls"" and slips at low speeds. Traction control warning light keeps coming on and the dealership can't find why. Grinding noise when accelersting on the highway. Trying to love it but is difficult. I wish I could return it already and I have only driven it for just four months."
"05 27, 2019",My new RAV4,Needed a new vehicle and was looking at an Explorer or a Honda.  The RAV4 met all my expectations.  Plenty of room and hauling capacity.
"05 26, 2019",I'm not going to buy from Toyota anymore,"If I could give this review simply less than one star, then I would ultimately make that decision. For such a high price with 2019 RAD4 Pre, compared to other vehicles of this price range, the navigation systems that are included within the vehicle is absolutely unacceptable. Toyota should immediately update the navigation systems to accomodate for our needs. It is confusing and inefficient for us to have two application systems open (Scout GPS and Entune) in order for the system to function. It's unsafe to operate vehicle while manage this system apps"
"05 25, 2019",Love it,This car is exactly what I wanted and needed. It’s reliable and spacious enough for my family. I’m very happy and excited to finally own it and have been showing it off to all my family and friends.
"05 24, 2019",Impressed with design,"Just purchased the car, but love the ride and design.  Lots of room for car seat, and cargo.  Very comfortable seats, rear vents for heat and air, and many tech features."
"05 22, 2019",Lives up to expectation,"I traded an Avalon for the RAV 4 and wasn't sure what to expect in comfort and performance. Very satisfied with both. The only drawback so far is the small information center that shows speed, etc. The external temperature number is difficult to read and I cannot find how to brighten that screen. Otherwise, I really like driving it."
"05 21, 2019",It is comfortable and reliable.,"This car exceeds all my expectations. It is comfortable, fast and has all the technology and features that anyone needs. I will recommend to anyone to try this beauty out. I love it."
"05 20, 2019",We only buy Toyota!,Toyota is the best car/ trucks by far we only buy Toyota so happy with the new rav 4 xle 2019 baby woo hoo !
"05 19, 2019",It is so comfortable and easy to drive,"This car is so easy to drive and it is so comfortable to ride in, we love all the bells and whistles it comes with."
"05 17, 2019",First time buyer of a new car,"I am ecstatic about my new car. I love sitting higher off the ground, I feel safe commuting with my daughter, and the whole look and feel of the car is everything I could have dreamed. Beyond satisfied with my purchase."
"05 15, 2019",Fantastic Upgrade for the RAV4,"The seats and ride are very comfortable on both short and long distance trips. Handles the wind very well. The gas mileage is great, averaging 30 mpg all round driving. The vehicle has nearly as much room as the Highlander for less money."
"05 14, 2019",Disappointing,I was so excited about the 2019 RAV4 and am now so thankful that I leased instead of purchasing.  The 8 speed transmission accelerates horribly.  So disappointing!
"05 14, 2019",RAV4 Limited,This car has great legroom up front and the back is not as roomy but it rides comfortable.  When you drive this vehicle the RAV4 Limited it’s very comfortable it really hugs the road. I like when I accelerate from a stop  the vehicle has great power.
"05 13, 2019",Great car. Terrible Entune/map system.,"We bought the hybrid for its gas milage, comfort, safety features, and ease of entry/exit.  It comes with no build in GPS screen/map--to have one requires plugging in the GPS/maps from one's iPhone. No excuse to have such an excellent car paired with such a crap GPS/map/Entune product."
"05 12, 2019",Great car,"Very nice design with apple CarPlay really like it my favourite very smooth ride great on gas plus a lot of safety features always my all wheel
Drive car love it"
"05 11, 2019",Love the style and the ride!,"I only have 2 complaints.  The seat is too high on passenger side and no adjustments.  If you don’t duck in you will hit your head.  Also I miss the CD player.  Other than this we love the Rav4.  Roomy, comfortable, good gas mileage.  Plenty of storage areas."
"05 11, 2019",Second RAV4,"This vehicle is a ""sharp looker"", is a fuel sipper, and satisfies our vehicle requirements to a ""T"".

My first RAV4 was trouble free for 10 years of ownership, so I suspect this one also will fit in that category."
"05 11, 2019",Great purchasing experience,"So far, so good. A little early to say how the vehicle will turn out but it certainly has been all that I was looking for in a new car."
"05 10, 2019",Worse Toyota Crossover I ever had in my life,"The car has a beautiful look, and very spacious.; but the rest is garbage. Noisy engine, very bad on gas . I bought the limited version back in February 2019, extremely disappointing with my purchase. I have taken it to the dealership more than 10 times because of the transfer case problem. Toyota has replaced mentioned part ; but the noises still exist big time, very annoying type whopping sound . Still no remedy.  Guys if you want buy stress then buy RAV4 2019 !"
"05 10, 2019",First Time SUV Owner,"This vehicle seemed like it would be an easy transition form a sedan.  I love the height, the larger view from the mirrors and windows.  All of the safety features are incredible."
"05  9, 2019",Perfect4Me...Only one flaw I've found so far,"The only thing I have to make note about is the ""out of the gate"" power on acceleration. It thinks about it for a split second. Being a Lead foot stomp and go girl, I make note of that. But once on the road the smoothness will let the speed get away from you VERY quickly. So really 4.995 /5 stars."
"05  9, 2019",Wonderful car,This car has all the bells and whistles for a great price. The salesman was so helpful and not pushy at all! This is the third Toyota we have purchased !
"05  9, 2019","Great size, versatile, comfortable, bold look","Bold design,, very technically advanced.
I love the redesign. This is my second Rav-4 , very reliable SUV.
It is the perfect size  for my wife and I."
"05  7, 2019",It’s only 1 week old,"A great car so far....Lots of technology, which I am becoming more comfortable with...

I’m 65, so it’s taking a few days....I’m extremely pleased....I’d recommend this vehicle to anyone"
"05  7, 2019",Best car ever,This car met all of my needs.. I have never owned a new car before so this is my first brand new vehicle.  The features on this car are great. I am very happy!
"05  6, 2019",Transmission should be recall and fixed.,"Needs chrome grille, molding, bumpers, etc. Like technology and handling. And overall looks ,Engine runs a little rough .Wish back of vehicle looked  more sporty"
"05  6, 2019",Safest Vehicle I’ve Ever Owned,"If someone or a vehicle passes behind you when backing up, it stops you immediately. Now that’s what I really like. By the way, it’ll do the same when someone or a vehicle passes in front."
"05  6, 2019",Great RAV4,Love my new RAV4 from LaGrange Toyota!  Drives well and has great pick up speed.  Plan to keep this for a long time and I know I will get great service from Toyota!
"05  5, 2019",The best purchase I ever made!!!,This car is AMAZING!!! The best RAV4 I've ever driven. It really feels like I'm driving a truck. I am beyond satisfied with this purchase.
"05  2, 2019",Great car - not equipped for roof racks...,"Anyone noticed that the 2019 models don't currently have an option for cross bars (Toyota or other market).  Also Toyota hitch not available, so must go with after market.  Bought the car in Dec 2019, and am told I won't be able to carry a bike or a canoe or cargo box until the cross bars are available in Fall 2019 - this is possibly a full year that I can't use the car as I'd hoped!  Flush rails were a surprise to the dealer as well as us, as we'd bought the car unseen...feeling like compensation should be in order for those that purchased early.  It's been a real inconvenience, not to mention the need to purchase specific new items rather than the type of cross bars that fit raised open rails."
"05  2, 2019",Love RAV 4 Adventure!!,"Love the new design, color, trim!! Great vehicle! Toyota has taken this new design above and beyond! Goes great in snow and very comfy ride."
"04 30, 2019",Lots of features...nice car,I was looking a few features but it gave me a lot more. Exceeded my expectations. It seems to be made for safety. So far I'm completely satisfied
"04 29, 2019",Very reliable SUV and very comfortable,"This car has a lot of features that I would like to drive it, the most I like it is the huge screen that I can connect my IPhone"
"04 29, 2019",Had Camrys for 25 yrs. love my RAV4,"The safety features are awesome, love the new shape of the RAV4. The large backup camera is much clearer then the Camry had. The only thing I miss is having a CD player!"
"04 28, 2019",Most reliable car that I have owned,This car more than meets all of my needs. I has all the features that I was looking for.  Its ride is very quiet and smooth. The radio has a great sound. The gas economy is very impressive.
"04 27, 2019",I love this car!,"I didn't even consider the RAV4 when I was looking for midsize crossover vehicles. However,  in my research I came across the Rav and saw the redesign. I HAD to see it in person! I saw it,  drove it,  LOVED it. It is so comfortable! I love all the features that my RAV has. I feel like I got a great car for a fair price."
"04 24, 2019",Toyota Rav4,"Is one of the best car I drive , and how good it is when you driving it and how contable is, I love it"
"04 24, 2019",Stylish RAV,"This car meets my needs as a grandmother and running around town. The stitching on the leather seats is beautiful. The seats are very comfortable, love  the cordless phone charger, and has a smooth ride. I knew going in the engine is not as quiet as other choices but overall has been a great choice for me."
"04 23, 2019","Thanks to David, Jason, Paula in Devils Lake, ND",This is our first time owning a Rav4- All i can say is we LOVE IT!! Our experience at Lake Toyota is always GREAT!!!   We have a Tundra pk.up & Lake Toyota  always treats customers  GREAT!!!!
"04 22, 2019",Awesome drive and very comfortable,Love it! Drives like a dream and gets great mpg. Feels very safe also. Really surprising all the features and i am still finding more thinhs that this Rav 4 does!
"04 22, 2019",Best car ever,"Today is my first full day, so far it’s wonderful except for “entune “ got stuck and didn’t operate during a long trip. The performance is impressive."
"04 21, 2019",Car with most options,I love this car.  It has a couple of things I wished my previous car had.  The parking assist is great and so it the Car Play that syncs with my iPhone.  Gas mileage is also better and the ride is good.
"04 20, 2019",Rave for Rav Update,"After nearly five months of owning my 2019 XLE RAV4 I have to say I am still pleased with my purchase.  This is an update from my previous review and I can now say I am very happy with the gas mileage of 31 in town and 36 on the highway. For an AWD that is awesome especially during a Wisconsin winter.  As for safety I can say the windshield is extremely strong. I had a huge five inch thick chunk of ice that flew off the roof of a Jeep two cars in front of me hit me straight on as I was driving 70 miles per hour.  We had an ice storm two days before so yes it was all ice and not just snow. Don’t know how I didn’t lose control but I was able to stay in my lane and continue on without a crack or even a chip in the windshield. I thought for sure my windshield would at least be chipped from the impact. As for the people who complain about the eight speed engine shifting roughly from a complete stop or rolling stop,I have learned that it will shift smoothly as long as I’m not trying to be a race car driver. Just remind yourself this is only a four cylinder.  Overall I am still happy with my Rav."
"04 17, 2019",What happened Toyota?,"I'm a Toyota guy who is really disappointed.  The new design is fantastic but the drivetrain is really LOUD, obnoxious and strange/difficult to drive.  In fact, I wanted so badly to like this vehicle that I went back and test drove it 3 times.  But, I just couldn't tolerate a motor that made such a racket during acceleration.  Sounds and acts like a cheap 4 cyl American car from the 90's.  Toyota you really let me down and I bought another brand this time."
"04 16, 2019",COOLEST LOOKING CAR EVER!!!,"THIS CAR IS MY VEHICULAR VERSION OF A SOULMATE,PERFECT IN EVERY WAY GAS MILEAGE IS PHENOMINAL RIDE IS SMOOTH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS CAR IS BEAUTIFUL"
"04 15, 2019",Problems from the start,"Overall, I like the car. It is attractive and rides fairly well for an SUV though it can be a bit clunky when accelerating. What I don't like is that the car is over-engineered and has to communicate with Toyota constantly. The communication module in mine is malfunctioning requiring a major repair to fix. Not happy with that part"
"04 15, 2019",Rides very smooth and love all the electronic feat,"This car is very roomy, plenty of leg room and drives great. Oscar set up all the automatic electronic features. I absolutely love this vehicle."
"04 14, 2019",Ready to buy after test drive.,"Spent a couple hours with an Adventure trim today.  I can’t speak for the other trims, but I feel like the over all fit and features, on top of expected reliability make this a good deal.  At around $33k+ for the Adventure trim, it is on the slightly pricey side, but the standard safety features and torque vectoring AWD, on top of the sporty, tough and functional interior design are worth it.  If I can convince my wife and get a good deal with the local dealer, we will be in one of these as soon as possible."
"04 12, 2019","Safety, Reliability, and Luxury at a Fair Price","I have bought 4 Toyota cars (Tercel, Corolla, and Camry) and finally decided to join the cross-over/SUV bandwagon.  My new RAV4 is futuristically yet handsomely stylish. The XLE premium trim provides the pampering convenient features such as automatic hatch, driver seat, blind spot monitoring, rear camera, dynamic cruise control and Toyota Safety Sense 2.0.  It’s like driving a Lexus RX 350 but paying $25,000 less."
"04 11, 2019",Toyota is the best of the car in the World,"Great car 
I Feel very blessed by the Lord Jesus to have it, because it very spacious easy to drive it is unbelievable the Gorgeous is my beautiful amazing Toyota Rav4.  I thanks God first then I thanks God for all off you guys. May God bless."
"04 11, 2019",2019 RAV4 Limited FWD,"After waiting so long for this new model, I’m sorry to be so disappointed. 
The transmission (8 speed automatic) is terrible. It can’t decide what gear it wants to be in at slower speeds and clunks so loudly, you think something may be falling off. Apple play also didn’t work properly for the 5 weeks I owned this vehicle. After the second time in for service that lasted 3 days in the service department at the dealership, both problems still existed."
"04  9, 2019",Already having problems,"Disappointed
Cruise control locks up steering wheel
Bluetooth issues
Brakes squeal loud
Small cargo space

Toyota agrees that there is a safety problem with the vehicle"
"04  9, 2019",My first SUV purchase,"This car has everything I was looking for XLE package has well worth it additions. Plenty of headroom , leg room and cargo space. Rear seats had adjustable tilt which makes for a cozy ride. I had previously read reviews prior to purchase where people complained of loud engine noise in the cabin, I don’t particularly notice anything more than my previous corolla had. Interior is streamline and overall basic but the heated seats and enfotainment system are perfect. The fuel mileage is excellent, it’s the same I was getting in my Toyota Corolla currently average 27Mpg in the city."
"04  9, 2019",have owned six toyota over the pass 13 years.,"very easy to handel..drive very good..put togeather very good..workmanship is outstanding..cant go back to any other make..
had sever toyota since 2006 that tell youy anything.."
"04  8, 2019",I'm actually shocked,First and foremost I actually love the SUV! I didnt think I would maybe more of a like. I wanted a Jeep but who knew the Rav4 is everything I need. Even had my brother purchase one 4 days later...
"04  7, 2019",2019 RAV4 very comfortable for an SUV and reliable,The RAV4 is a great car and enjoyable to drive. After a long day trip most SUV’s are so uncomfortable to ride in that  you cannot wait to get out of it! The RAV4 is a great car for a comfortable  road trip with plenty of room for all your stuff!
"04  7, 2019",Disappointing,"Put 5,000 miles on. Disappointed with road and wind noise and lack of power. 
Big mistake leasing this.
Way to much wind and road noise on the highway."
"04  5, 2019",I just bought a 2019 Rav4,"I like the 2019 Rav 4 but seriously frustrated that Toyota does not make a trailer hitch for this vehicle.  In addition, you can not buy a trailer hitch from a 3rd party.  Not available yet.  Having known this up front, I would have considered other SUV options."
"04  3, 2019",This Car Stinks!,"Just leased the 2019 Rav4. I have owned Toyotas for the past 25 years. Just turned in my leased 2016 Highlander and leased the 2019 Rav4. What a piece of crap. I knew I was downsizing so I wasn't expecting the luxuries I had with my Highlander but this is ridiculous. My only ""must have"" was blind side monitor. I went with the LE AWD. 
1. Passenger seat too high with no way to adjust. You have to stick your whole head in first before you can get in the darn thing. 
2. Pretty sure they are going to have to recall this lemon. If you take your foot off the gas going around a corner then hit the gas again on the other side of the curve the whole darn car hesitates then lurches forward. Actually afraid to let my new teen driver use this car. Dangerous. 
3. Lousy and I mean lousy acceleration - and LOUD...seriously loud. 
4. Seats are too narrow. 
5. Entune just plain stinks. Screen display is very flat with little ability to make it more attractive. Apple car play ok but come on Toyota...this is the best you can do? 
Thank goodness I leased the darn thing. Don't buy this one!"
"04  2, 2019",Safe and Reliable SUV,"This vehicle meets all of my needs from a safety standpoint, leg room, and cargo space.  Plus the gas mileage is great and the interior controls are right at your finger tips!!"
"04  1, 2019",I think its amazing,"I don't know why people complain about noise...its really not that bad. Not like its a v8 Mustang lol. Also the power isn't bad for the size of the vehicle, I mean its SUV not a Mustang again...Press the sport button instead of driving in ECO mode and you will definitely feel the difference! I don't care much about saving a mile or two per gallon so I keep it in ""Sport"" mostly and its amazing. Yeah I wish it had a bit more room as I had in my 2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross (Was a much roomier vehicle...) but with features I have and quality I believe it will last a long time. Oh btw I am 6'1 and have no issues with seeing out the window or touching the roof...Again yes its lower then Mitsu I drove, but overall its ok for its size..."
"03 30, 2019",I love my new RAV4!  It's so comfortable to drive!,"I bought the 2019 RAV4 AWD in Blue Flame.  It's a gorgeous vehicle and love the sunroof.  I've been really enjoying that.  It's got a lot of great features and this is the first AWD SUV that I've ever had.  

Toyota - Oh, what a feeling!"
"03 29, 2019",Redesigned Rav4 is more bold,"I loved my last Rav4. Very reliable car. The new one is even better. Love the new design. Can't wait to try it's 4 wheel drive capabilities.  Good gas mileage, roomy inside considering its class as compact SUV."
"03 28, 2019",My first car,I decided to buy this car because I trust Toyota. I believe for money I had paid they put all value that is possible into that car.
"03 27, 2019",Purchased yesterday .Too soon,Just purchased yesterday. So far I am very satsfied .I owned a Subaru Lagacy prior to this Vehicle and still too soon to answer this question.
"03 26, 2019",Love the vehcile,I love the vechicle and styling and it's a nice drive. The dealership I worked with made it a horrible experience and the vehicle did not come with features I was promised. But the vechicle over all is a nice vechicle just make sure it has the features you want and like.
"03 26, 2019",Best car for me.,"This vehicle has everything I need for comfort, performance, style, not to mention the confidence I feel behind the wheel with all of the safety features included."
"03 25, 2019",best suv for the money,"just ordered the top of the range hybrid model ,I test drove 2x before purchasing and really could not fault it, i dont agree with the too noisey comments if you drive it the way it was intended to be driven it is near perfect, if i want speed and noise i drive my mustang . this car is your typical family runaround give it a break , for the commenter’s out there complaining its to noisey stop thrashing it its not a v8 get a grip !!"
"03 25, 2019",I love it,It was such an upgrade from my old clunker. I love how comfy and quiet it is. I've had such a great experience so far
"03 23, 2019","I wanted a vehicle I can rely on, especially in WI","I'm enjoying it - still learning all it can do.  It has a lot of safety features I was looking for.  My son has a Rav 4, so I new a few things it could do!"
"03 21, 2019","So far, so good",My last RAV4 gave  me no problems after three years of use I hope this new one does as well it rides better and feels even more comfortable than my 2016 RAV4.
"03 21, 2019","Love my Rav 4, so happy!!!","My Rav 4 is roomy, drives nice, good pickup and all those safety features are great. Never thought about the Rav 4 until I test drove it. Looks nice too."
"03 21, 2019",BEST MIDSIZE SUV IVE EVER OWNED,I’m very impressed with the roominess this midsize suv has. I traded in my 2018 GMC Yukon because it was really too big for just me. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to downsize.
"03 21, 2019",More cons than pros,"We test drove today. I initially thought the headroom was lacking. My husband’s head was almost touching the ceiling. I thought the passenger seat was fairly uncomfortable too and it was a short ride. I was disappointed that the base didn’t have a power lift gate given all the other upgrades that were included. Wasn’t a huge fan of the large screen partially blocking the windshield and visibility out the front window seemed a bit compromised at the top too because of the roof slope. I also wasn’t a fan of the large bump in the  floor of the backseat. 

One pro is all of the included safety features although there were lots of beeps, etc. (most intentional to test it out or to avoid speed bumps) could get annoying on a longer trip. 

I love the exterior appearance."
"03 20, 2019",Amazingly redesigned!,"This new RAV4 is gorgeous!!  I am not even mad when i see another one on the road.  I just think to myself, "" Now thats a good looking ride!"". I bought it this week and saw one show up in my parking lot at work.  I walked over to see how pretty the one some stranger bought.  It was just as sleek and gorgeous as mine.  I was jealous for a second, then i walked back to mine and the jealousy subsided.  Great Job Toyota!!  Grocery getter gone, all wheel drive rugged man card earned back!!!"
"03 16, 2019",Couldn't be happier,The car is perfect for our situation. Plenty of room. I love all the tech that's in it. Only negative I can say is it's a little light pickup but I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
"03 15, 2019",Great Vehicle,"This car met my needs.  Had everything I wanted: power liftgate, blind spot warning, rear crossing warning and auto start.

And it was the color I wanted."
"03 13, 2019",Love it so far,"More rear seat room than our pathfinder and we’ll over twice the mpg. I think the value is in the awd le. It’s loaded with standard equipment and we average 34 mpg. It’s the Corolla of SUV’s. Definitely not a status symbol, a sports car, an off road vehicle or a luxury car. It’s just a reliable, economical, comfortable, safe and convenient vehicle. I don’t understand how people review cars. No one buys cars under $30k expecting quite luxurious performance with awd. You can hear the little engine working hard to save you fuel but it’ll hang in there decades after being paid off."
"03 12, 2019",Best mid size suv!,"Love everything about it. Better then the crv, Mazda, and forester! Has a more aggressive look to it and is very roomie. Best Rav 4 design!"
"03 12, 2019",Vision is a problem,Im a bigger taller guy and have issues seeing out the front window.  The rearview mirror and black plastic behind it makes it hard to see out. Find myself constantly bending my head down to see to the right. If the plastic wasn't there I may be able to see over the top of the mirror.
"03 11, 2019",ENTUNE 3.0 REMOTE CONNECT DOES NOT WORK.,"Nice styling, excellent ride and handling, lots of safety features, but ENTUNE 3.0 PREMIUM IN 40K RAV4 LIMITIED AWD, DOES NOT WORK. Don't waste your money. Multiple emails to Toyota, phone calls, customer service, case openings to solve problem. NO RESOLUTION, JUST THE SAME LINE OF HOW TO INSTALL FROM TOYOTA AND THEIR NEEDING MORE INFO. CAN'T GIVE THEM MORE THEN THEY AHVE. DOESN'T WORK,"
"03 11, 2019",Love my new Rav4,"This car is the perfect fit for me. I love how it drives.  The interior is a creamy leather -which I love.  It has all the bells and whistles and I'm still learning all the details on the dashboard. I love that it connects to my iphone and that makes it super easy to see my contacts and apps, play music, etc."
"03 10, 2019",Excellent product,"This is my second RAV.  They just keep getting better and better!  We got a 2019 which reportedly took a giant leap in mpg.  So far, so good!  I just wish I'd been able to go up one level.  I'm really short and having the automatic hatch opener and closer would be great.  I also have been having a hard time remembering that I have to use the key to start the car!  The backup camera is excellent - a huge improvement from the guideline-less camera in my Lexus.  My husband is wild about the lane departure feature (he thinks I'm a terrible driver...)."
"03  8, 2019",Awesome job on the restyle!,"This car is my 3rd Rav4. I love how roomy it is and the safety features that are now standard!
Looks great and gets awesome gas mileage."
"03  5, 2019",Excelente,"Me encanto el carro desde que lo vi, el color el espacio, es un carro familiar, me encanta todo el carro el espacio.... Definitivamente es hermoso"
"03  5, 2019",Me encantó el carro desde que lo vi.,"Es un carro hermoso, el frontal es bellisimo, por dentro es un carro espacioso y muy comodo para la familia, el maletero es grande ... Definitivamente me encanta"
"03  5, 2019",Es un vehiculo espacioso y comodo,"Es un vehiculo hermoso por fuera, el frontal hermoso, por dentro es espacioso y muy comodo, la maletera es grandisima, definitivamente un vehiculo ideal para la familia"
"03  4, 2019","Good value, well designed.","This car meets or exceeds our expectations for creature comforts, safety, well designed interior. Great gas mileage, (38.8mpg) on first trip. We would recommend this car for anyone with a small family. The dealer was a very positive experience."
"02 27, 2019",I just purchased this yesterday,"I love it so far! It’s a smooth ride, attractive, love the eco mode. It’s a very extractive car inside and out. I will know more when I’ve had it longer."
"02 27, 2019",I love this car after I test drove it.,"The vehicle meets all my needs I live up by the Canadian Border. The snow, mud and sand extra buttons impressed me greatly I have 4 x 4 before and was worried about buying a AWD vehicle."
"02 27, 2019",This is my 3rd RAV4......very reliable.,This is my 3rd RAV4 and it is very reliable and I feel very comfortable in it in both good weather as well as the snow.  It handles very well.  I also like its size.
"02 26, 2019",too soon to tell.........,"too soon to tell   but I like the mpg so far   interior too crowded  not enough room for handbag, litter bag or other items needed"
"02 25, 2019",Second RAV4,I like the RAV4 design this is our second one we've owned and if this one is as reliable as the first I'll be very satisfied.
"02 25, 2019",Still getting used to it,Not sure yet. Went from a roomy van to smaller vehicle.  Not enough room for litter bag;  women’s handbag;  print on screens too small to b safely read if driving! Mileage good
"02 25, 2019",Reliability!,"My 2nd Rav4. This new design is head and shoulders above last. Little noisey yes, but it trains you not to have a heavy foot."
"02 22, 2019",Excessive Road Noise,"I love everything about this SUV except the noise, if I had ever realized how bad it was I would not have purchased. I have bread some complaints about the window Waze I don’t find that a problem it is the road noise when you are on the highway that is incredibly annoying! Have an appointment with the dealer to see whatcan be done if anything...,I’m not sure if it’s engine noise, drive shaft or tire noise??"

I’ve owned a Toyota since 2006 and I’ve never, ever had a problem with them. They are built well & made to last. If you’re looking for dependability & quality, Toyota is it! All the safety features & the way it handles is top on my list. I highly recommend Toyota’s"

"02 19, 2019",Needs refinement.,"To me, the RAV4 seems underpowered and noisy.   When you put the pedal down, there is a lot of engine noise but not much acceleration.     At speed, though, the engine quiets down and the ride is pleasant and smooth.    I like the overall styling, but don't like the fake plastic skid plates or the hideous and cheap wheel well plastic trim.   Exterior color choices are limited.   The black adventure model, with the white (ice) top looks like a police car.      Can get expensive (up to $40K) if you opt for the Limited or Adventure models with a few options.   None of this matters however, if you are looking for a reliable and dependable vehicle.   None better than Toyota."

"02 15, 2019",Love my new RAV4,"I love the lane assist and how it brakes if you get to close to something in front of you. I also love the good gas mileage on this despite it being an SUV. Without traffic on the highway, I get 31mpg."

"02 12, 2019",A beautiful car,Mason meet all my car needs! It was quick and easy! So glad that he helped me out. He was very knowledgeable about the new RAV4. He understood everything I needed in a car and found the perfect car for me. I would recommend Mason to my family and friends.
"02 10, 2019",Great vehicle,I had and/or have Rav4 2012.....2015......2016 now I drive 2019 Rav4 he safety features are the best what a complete upgrade of the entire car...Fantastic job!
"02  9, 2019",Very reliable,This car meets all of my needs. Drives well and there is plenty of room as well as being very fuel efficient. The car also has many safety features.
"02  8, 2019",First new car,I love this car and it meets all my expectations except it doesn't come with a remote start yet. That was important for me but the manufacturer hasn't made the 2019 RAV4 with them yet.

"01 29, 2019",Lexus,Do not buy  a 2019 rav4  wind comes through the driver side  door  and toyota think that is normal .been to the dealer more than five times still they have not fixed my car
"01 27, 2019",Super nice car,"2019 RAV4 is totally redesigned & amazing! Interior is gorgeous, has an amazing stereo system with 11 speakers, rear heat/air, very quiet & smooth handling! Highly recommended! 5 stars all the way!!"
"01 23, 2019",Luxury meets rugged,"Nice design without being freakish, easy buttons to use without the WHAT'S THAT FOR!! peppy, the adventure model feels bigger without being cramp, easy on gas..........good everyday driver you can feel good about"
"01 20, 2019",Rave for the Rav4,I upgraded from a 2013 Rav4 to the newly redesigned 2019 RAV4 xle and I am not disappointed. The improved gas mileage is a plus along with the upgrades in technology especially the blindspot assist.  The engine can be a little loud as it goes through the first four out of eight speeds but quiets down after that.  It has been good in the snow so far but I do think the added snow mode is a bit of overkill since I have AWD.  The dashboard is much softer than the hard plastic I had in my old rav4 but the inside door handles seem much cheaper along with a very thin gas cap door compared to my 2013.  Other than the door handles and gas cap door I can’t complain.  The info center is easy to use and really doesn’t take much getting used to once you look it over.  I personally love the redesign and overall I am pleased with my purchase.
"01 20, 2019",Beautiful car,I love my new RAV4. This is my second RAV4 and u couldn’t be happier . I would recommend this car because it’s reliabke and comfortable and drives great
"01 19, 2019",Great SUV for daily commute,"I just bought it a few weeks ago. I love the new redesign. Everything works and runs great. It’s a little bit of a bumpy ride, but comes with lots of great perks that i use often (apple car play, heavy towing capacity, more spacious than many other crossovers, great mpg)"

"01  1, 2019",My Rav4 rack it,This vehicle is mid price good performance and can rack my boat and Carrying for paddling stuff to races across CA and Oregon. The price is good for mud size SUV and Toyota is the only brand I drive.
"12 30, 2018","Great Design, Needs Better Performance","I have test drove the 2019 Toyota Rav4 being completely redesigned. First, Toyota did an amazing job in design on this car giving it a very aggressive appearance. Unfortunately, it is lacking in power."
"12 28, 2018",I traded in my Subaru for this Rav4 and love it.,I owned a 2002 Subaru outback and never thought I would own another brand until my husband bought his highlander recently. I saw the Rav4 and fell in love with it and the design and now own it.
"12 27, 2018",It’s amazing car,This car has great exterior design and modern design. I can say it will be number 1 in the world especially when in the Middle East
"12 26, 2018",Really liked it but felt awkward,"This Rav4 is a beautiful SUV, has everything in it I wished for. But getting in I found overhead too low, bumping my head in doorway. And front visibility felt awkward, looking over the high front hood. Otherwise, it was great... but second choice."
"12 21, 2018",Best Generation RAV4 Yet!,"I had my Avalon Hybrid in for service at my local Toyota dealer when I saw a 2019 RAV4 on the lot sitting next to the 2018s.  The body style immediately grabbed me.  The new front end's aggressive masculinity is perfect.  The way the light played on the ruby red pearl colored side body panels was amazing.  Though I'm waiting for the RAV4 Hybrid release I couldn't help but drive this ICE version.  The interior is laid out so everything makes sense and is within reach.  The driver's seat was comfortable as my Avalon.  The vehicle drives, rides and sounds great."

It’s the Corolla of SUV’s. Definitely not a status symbol, a sports car, an off road vehicle or a luxury car. It’s just a reliable, economical, comfortable, safe and convenient vehicle. I don’t understand how people review cars. No one buys cars under $30k expecting quite luxurious performance with awd. You can hear the little engine working hard to save you fuel but it’ll hang in there decades after being paid off."
"03 12, 2019",Best mid size suv!,"Love everything about it. Better then the crv, Mazda, and forester! Has a more aggressive look to it and is very roomie. Best Rav 4 design!"
"03 12, 2019",Vision is a problem,Im a bigger taller guy and have issues seeing out the front window.  The rearview mirror and black plastic behind it makes it hard to see out.

"02 27, 2019",I just purchased this yesterday,"I love it so far! It’s a smooth ride, attractive, love the eco mode. It’s a very extractive car inside and out. I will know more when I’ve had it longer."
"02 27, 2019",I love this car after I test drove it.,"The vehicle meets all my needs I live up by the Canadian Border. The snow, mud and sand extra buttons impressed me greatly I have 4 x 4 before and was worried about buying a AWD vehicle."

"02 25, 2019",Still getting used to it,Not sure yet. Went from a roomy van to smaller vehicle.  Not enough room for litter bag;  women’s handbag;  print on screens too small to b safely read if driving! Mileage good
"02 25, 2019",Reliability!,"My 2nd Rav4. This new design is head and shoulders above last. Little noisey yes, but it trains you not to have a heavy foot."
"02 22, 2019",Excessive Road Noise,"I love everything about this SUV except the noise, if I had ever realized how bad it was I would not have purchased. I have bread some complaints about the window Waze I don’t find that a problem it is the road noise when you are on the highway that is incredibly annoying! Have an appointment with the dealer to see whatcan be done if anything...,I’m not sure if it’s engine noise, drive shaft or tire noise??"

"03  5, 2019",Me encantó el carro desde que lo vi.,"Es un carro hermoso, el frontal es bellisimo, por dentro es un carro espacioso y muy comodo para la familia, el maletero es grande ... Definitivamente me encanta"
"03  5, 2019",Es un vehiculo espacioso y comodo,"Es un vehiculo hermoso por fuera, el frontal hermoso, por dentro es espacioso y muy comodo, la maletera es grandisima, definitivamente un vehiculo ideal para la familia"
"03  4, 2019","Good value, well designed.","This car meets or exceeds our expectations for creature comforts, safety, well designed interior. Great gas mileage, (38.8mpg) on first trip. We would recommend this car for anyone with a small family. The dealer was a very positive experience."
"02 27, 2019",I just purchased this yesterday,"I love it so far! It’s a smooth ride, attractive, love the eco mode. It’s a very extractive car inside and out. I will know more when I’ve had it longer."
"02 27, 2019",I love this car after I test drove it.,"The vehicle meets all my needs I live up by the Canadian Border. The snow, mud and sand extra buttons impressed me greatly I have 4 x 4 before and was worried about buying a AWD vehicle."
"02 27, 2019",This is my 3rd RAV4......very reliable.,This is my 3rd RAV4 and it is very reliable and I feel very comfortable in it in both good weather as well as the snow.  It handles very well.  I also like its size.
"02 26, 2019",too soon to tell.........,"too soon to tell   but I like the mpg so far   interior too crowded  not enough room for handbag, litter bag or other items needed"
"02 25, 2019",Second RAV4,I like the RAV4 design this is our second one we've owned and if this one is as reliable as the first I'll be very satisfied.
"02 25, 2019",Still getting used to it,Not sure yet. Went from a roomy van to smaller vehicle.  Not enough room for litter bag;  women’s handbag;  print on screens too small to b safely read if driving! Mileage good
"02 25, 2019",Reliability!,"My 2nd Rav4. This new design is head and shoulders above last. Little noisey yes, but it trains you not to have a heavy foot."
"02 22, 2019",Excessive Road Noise,"I love everything about this SUV except the noise, if I had ever realized how bad it was I would not have purchased. I have bread some complaints about the window Waze I don’t find that a problem it is the road noise when you are on the highway that is incredibly annoying! Have an appointment with the dealer to see whatcan be done if anything...,I’m not sure if it’s engine noise, drive shaft or tire noise??"
"02 22, 2019",Quality & Performance,"I absolutely love this vehicle! It’s a sharp looking car. 
I’ve owned a Toyota since 2006 and I’ve never, ever had a problem with them. They are built well & made to last. If you’re looking for dependability & quality, Toyota is it! All the safety features & the way it handles is top on my list. I highly recommend Toyota’s"
"02 22, 2019",Good car to own and drive,This car meet the need of my family. Big room have plenty of leg room and the interior is nice and clear. A lot of color to choose from.
"02 21, 2019",Very impressed with Car,This current met my expectations  and keeps impressing me with the more  features it has I really like how the car has Apple play and just connects to my phone
"02 19, 2019",Needs refinement.,"To me, the RAV4 seems underpowered and noisy.   When you put the pedal down, there is a lot of engine noise but not much acceleration.     At speed, though, the engine quiets down and the ride is pleasant and smooth.    I like the overall styling, but don't like the fake plastic skid plates or the hideous and cheap wheel well plastic trim.   Exterior color choices are limited.   The black adventure model, with the white (ice) top looks like a police car.      Can get expensive (up to $40K) if you opt for the Limited or Adventure models with a few options.   None of this matters however, if you are looking for a reliable and dependable vehicle.   None better than Toyota."
"02 18, 2019",2019 rave 4 xle,"I test drive rave 4 2019 xle today very good comfort car  , to much space, easy to drive absolutely loved . I just go to test drive the car I be come out buy the car same day  absolutely loved and recommend thank you toyota ✌️❤️"
"02 17, 2019",Best Rav4 Ever!!,"I transitioned from my 09' Corrolla to this. For MN weather, the AWD feature of this car is superb. Also, the interior is roomier and Toyota SS 2.0 outstanding!!"
"02 15, 2019",Love my new RAV4,"I love the lane assist and how it brakes if you get to close to something in front of you. I also love the good gas mileage on this despite it being an SUV. Without traffic on the highway, I get 31mpg."
"02 13, 2019","I love the new design, more modern","Have had orther Toyota rave 4 cars have enjoyed them all, never had any problem with them, would tell any one about my new car just love it"
"02 12, 2019",A beautiful car,Mason meet all my car needs! It was quick and easy! So glad that he helped me out. He was very knowledgeable about the new RAV4. He understood everything I needed in a car and found the perfect car for me. I would recommend Mason to my family and friends.
"02 10, 2019",Great vehicle,I had and/or have Rav4 2012.....2015......2016 now I drive 2019 Rav4 he safety features are the best what a complete upgrade of the entire car...Fantastic job!
"02  9, 2019",Very reliable,This car meets all of my needs. Drives well and there is plenty of room as well as being very fuel efficient. The car also has many safety features.
"02  8, 2019",First new car,I love this car and it meets all my expectations except it doesn't come with a remote start yet. That was important for me but the manufacturer hasn't made the 2019 RAV4 with them yet.
"01 31, 2019",Most reliable car I've owned.,"This car meets all of my needs. The inside is spacy, with plenty of cargo space. I love that I sit high up and can see well beyond the hood. The auto-correct while driving is very responsive."
"01 31, 2019",3rd Rav4,"i love the RAV 4. it is compact but roomy.  i can transport my bike in the back and all my stuff, yet not have to maneuver a large SUV.  My new one rides like a car.  It has so many gadgets i'm not sure i'll ever use them all but i love the security features, the auto high beams and too many other conveniences to mention"
"01 29, 2019",Lexus,Do not buy  a 2019 rav4  wind comes through the driver side  door  and toyota think that is normal .been to the dealer more than five times still they have not fixed my car
"01 27, 2019",Super nice car,"2019 RAV4 is totally redesigned & amazing! Interior is gorgeous, has an amazing stereo system with 11 speakers, rear heat/air, very quiet & smooth handling! Highly recommended! 5 stars all the way!!"
"01 23, 2019",Luxury meets rugged,"Nice design without being freakish, easy buttons to use without the WHAT'S THAT FOR!! peppy, the adventure model feels bigger without being cramp, easy on gas..........good everyday driver you can feel good about"
"01 20, 2019",Rave for the Rav4,I upgraded from a 2013 Rav4 to the newly redesigned 2019 RAV4 xle and I am not disappointed. The improved gas mileage is a plus along with the upgrades in technology especially the blindspot assist.  The engine can be a little loud as it goes through the first four out of eight speeds but quiets down after that.  It has been good in the snow so far but I do think the added snow mode is a bit of overkill since I have AWD.  The dashboard is much softer than the hard plastic I had in my old rav4 but the inside door handles seem much cheaper along with a very thin gas cap door compared to my 2013.  Other than the door handles and gas cap door I can’t complain.  The info center is easy to use and really doesn’t take much getting used to once you look it over.  I personally love the redesign and overall I am pleased with my purchase.
"01 20, 2019",Beautiful car,I love my new RAV4. This is my second RAV4 and u couldn’t be happier . I would recommend this car because it’s reliabke and comfortable and drives great
"01 19, 2019",Great SUV for daily commute,"I just bought it a few weeks ago. I love the new redesign. Everything works and runs great. It’s a little bit of a bumpy ride, but comes with lots of great perks that i use often (apple car play, heavy towing capacity, more spacious than many other crossovers, great mpg)"
"01 16, 2019",Toyota lover,"This car met my expectations. Drives like a luxury car. Love new body style, worth the money and the wait for the 2019 model. Very satisfied customer."
"01 15, 2019",Smooth and reliable drive !,"I am very happy with this car! Comfortable, roomy, good mileage , exciting to drive each day! Looking forward to taking long road trips this year"
"01  9, 2019",Love my car,Was looking for a small SUV for the winter.  My RAV4 is awesome in all types of weather.  Especially snow. Comfortable to drive.  Fits all my stuff too.
"01  8, 2019",VERY ENJOYABLE TO DRIVE,"GREAT CAR, TOYOTA DID A GREAT JOB WITH THIS NEW VEHICLE, GREAT JOB RESTYLING THE OUT SIDE AND INSIDE, ENJOYABLE DRIVING AND MANY SAFTEY FEATURES."
"01  4, 2019",Love it !,Love the new body style of the new 2019 Rav4. It has new updated safety road features with lane assist and cruise control.  The extra cargo space is great. The Rav4 still gets excellent highway gas mileage.  I am very pleased with my purchase and went from a 2014 to a 2019.  Can't see myself driving anything else but a Rav4.
"01  1, 2019",Awesome new body style 2019 Toyota RAV4,"Just picked up a new 2019 Rav4, love it! We had the 2016 Rav4 and this one is head over heels superior. rides better, more power, better fuel economy, classier look."
"01  1, 2019",My Rav4 rack it,This vehicle is mid price good performance and can rack my boat and Carrying for paddling stuff to races across CA and Oregon. The price is good for mud size SUV and Toyota is the only brand I drive.
"12 30, 2018","Great Design, Needs Better Performance","I have test drove the 2019 Toyota Rav4 being completely redesigned. First, Toyota did an amazing job in design on this car giving it a very aggressive appearance. Unfortunately, it is lacking in power."
"12 28, 2018",I traded in my Subaru for this Rav4 and love it.,I owned a 2002 Subaru outback and never thought I would own another brand until my husband bought his highlander recently. I saw the Rav4 and fell in love with it and the design and now own it.
"12 27, 2018",It’s amazing car,This car has great exterior design and modern design. I can say it will be number 1 in the world especially when in the Middle East
"12 26, 2018",Really liked it but felt awkward,"This Rav4 is a beautiful SUV, has everything in it I wished for. But getting in I found overhead too low, bumping my head in doorway. And front visibility felt awkward, looking over the high front hood. Otherwise, it was great... but second choice."
"12 21, 2018",Best Generation RAV4 Yet!,"I had my Avalon Hybrid in for service at my local Toyota dealer when I saw a 2019 RAV4 on the lot sitting next to the 2018s.  The body style immediately grabbed me.  The new front end's aggressive masculinity is perfect.  The way the light played on the ruby red pearl colored side body panels was amazing.  Though I'm waiting for the RAV4 Hybrid release I couldn't help but drive this ICE version.  The interior is laid out so everything makes sense and is within reach.  The driver's seat was comfortable as my Avalon.  The vehicle drives, rides and sounds great."
"12 21, 2018",love the imporvements,drive it and yo will see why so many people love this car.  A lot more spacious than the previous model.  and it looks better too.
"12 16, 2018",Finally a man can buy this crossover,"The styling is finally not overly feminine and the interior is a lot quieter than previous models...  Glad for the make over!  Now, please give us a chance at an optional turbo engine!"
"12  1, 2018",Worst looking ugly suv ever. Negative stars.,Why the gansgta grille? It?s the ugliest Rav ever. How?s this an improvement? Bring back the sporty styling of the mid 2000?s please. I won?t drive that hulk.
"09 23, 2018",OMG the exterior is down right ugly ugly ugly.,"The ride feels peppier than '18.  nbr of USB port and CarPlay is nice.  Some of the safety feature still too aggressive, especially lane warning.  It feels quieter than '18.  shifting somewhat odd during heavier foot.  The exterior look like facelift went wrong.  From the front, a face not even a mother would love."
"05 18, 2024",bought this vehicle new.,"bought this vehicle new. in & out for repairs....parts keep breaking or burning out. last repair $1700, electric break control issue. defective part.
prior another defective part $825...this one I argued with Toyota & got them to reimburse me. 
always had honda/ acuras. never any major problems over 20 years."
"10 29, 2023",Very happy with my purchase,After purchase I immediately took the car on an 800 mile road trip. It is much more comfortable and rides more smoothly than our older RAV4 and had plenty of pep for highway driving. Averaged over 37 MPG at highway speed of 70-80 MPH. Would have liked a power hatchback but overall I’m very satisfied with the options that came with it as an LE model.
"10 22, 2023",Not worth the money.,I bought a 2020 Rav 4 it has been in the shop more then anything. Always some with voltage and power steering.  Computer updates. I have sank more money into repairs then anything else. Not reliable or dependable for what I paid for the vehicle.
"10  9, 2023",toyota get in the game,no matter how basic a car the ability to open your garage door should be standard.  rav4 LE strips too many basic needs.  toyota stop being cheap get in the game
"06  9, 2023",Going Places,"Definition of practical while being affordable. All the bad reviews are because the geniuses who purchases them did no research. Auto Off engine kills your battery life, leaving it off is perfect. Packed with safety features, you want your kids in this car 100%. 28 mpg in the city and 35+ in 55 MPH zones. I get 38 mpg highway normally. Sure you can pay $35k+ for a hybrid, but this is well engineered already."
"05 24, 2023",Rav 4 2020,"2020 rav4 engine maintenance and they say is valve..$600 that is crazy..

Do not buy rav4 they say all rav 4 have this issue but it is not a recall.."
"02 11, 2023",Rav4 Battery dead at 2.5 years,"Car would not start at 25500 miles and 2.5 years.   Battery completely dead.  Trying to get battery recharged.  We drive car regularly, so there is NO reason for battery to be dead. 
Horrible situation to find car want start after only 2.5 years.
Checking on a used Honda."
"12 17, 2022",Highly Recommend,"We just bought a 2020 Rav4 LE as a Toyota Certified car with 21,500 miles.  We downsized (literally) from a 20 year old Sequoia, so we're getting accustomed to the smaller size.  My only complaint is that the cup holders seem to be a bit awkward.  I love the design and the all of the safety features and the handling while driving."
"11 14, 2022",Re: Rav 4 purchase,"I had a great experience when purchasing my new car. The says rep at Toyota of Lincoln Park, Edgar Rivera was extremely knowledgeable and professional."
"09 27, 2022",a little bit expensive but worthy,only concern I have is the tire pressure sensor(s) are a little bit sensitive.  This including the spare tire carried its own sensor. You only used spare tire once a while not daily.  quality is good. no CVT transmission problems for Adventure model. The 4 wheels drive for adventure is amazing drove in heavy rain Floody conditions without a scratch (which Forester and CRV were parking on roadside cannot move)
"09  8, 2022",Not as good as U think,Rough suspension and way too much road noise. Getting in and out will be more difficult for tall or long legged people as you sit very low even with drivers seat elevated. Radio is probably the best part of this vehicle as it has lots of tunable settings and good volume for those who like it loud. Windows fog up bad and take too long to clear when parked. Does not heat up fast like a V-8 does. Gas mileage is about half what is advertised and that is not good. Overall I couldn't get to a good review on this. 3.5/5 at best.
"09  2, 2022",Viva de milagro.,"RAVA 4 2020…frenos fallaron y aceleró grandemente. Se llenó de humo blanco…
Paramos en una cuneta en construcción perdida total… vivos de milagro.
15 meses de uso. TERRIBLE!!!"
"04 25, 2022",Love our Rav!!,"Virtually nothing has gone wrong with my 2020 RAV4. I have a small bit of buyer remorse, because wear hearing aids and there is a lot of road noise in my Rav. The Venza model turns out to be more luxurious and is much quieter. But, it has trade offs, as well. I might have gone with that, had I known. But the Rav is a great vehicle, no actual regrets. Lots of power when one needs it. And the breaking system kept me out of an accident, several months ago, the brakes went on when someone pulled out in front of me from a side road. I was not looking in that direction, and never would have braked soon enough. We recently went on a road trip from Washington state to Southern California and we’re delighted when we got 42 MPG. Great car, no regrets, maybe I’ll take it somewhere for some soundproofing."
"04  8, 2022","Old is gold, very reliable","I inherited this car from my grandmother, she bought it new in 2000 and barely ever drove it, so it was in great condition when I ended up getting it back in 2014. I've put about 50,000 miles on it between work, high school, and college. I love this little car, it's never given me an issue and is more reliable than some of my friends' cars from 2010 or newer. The interior leaves a bit to be desired; it's comfortable but the design of the dashboard isn't great and the cupholders are basically useless and get in the way of the gear changer. Well, back in y2k drinks weren't as big as they are now so I can hardly blame them, but it does still suck when I go to put my car in park and the stick won't even go all the way forward because my water bottle is blocking it. The paint coat was excellent and has only just recently (about 2019ish) began to oxidize and peel its topcoat. The SUV style isn't for everyone, but I like roomy, boxy cars like this one. One thing I REALLY appreciate is how quickly the AC and heating kick in. Being from south California, I need the AC to come on as quickly as possible in the hot summer, and my RAV4 is cooled down by the time I leave my driveway. This car has 129,000 miles on it, and I think I can take it for another 80,000 at least. It doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of a newer car with heated seats and electric door locks, but for its time it is more than a wonderful car, and I'll be sticking with Toyota for my next car as well."
"04  2, 2022",It was not a new car it had 300 hundred miles and,I traded 2 cars for this Rava 4 had 300.00 miles and they sold it to me for a New Car but it was not a new car with that many miles I will not buy another Toyota SUV from Sparks Toyota At Myrtle beach I was sick and I tole them I did not feel like messing with it but they pressure me in getting and I told them over and over that I did not feel like trading and they kept on and on they just done me wrong they should pay me for putting me thru all that stuff it was not right so what can I do about that let me know something thank
"03 24, 2021",A reliable car that's made very well,"I enjoy the car, going on long trips to Connecticut to visit my grandchildren never have to worry, I have told my friends about the RAV4 and two of them have bought it and are very happy"
"03 23, 2021",most reliable car I've owned,"This is the second Toyota I have owned. the first one being a 1989 Camry. it was my favorite car I have owned until now. I love Toyotas. they are reliable and comfortable. this car is no different, with the added bonus of being modern and having all the cool technology. I don't know how I lived with out Apple Car Play, before now. its a game changer. the seats in my  2020 XLE are what sold me. they are cloth and super comfortable. there is space for our family of four, without feeling like I am driving a bus. This SUV is perfect for us!"
"02 23, 2021",Smartphone,This car Quality is very good and this is a nice car. I love this car. Anyone can buy it at an affordable price. Thank you for sharing with us.
"02  4, 2021","Very Comfortable, smooth ride, and rekuable",I like sitting up higher and having a better view of the rode. It has comfortable seating and an easy to manage control panel. It is economical in terms of gas and oil
"01 31, 2021",I'm always be happy to have a Toyota as my car,"For me , Toyota is  the most best of the cars everyone should have for their family.  it's an economic car ,  it saves fuel  and it's a fighter vehicle."
"01 30, 2021",Best AWD SUV!,"Comfortable, best handling in the elements, Toyota reliability, all the features, great gas mileage, large trunk space. Only drawback to the XLE model is no sunroof and no power lift gate."
"01 24, 2021",Best Toyota so far,I absolutely love this car. I basically traded in my Toyotas every three years and I’ve had just about every model and this RAV4 is the most unbelievable car I’ve had I love it and definitely will get another one
"01  2, 2021",Least reliable car I have ever owned,"My 2020 Rav4 Hybrid has three major issues since purchased in August 2020. One, stalling, remains unresolved despite several attempts of the dealer to find the cause. Apparently many others have the same issue.
Another, 12v battery discharge due to heavy demand from various options, causes voltage levels to drop below that needed to start the car. A software fix and my taking initiative to deselect options such as automatic parking reduced demand on the battery. But the less-tna-full-size battery is an issue.  
A third issue, issues related to filling and pumping fuel from a redesigned gas tank, caused a lot of anxiety but has apparently been fixed.
Toyota's response has been less than I would expect given the widespread occurance of these issues.  Buyers were NOT advise of these issue when purchasing. Dealers service dept often expressed lack of awareness of the issues.
I do NOT recommend this car."
"12 30, 2020",Tbis was an Awesome purchase for my family,"This car is perfect for my family, we're enjoying the performance and room of the car. We took a trip a the ride was wonderful."
"12 22, 2020",Just bought it  So far I am happy but Give me time,"So Far I like it very much,  it is responsive. But since I have driven it for only 2 days i need l little more time to evaluate"
"12 18, 2020",Toyota RAV4,"This vehicle is really superb. It’s everything you need in a car. Hoping this last just like my Toyota Camry 06 model which I drove for 305,000 miles."
"12 16, 2020",issued,"paint not good and .
i wont buy toyota again the dealers when you come back them treat you very bad i will try next time another brand"
"12 15, 2020",I purchased a 2020 Rav 4 in February 2020 -,I've had nothing but problems out of this vehicle.  My dealership has replaced the battery 2 times - Spring and Winter 2020 - because something in this vehicle keeps depleting the battery.
"12  9, 2020",Fifth RAV4,"This is our 6th RAV 4 since 2009 under the lease program, not that previous RAVs have had issues but it's nice to drive a new car every few years and not have to worry about maintenance."
"11 29, 2020",RAV4 is a very comfortable easy to use vehicle tha,Vehicle had all the options that we could Asfoor to keep our daughter safe and with Toyota dependability and value what else can I say
"11 14, 2020",Love my car!,"My last car was a Nissan Sentra (never again Nissan). Last winter it got stuck in a quarter inch of snow on the tiniest incline in a parking lot. That’s when I knew I needed an SUV. Toyotas have always been reliable cars to me, and the new style of the RAV4 caught my eye, and I just knew I needed this car. Got a white XLE with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats and steering wheel, moonroof, premium sound system, power everything, push button start, etc. I love how it drives, super smooth and powerful for a 4-cylinder! I average about 28 miles to the gallon, and the Toyota Connect package is awesome! I can lock/unlock my doors, start my car remotely, and check the status of my car through the app! So cool! Also offers Wifi hotspot which has been good for my kids going on their virtual classrooms as we drive. Can’t wait to see what it can do in snow!"
"10 23, 2020",xxx Not good,"Never buy Toyota 
Should have gone with another manufacturer as nothing but problems which have not been repaired and not taken seriously by dealership as of now"
"10 21, 2020",Best Purchase!,"I am absolutely obsessed with my new Rav4! I previously owned a 2007 model and new when it was time to upgrade, I was going to stick with another Rav. The 2020 model is the best purchase I could have made, I am extremely thrilled and excited about it. Performance and reliability are so far a 100% in my book! I was at first apprehensive about the tire not being on the back any longer, as to me - that's what made the Rav stand out, but with the 2020, I love the new look of the body."
"10 21, 2020",Most comfortable vehicle I own,"This vehicle meets all my needs. The cabin is roomy with ample leg room. This by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned for long road trips. The blind spot monitor, back up camera and pre-collision system make this vehicle a truly safe, comfortable ride."
"10 20, 2020",2020 RAV4 Limited AWD,"We have driven a 2007 RAV4 limited AWD for almost 14 years.  It has been virtually trouble free so it was a no brainer to get the same car for the CEO (wife).  Have only driven it for a few hundred miles but the following stand out so far...

1.  Seating comfort is very good.
2.  The A/C makes it cold enough to hang meat inside the car.
3.  Pretty sporty looking for an SUV.
4.  So much info on the dash it will take some time to learn all of the functions.
5.  The addition of a trailer hitch for the bike rack virtually disables the ""Kick sensor"" for closing the back hatch.

Because of the short time of ownership, I cannot speak on the longevity or reliability of the car.   So far, so good and time will tell if this lives up to the reliability of our 2007 RAV4.  This survey makes you put in a rating for reliability"
"10 20, 2020",I love my suv,I'm greatly satisfied with my SUV. My salesman was very professional and showed me all about my new suv. I couldn't be more satisfied with it
"10 20, 2020",Best vehicle  I  have  every  owned.,"It's  beautiful  inside, lots of room. Safety  features  amazed me for the price I paid. All the features are easy to set. The ignition is  a little tricky  for me but I  am sure I  will adjust."
"10  8, 2020","Great Car, Last Toyota I will ever buy","Great Cars, Terrible People, dealer made buying a car worst than going to Dentist. Dealers sales Manager tried to chest bump me,A real Bully
Salesman turned out to be coward and disappeared"
"10  5, 2020",Lots of safety options in entry level car,We bought a new RAV4 for our oldest daughter and feel it’s the perfect car for her and our family. Not too small not too big and has a lot of safety features which will help a young driver. Toyotas are safe and dependable cars!
"10  4, 2020",Very good,It is the best car I have sevn years driving toyota RAV 4 it is a good car it is good driving saving on gaz
"10  3, 2020",Great multi-purpose vehicle!,"The car has done everything I've asked of it. Ride is great, plenty of power, loads of passenger and cargo space. I like it a lot!"
"09 30, 2020",Siempre quise tener ese carro,Me gusta mucho ese carro es lo que necesitaba hace tiempo me encanta lo recomiendo a las personas muy cómodo y espacioso además muy economivo
"09 30, 2020",Good looking vehicle.  Comfortable,"This car met all my needs.  Safety on the highway and added safety in extreme winter conditions.  Comfortable enough for an 8 hour drive on   highway,  crossing from state to state.   Good cruise control, as well as good navigation features and ease of audio use.   Room in the cargo  area for my golf bag and weekend bag."
"09 30, 2020","heard and read, now own","This car has plenty of leg room in the  front and esp in the back.  We were looking for a bigger space in the back for a medium dog cage to fit. The ride is quiet and the phone sounds nice thru blue tooth. Im not a music fan so anything will do, but the music sounds great with the system. I love the thick car matts that came with the vehicle and looking forward to testing out all the options."

"09 22, 2020",Most reliable car I've owned,"So happy I purchased this vehicle. Would highly recommend for a small family or even I single person. Plenty of leg room and cargo space. I have one in the color ""blue flame"" and it truly is a great car and very safe."

"09 10, 2020",Really good suv,It performs very well overall with some minor setbacks. Under heavy rai the blind spot sensors might not detect an approaching vehicle. Same goes for the lane departure warning system. Other than that great ride.
"09  5, 2020",Fun car,This car met all our needs. Affordable and reliable without giving up all the bells and whistles! Plenty of room for two teenage boys in the back seat and all their stuff!

"08 23, 2020",Regret buying a rav4,"I regret buying a rav4.  The vehicle has had a persistent rattle coming from the steering column and the dealer was unable to fix the problem.  In addition, the Bluetooth connection to an iPhone is unreliable.  Toyotas cost more than their competitors which is fine if you get superior quality but that’s not what I’m getting.  Buy a Honda instead."
"08 15, 2020",Toyota,"The car met my needs. Sporty. Like the way it drives. I am downsizing, but still enough room in the backseats. Lots of storage in the back"
"08 12, 2020",Reliable,Met my needs for driving both locally and highway.  Car has nice looks and feel.  I don't have any more comments to make  Simple car simple review
"08 12, 2020",Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,"My only concern is that I didn’t buy one sooner! It has so much room, fantastic on gas mileage and all the standard features are great."
"08 11, 2020",So far I'm very pleased!,My Rav 4 has met all my expectations since switching over from owning a Honda for many years. I have now chosen Toyota for reliability!
"08 10, 2020",I will continue tobuy this car because it reliable,This vehicle supports all of my needs. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this vehicle again when I want to trade in my leased vehicle. Larry H Miller dealership in Colorado Springs is my new favorite dealership for toyota vehicles.
"08  8, 2020",Fits like a glove feeling,"The only thing I wish would be a better take off from 0 mph to 60 mph.
The car is amazingly economical, despite its high center of gravity it does not lean at turns and behaves like a low seating Honda Accord.
It remains economical even when I I pull open trailer with the garden tractor on it!"
"08  7, 2020",Quality Vehicle,"The vehicle that I purchase exceeds all of my needs that I need to commute.  Comfortable ride, quiet and enough room to spare for passengers and cargo."
"08  6, 2020",Great car,Just purchased and already love it. So many high end features that are standard on this vehicle. You cannot beat a Toyota for value and performance!
"08  3, 2020",I feel safe in this SUV.,This SUV is well built. It is very spacious. I feel safe having my son in it  this SUV. I really like the color and the ability to be able to connect my phone to the vehicle.
"08  3, 2020",Still getting used to it.,"Although bought in February, I'm still trying to get used to certain new things that weren't on the 2014 RAV 4.  Such as the gas tank opener, which a friend had to find for me.  It's right next to the hood opener."
"08  1, 2020",Most reliable car I’ve ever purchased,"I am a very picky car shopper, I absolutely love this car I do not have any thing negative to report  . Fun to drive easy to use .  I love this rav 4"

"07 30, 2020",it is the perfect vehicle for me and my family,I really like this vehicle especially the new updated body type and its very comfortable interior as well. The size is perfect for me and my family.
"07 28, 2020",The 2020 RAV4 Does not Disappoint,"This SUV is spacious, drives well on both city streets, highways and dirt roads. The technology features are great and it’s not bad on gas at all! It’s not meant for anyone over 6’4” and stocky build like my husband.. But it’s a perfect fit for me! LOVE this ride!"
"07 27, 2020",RAV4 Hybrid Limited - Best RAV4 Ever,"This is my 4th RAV4 so obviously I am a fan. The hybrid has more power, more low end torque, and is just the most fun to drive of them all. Got all the bells and whistles and am enjoying the fun parts, but also appreciating the additional safety features. Thought the panoramic camera view would be just a toy but it is very useful for parking in tight places and not running over the dog. This model of RAV4 is a little longer and a little wider -- lots of room inside for the grandkid's car seats."
"07 26, 2020",Haven’t had a new car in 11 years,"This car was rated in the top 5 by Blue Book. I read several reviews before even test driving it. Performance is great, high tech and stylish. But three adults can’t fit comfortably which in the back seat, which is sad. I really wish the XLE, AWD included in the conference package or weather package self start and something very simple as a net to keep groceries and other items from moving back and forth In the cargo area."
"07 26, 2020",A++++++ Rav4 great step up!,"The car meet all our needs. I love that it has 5 usb ports, has CarPlay, the shape in front is fierce looking and a lot of trunk space."
"07 24, 2020",Great car,love the speed that this car delivers. Great gas mileage. It is what I have been looking for in a hybrid Car. Rav4 Limited Red
"07 23, 2020",Dream Car,"This car as been at the top of my purchase list for over 10 years. I’m so excited to finally own this SUV. My main reason for purchasing this vehicle is for the AWD, the additional “snow”, “sand/dirt”, “rock” features are a bonus. I also love that Toyota now has standard safety features which puts my mind at ease. All the new 2020 vehicles come with Car play as well so no need to worry about being distracted while driving. The absolute “cherry on top” is the 2 year maintenance free that Toyota offers on all their new vehicles. I’m in love with my new Toyota RAV4!!"
"07 20, 2020",Best Car and Dealership,"I test drove this Rav4 LE from Romeoville Toyota. My salesman Michael was so awesome at answering all of my questions and letting me test drive this vehicle! He gave me information on everything I needed to know about the vehicle and made my experience amazing! I am so excited to go back to purchase and I will definitely be referring Romeoville Toyota and Michael to anyone looking for a new, reliable car!"

"07  3, 2020",Very good for a small suv,Great gas Mil. and being a 2020 it has a lot of features that my 2017 did  have. The safety features  that you get with toyota make it worth looking at this brand.
"06 28, 2020",Shout Out to Easton Koons Toyota,"My 2nd vehicle from Easton Koons!  Gary and Brad worked hard to make sure I was totally satisfied and to get me in this Rav4!   Gotta give Easton Toyota a visit!  You won't be disappointed.  The service has always been good over the years  as well, just an all around good choice."
"06 27, 2020",I test drove the rav4 xle,It’s a pretty nice suv but there are so many packages it will dive you crazy! To get a good rave4 with bigger wheels you got to step up to a rav4 premium and then you get more stuff like adjustable seats Partial heated steering wheel but not everyone what’s all that stuff it can get very pricey for a rav4. I’m currently looking at a Mazda witch is like 5.000 to 7.000 cheaper then a rav4 depending on the packages you want to get .
"06 25, 2020",Great Vehicle. I love that it!,I love that it can pick up and go if I need it to. There are so many helpful options that I’m not quite used to yet. I know they will be easy to learn though. I love the comfort of the seats. The back seats are comfortable as well. So far I love everything.
"06 24, 2020",Very comfortable lots of leg room,The vehicle is very comfortable alot of safety features like the console it rides smooth and quiet.  Love that i can start it from my phone.

"06 20, 2020",Very solid and good value,Plenty of space large cargo for its class. The new shape is improved than the old shape better handling and excellent safety features. Also the seats are more comfortable. The only thing a little noisy but great value
"06 19, 2020",EFFECIENT AND RELIABLE CAR,"THIS CAR PROVIDES OUR FAMILY COMFORT NEEDS IN TRAVELLING AND DRIVING EXPERIENCE. WITH ITS NAVIGATION SCREEN, USB PORTS, PROVISION OF AIR CONDITION OUTLET AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AND ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF THE AIR CONDITION AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE . THE KEY LESS FEATURES PROVIDES EASY ACCESS, SAFETY ,COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE WHILE LOADING AND UNLOADING ITEMS."
"06 17, 2020",ALL-TIME FAVORITE CAR BY FAR....,This car is awesome. I was able to get a steal because of COVID pricing which made it all the more worth wile. I test drove 6 different SUV's prior to this buy. I'm so glad I chose the RAV. I truly enjoy driving this car. It's so smart. Everything is taken care of with lane assist and dynamic cruise control. I have AWD and its made it through 2 feet of water and up to the mountains for skiing with no problem. This car is so comfortable. We love taking road trips. I honestly have never had a car that I look forward to driving everyday. I feel like I'm 16 and I'm not kidding. When people get in they complement the car. When I pull up they compliment the car. It was a win win at 0% Financing. Toyota also gives way over ask for your trade in. Check them out. It's worth it.
"06 16, 2020",Very reliable,"This car met all my needs , practical, spacious, a lot  of new features .  I Just been driving for a week maybe i just not used to slow pickup on transmission. But over i think its reluable"
"06 14, 2020",From 2005 Highlander to 2020 RAV4. Xle,Love our new RAV4.  Not quite as quiet as our previous highlander.  But it’s just fine.   Plenty of interior room.  Like all the technology options.  Would highly recommend.
"06 14, 2020",Most reliable cars made,"More interior room than our previous 2017. Flatter nose, and excellent pick up. More comfortable seating. Programming is easy. Will always count on Toyota durability. And their re-sale value"
"06 13, 2020",A new vehicle to drive,"The brand new vehicle is already a pleasure to drive.  Some of the new features will take some getting used to, but I will get the hang of it eventually."
"06 10, 2020",I love the car but Im not happy with the service,"I love the car

"05 16, 2020",Car had all of the new safety features we desired.,"Car has met our needs.  We have owned our RAV4 for less than a month, so we are still getting used to its drive ability.  Like the light grey color match for both interior and exterior.  Owners manual is generic and seems full of warnings rather than a quick guide to perform settings, and all features mentioned (if equipped) may or may not  be included on our car."
"05 13, 2020",Wonderful 2020 Toyota RAV4,"This is our first RAV4, and we love it so far. The ride is so smooth, the look of the car inside and out is very classy. The spacing inside is very nice.

"03 13, 2020",I expect it to last just like my other Yotes.,"I opted for the XLE AWD trim for driving to trailheads when I go hiking. It is a feature packed car for the money. The tech is amazing. 

It reads road signs

It centers you on the lane, automatically following gentle curves on the highway and gently assists you if it thinks you're drifting

Turns headlights on and off, turns high beams on when there is no oncoming traffic

Can use cruise controls in stop and go traffic and turns the engine off if you're stopped waiting for lights to change.

Blindspot monitor

Alerts you if traffic is coming while you're backing up.

All LED head and tail lights means they will almost never burn out for the life of the car.

Different AWD software profiles for different surfaces.

Comes with Toyota's version of Onstar and Apple and Android interfaces.

It also has plenty of room for my gear and just the right size for a good balance of fuel economy and easy handling.

Other features I like:

Dual zone  and rear passengers AC, USB /power ports in the rear passenger and cargo areas.

Cargo cover

Factory tint

Factory rails and crossbars

And of course it is a Toyota. Might not be exciting to drive but it will soldier on for a decade or two!

The only thing I don't like is the throttle response from a stop in anything but Sport mode. So I just keep it in Sport mode!"
"03  8, 2020",Super comfortable,"Great car, easy to drive and very comfortable. Looks great too. Lots of excellent safety features. I love the ride in a Toyota. Holds the road great!"

"03  3, 2020",Great Car!!,My new RAV4 runs great and is well equipped in addition to being roomy.  It has all the whistles and bells one needs.  I believe I made a good choice and am very happy with my selection.
"02 28, 2020",Awesome car to own.,I have owned a RAV4 since 2005 and will continue to buy them. It’s just what i need. The design is nice for this year more technology great automobile.
"02 26, 2020",Not a winner,"I test drove 7 SUVs while researching for a purchase.  Before I did my first test drive I thought the I'd be buying a RAV4.  After my drive of the RAV4 though I wouldn't even put it in the top 4.  The performance of the car is pretty good but the ride is very stiff and uncomfortable.  The car has a full array of safety features but their usability leaves something to be wanted.  I don't think the exterior styling is as good as the Mazda CX-5, the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape or even the Chevy Equinox.  The interior is fairly well designed and executed but not on the same level as the Forester."
"02 26, 2020",Fits my family of 4 and room for my dog.,"This is all the room I need! I wanted a car that was good on gas, awd and very roomy. My kids and dogs have planty more space, I use to have a Hyundai elantra."
"02 25, 2020",My first Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD,"I had a Nissan Maxima for 10 years and the time came to start looking for a new car. The vehicles that I test drove were Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Nissan Rogue ,  VW Tiguan and Toyota Rav 4. With the help of  Abdul Onisemoh  (Salesman at Northside Toyota, 6042 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL 60659) I decided on the Rav 4.
I made the best decision, and I give this car a 4+ out of 5 stars."
"02 25, 2020",Toyota RAV4 I am driving in Highway very  good,I think it is very good and also it is very good on the highway. The design of the car is amazing I love it.
"02 21, 2020",New purchase,"This is my first time owning a Toyota vehicle. I have had the RAV 4 for 2 days now. I enjoy how it handles, the safety features, and all the extras that come standard with the base model. I am hoping to have this SUV for many years to come!"
"02 20, 2020",Great car,"All the fit and finish Toyota is know for and some pleasant surprises that the car has. Ride is great and the interior is really nice. The engine is weak, however, I feel it is better to have mpg vs speedy acceleration."
"02 19, 2020",RAV4 XLE Permium,"Just got this car and i am loving it. Drive is smooth, power acceleration is good. ECO and Sport modes save on gas and get you moving. I love the comfort and all of the options."
"02 16, 2020",Very stylish,I like the all wheel drive and the comfort of the interior -plenty of room for the grandkids and dog.  We feel very safe driving this auto.
"02 15, 2020",Uncomfortable seating. Very noisy!,Very uncomfortable seating. I can’t imagine how it would be after a long ride. Very noisy. You have to put the radio on loud to drown out the noise.  Not many features are standard as they are on other SUV’s.  Don’t recommend it.
"02 12, 2020",My First Brand New Car Purchase for a Reason,"I've been on the market for a new vehicle for about 6 months.  I decided on the 2020 Rav4 XLE AWD because it is the total package.  There is nothing that has been overlooked regarding comfort, drive ability, safety rating, and visual aesthetic.  It is the best value for the money.  I'm a Toyota customer for life!"
"02 10, 2020",RUBY FLARE RED RAV4 LIMITED,We replaced our prior RAV4 with this vehicle due to the high safety standards and overall reliability of Toyota. Lots of bells and whistles but also driver can decide which to use and which not to use. Navigation is great.
"02  5, 2020",Very sporty looking the color is what got our atte,"We had been looking to purchase a rav4 for some time but other dealers didn't have the color in stock.
Finally we walk into Red mccombs and sure enough it was on the show room floor.."
"02  2, 2020","Only had it for two months,comfortable smooth ride","Car is great,wish it had a few features like my previous PriusV , a cup
holder for the front passenger on far right of dash, two glove boxes,
better navigation system, not this new Car Play,especially when I do not
own an I Phone. Front dash instrument pannel on Prius V is the best ever built , regardless of make of vehicle ,should be in all makes.Put
it in the RAV4"
"02  2, 2020",Don’t know if it’s a reliable car,It’s beautiful and I been driving Toyota’s for over 24 years. Never had an issue. Very good vehicles.  The RAV4 I can’t say because as I was drinking out of the sales lot the check engine light turns on.   I had to leave my brand new vehicle so it can be look into.  So sad.  Brand new and can’t drive it.
"01 30, 2020",The best car I have owned!,"This is the best car I test drove. It had more features than I expected.
It's easy to drive and comfortable and has good gas mileage.  I drove several before choosing this one."
"01 29, 2020",I own 2020 xle plug weather parget,"Pick up slow, engine a little noise, wind noise, uncomfortable with the seat too hard, Apple carplay too similar. The things I love is vehicle outside the body, interior design have some space to put the phone, coins and more, also I love the 6 different choice for the driver: Eco, Normal, Sports, Snow, Dust sand and Rock.. Love it. For my experience this vehicle suitable for the driver who loves and enjoy to drive not for racing...."
"01 20, 2020",The smoothest and most beautiful car I ever owned,This car has everything that I wanted in a car. It has more room than my previous vehicle. The car is an AWD which I love and it goes through snow like butter.
"01 19, 2020",Decent car,To slow when taking off. Its feel like it hold back. Takes a while to catch speed. Try sport n its a bot better but still laggs
"01 19, 2020",Very safe car.,I owned a RAV4 and was very satisfied but there were a few things that I was wanting to update.  My dar was 5 years old.  My new RAV4 has all the improvements that I was wanting.  Love it!
"01 14, 2020",El mas confiable que he tenido,"Este carro es el mejor que he tenido, es muy espacioso, brinda seguridad y confort, tiene 3 puertos Usb y sensores que hacen que manejes con mas seguridad."
"01  7, 2020",My family owns several different Toyota vehicle,My Rav4 2020 is a bigger feel than most smaller SUV's. Lots of extras with out the cost of most luxury cars. Lots of room!
"01  7, 2020",Toyota never disappoints!,"The 2020 Toyota Rav4 XLE is top notch! I love the increased interior space, all the new safety features (especially BSM), and the overall performance of my vehicle. I chose the white exterior, tan interior and she is a beauty! I have had several Toyotas in the past (Camry, Avalon, Rav4) and I am always pleased with the superb quality of vehicles that Toyota brings."
"01  7, 2020","Love, love my new Toyota!","I’ve wanted a Toyota for a long time . I knew when I drove it that This was the car for me ! It drives great, I’m short  and this car sits me up so that I see all areas ! This is an awesome car!"
"01  6, 2020",I love this 2020 Toyota rav4 xle,"I love this 2020 Toyota RAV4 Xle, come equip with apple car play and Android auto, run really smooth, I wish post how has mileage, my car 207 miles been at Norwalk Toyota for rattling noise and they misdiagnosed my concern"
"01  4, 2020",I knew it would be a great choice,"I went from a Prius to a RAV4. I knew I would stay with Toyota because they have always been reliable and can go hundreds of thousands of miles with little maintenance. I got the RAV4 XLE Premium because I wanted an SUV so that I would sit higher up and not scrape curbs. I also wanted leather seats. As a bonus it also has a sunroof, 19 inch wheels and tons of great safety features that make me feel very secure. I love my car and feel like it has great value for the price."
"01  3, 2020",Had one week and in the shop for repairs!,"I owned a 2017 Toyota 4Runner and I loved it! Traded it in recently for a more gas efficient RAV4. Exactly one week later in less than 500 miles on the odometer and it is in the shop. They told me it needs a new catalytic converter. It has been in the shop for over a week now!
This car is a comfortable ride however very uncomfortable to get in and out of for me anyway. The large screen blocks some view out the front window and light switches and such are difficult to locate in the dark. Just not easily accessible and very disappointed in this car overall. I bought the XLE version and the interior is not to my liking. Also Toyota is now do not come standard with floor mats. I think this is ridiculous! Brand new car should come with floor mats for goodness sakes!"
"01  3, 2020",The absolute best car I’ve ever owned,"Very spacious......very comfortable seats....smooth ride. If my hands were not on the steering wheel, I would probably think I’m in an airplane... awesome audio...beautiful blue color... an absolute joy.."
"01  3, 2020",Great vehicle,"The safety features are great, plenty of leg room, drives great and rides even better. Has emergency button to push for help, which is awesome when you have health issues."
"01  3, 2020",Great car,"The car looks great, runs great and I love all the safety features.  I would definitely recommend this suv.  I am beyond satisfied with my new vehicle."
"01  2, 2020",New 2020 Rav 4,"I turned in my 2017 Rav and found the 2020 to be totally redesigned. Its comfortable and better on gas. It's to early to tell what I really feel about it, but so far it's been great."
"01  2, 2020",Logical Car buying,This car is the first investment that I was proud to make. The resale value and quality of this car is top notch. It gets great gas mileage and has so many new features. I love the cruise control with steering assist. Complete game changer.
"01  1, 2020",Love the Toyota Rav 4,"This car has had many improvements since 2015! It has many more safety features, more comfort and is smarter than I am! Reading reviews of a car is one thing in that it is subjective. The 2020 Rav 4 is a dream!"
"01  1, 2020",Love it,"This car is perfect for Florida with safety features, gas mileage, comfort, technology, eco settings. I love the lunar rock color and new frame. Looks sleek"
"01  1, 2020",I love this car!,I bought it for both personal and work use. I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is a goat! Climbs anything! It is comfortable and the gas mileage is great!
"12 29, 2019",Exactly what I was looking for in a new car!,"This car has every feature I wanted in a new car! Best car I have ever owned! Style, comfort, and performance are at the top of my list. I will own Toyota as along as I live! Very satisfied!"
"12 27, 2019",The auto breaking is an issue.,"Test drive did not charge the non hybrids car battery enough to experience the auto breaking so wasn’t till I already owned that i discovered when the auto breaking/ engine cut off and restart releases it’s jarring enough to think I’ve been rear ended.  Good thing no one was behind me I would have never guessed Toyota would release a technology this poorly designed and would have accused them of rear ending me.      Yes i can turn it off each time I start the car,  but I should not have to and of course that factors into the gas savings.  I gave up a hybrid sonata that was smooth as silk transitioning but silly me wanted to go back to Toyota."
"12 21, 2019",Great ride and love safety features.,It is a vehicle I will use every day and in inclement weather so wanted depedable AWD vehicle that will last. Also wanted the extra safety features for my daughter who is a new driver.
"12 20, 2019",Toyota Universe,I was so pleased with the great customer service and good pricing. Please do meet Koshy Thomas who was great! He helped me with my first big purchase of buying my new Toyota Rav 4. You have to visit the Toyota Universe dealership in Little Falls!
"12 18, 2019",This will be my 5th Rav4,"I love the exterior look and color of the new 2020 RAV4 I’ve never have had a car that was a color, always silver, gray or taupe."
"12 16, 2019",Beautiful and Spacious,"It was a good deal and I love the car. My buying experience with my salesman Chris Keene was awesome, a very nice young man!!"
"12 10, 2019",Toyota is number one,Nothing I got everything in it I need I still don't need any thing to add to it everything is good to me you make more colors
"12  6, 2019",I prefer Toyota’s for a good reason,"This car is perfect for us. The leather seats with lumbar support on the driver’s side are very comfortable. I am short so it is great that I can pump the seat up for better visibility. The navigation screen is at eye level. This is a first for us. It is great to not have to take your eyes off of the road. The extra USB ports are wonderful. The cabin is very quiet on the road, the only exception is when you have to accelerate to merge, but acceleration doesn’t take long. I love the automatic lift gate. It is so convenient when shopping."
"11 22, 2019",Totally amazing sporty SUV Toyota 2020 XSE Hybrid,I love it The new 2020 XSE hybrid is very stylish looking excellent fuel economy about 48 on the freeway it has a 8 inch touch screen it reminds me of my I pad built in lots of room in the cabin with 4 drive modes . One of the cool things about this car is if you ever valet your car or give it to a kid or family member to borrow you can set up the parameters of the speed they’re going the miles the distance you can actually watch where the car is from your phone. Plus you can Drop the car off valet parking and we all know how they like to hot Rod peoples cars and take him on joyrides I can now set how fast that car will go and how many miles are allowed to drive it it all comes with the advanced tech package With car . Plus I can start the car anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi or the Internet and I can lock and unlock the doors if I want. There is 0 rode noise on this car . Last thing there over 3 k in profit don’t pay more than 36k for this car . My Favorite color is the blue print flame catch up
"11 21, 2019","Love all the safety features, especially RCTA",I like the rav as this is my second one. The safety features are great. Trunk area is good and also the rubber mats inside. Ride is good.
"11 19, 2019",Love it!,"Love it! Great car, comfortable, nice and easy to drive. It has great safety futures as well great convenience package.  Definitely would recommend to friends and family."
"11  5, 2019",More Than I Expected,"Soon after purchase I have taken the TRD Off Road model over 100 miles of gravel, dirt and rocky roads and climbed over 15,000 of elevation on two different trips. Tight steering radius made hairpin switchbacks easy and those short steep inclines were not noticed with the stock Falken Wildpeak AT tires and the setting Normal ""Rock and Sand"". Great gas mileage driving all the time in the Sport Mode when not off road. Spacious and comfortable inside. Great car Toyota !!!"
"10 13, 2019",2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited Review,"Perennially a best-selling SUV, the RAV4 can be had in a wide range of iterations, so it’s no wonder it’s so popular. Price-Leader LE models are pretty basic, but an available hybrid Powertrain Control is compelling. High-end Limited models can challenge the Lexus NX with their many luxury features and a new TRD off-road model promises enhanced capacity as they hit the trails. Its robust styling makes it look right at home with the Toyota 4Runner SUV and Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. Driving dynamics tend toward the mundane side of the spectrum, but most consumers will find the 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid’s ride comfortable and its handling comfortable. Adult passengers will also be pleased with Toyota’s generous legroom in both front and rear seats; Cargo Room is also competitive with the best in the segment.

2020 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID LIMITED REVIEW
Toyota introduces the TRD off-road model for 2020, which comes with unique 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a TRD off-road suspension kit with red Coil springs, and lots of TRD logos ear tags interior and exterior. Elsewhere in the lineup, Android Auto capability becomes a standard feature as does SiriusXM satellite radio; The XLE models now come with a Power-adjustable driver’s seat, but lose the standard moonroof, which becomes part of the optional convenience package. The mid-range Adventure model gets a leather wrapped steering wheel and Shift knob, but the Power Lift Gate model is now optional. Limited trims now come with the premium JBL sound system as standard.

"05 18, 2024",bought this vehicle new.,"bought this vehicle new. in & out for repairs....parts keep breaking or burning out. last repair $1700, electric break control issue. defective part.
prior another defective part $825...this one I argued with Toyota & got them to reimburse me. 
always had honda/ acuras. never any major problems over 20 years."
"10 29, 2023",Very happy with my purchase,After purchase I immediately took the car on an 800 mile road trip. It is much more comfortable and rides more smoothly than our older RAV4 and had plenty of pep for highway driving. Averaged over 37 MPG at highway speed of 70-80 MPH. Would have liked a power hatchback but overall I’m very satisfied with the options that came with it as an LE model.
"10 22, 2023",Not worth the money.,I bought a 2020 Rav 4 it has been in the shop more then anything. Always some with voltage and power steering.  Computer updates. I have sank more money into repairs then anything else. Not reliable or dependable for what I paid for the vehicle.
"10  9, 2023",toyota get in the game,no matter how basic a car the ability to open your garage door should be standard.  rav4 LE strips too many basic needs.  toyota stop being cheap get in the game
"06  9, 2023",Going Places,"Definition of practical while being affordable. All the bad reviews are because the geniuses who purchases them did no research. Auto Off engine kills your battery life, leaving it off is perfect. Packed with safety features, you want your kids in this car 100%. 28 mpg in the city and 35+ in 55 MPH zones. I get 38 mpg highway normally. Sure you can pay $35k+ for a hybrid, but this is well engineered already."
"05 24, 2023",Rav 4 2020,"2020 rav4 engine maintenance and they say is valve..$600 that is crazy..

Do not buy rav4 they say all rav 4 have this issue but it is not a recall.."
"02 11, 2023",Rav4 Battery dead at 2.5 years,"Car would not start at 25500 miles and 2.5 years.   Battery completely dead.  Trying to get battery recharged.  We drive car regularly, so there is NO reason for battery to be dead. 
Horrible situation to find car want start after only 2.5 years.
Checking on a used Honda."
"12 17, 2022",Highly Recommend,"We just bought a 2020 Rav4 LE as a Toyota Certified car with 21,500 miles.  We downsized (literally) from a 20 year old Sequoia, so we're getting accustomed to the smaller size.  My only complaint is that the cup holders seem to be a bit awkward.  I love the design and the all of the safety features and the handling while driving."
"11 14, 2022",Re: Rav 4 purchase,"I had a great experience when purchasing my new car. The says rep at Toyota of Lincoln Park, Edgar Rivera was extremely knowledgeable and professional."
"09 27, 2022",a little bit expensive but worthy,only concern I have is the tire pressure sensor(s) are a little bit sensitive.  This including the spare tire carried its own sensor. You only used spare tire once a while not daily.  quality is good. no CVT transmission problems for Adventure model. The 4 wheels drive for adventure is amazing drove in heavy rain Floody conditions without a scratch (which Forester and CRV were parking on roadside cannot move)
"09  8, 2022",Not as good as U think,Rough suspension and way too much road noise. Getting in and out will be more difficult for tall or long legged people as you sit very low even with drivers seat elevated. Radio is probably the best part of this vehicle as it has lots of tunable settings and good volume for those who like it loud. Windows fog up bad and take too long to clear when parked. Does not heat up fast like a V-8 does. Gas mileage is about half what is advertised and that is not good. Overall I couldn't get to a good review on this. 3.5/5 at best.
"09  2, 2022",Viva de milagro.,"RAVA 4 2020…frenos fallaron y aceleró grandemente. Se llenó de humo blanco…
Paramos en una cuneta en construcción perdida total… vivos de milagro.
15 meses de uso. TERRIBLE!!!"
"04 25, 2022",Love our Rav!!,"Virtually nothing has gone wrong with my 2020 RAV4. I have a small bit of buyer remorse, because wear hearing aids and there is a lot of road noise in my Rav. The Venza model turns out to be more luxurious and is much quieter. But, it has trade offs, as well. I might have gone with that, had I known. But the Rav is a great vehicle, no actual regrets. Lots of power when one needs it. And the breaking system kept me out of an accident, several months ago, the brakes went on when someone pulled out in front of me from a side road. I was not looking in that direction, and never would have braked soon enough. We recently went on a road trip from Washington state to Southern California and we’re delighted when we got 42 MPG. Great car, no regrets, maybe I’ll take it somewhere for some soundproofing."
"04  8, 2022","Old is gold, very reliable","I inherited this car from my grandmother, she bought it new in 2000 and barely ever drove it, so it was in great condition when I ended up getting it back in 2014. I've put about 50,000 miles on it between work, high school, and college. I love this little car, it's never given me an issue and is more reliable than some of my friends' cars from 2010 or newer. The interior leaves a bit to be desired; it's comfortable but the design of the dashboard isn't great and the cupholders are basically useless and get in the way of the gear changer. Well, back in y2k drinks weren't as big as they are now so I can hardly blame them, but it does still suck when I go to put my car in park and the stick won't even go all the way forward because my water bottle is blocking it. The paint coat was excellent and has only just recently (about 2019ish) began to oxidize and peel its topcoat. The SUV style isn't for everyone, but I like roomy, boxy cars like this one. One thing I REALLY appreciate is how quickly the AC and heating kick in. Being from south California, I need the AC to come on as quickly as possible in the hot summer, and my RAV4 is cooled down by the time I leave my driveway. This car has 129,000 miles on it, and I think I can take it for another 80,000 at least. It doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of a newer car with heated seats and electric door locks, but for its time it is more than a wonderful car, and I'll be sticking with Toyota for my next car as well."
"04  2, 2022",It was not a new car it had 300 hundred miles and,I traded 2 cars for this Rava 4 had 300.00 miles and they sold it to me for a New Car but it was not a new car with that many miles I will not buy another Toyota SUV from Sparks Toyota At Myrtle beach I was sick and I tole them I did not feel like messing with it but they pressure me in getting and I told them over and over that I did not feel like trading and they kept on and on they just done me wrong they should pay me for putting me thru all that stuff it was not right so what can I do about that let me know something thank
"03 24, 2021",A reliable car that's made very well,"I enjoy the car, going on long trips to Connecticut to visit my grandchildren never have to worry, I have told my friends about the RAV4 and two of them have bought it and are very happy"
"03 23, 2021",most reliable car I've owned,"This is the second Toyota I have owned. the first one being a 1989 Camry. it was my favorite car I have owned until now. I love Toyotas. they are reliable and comfortable. this car is no different, with the added bonus of being modern and having all the cool technology. I don't know how I lived with out Apple Car Play, before now. its a game changer. the seats in my  2020 XLE are what sold me. they are cloth and super comfortable. there is space for our family of four, without feeling like I am driving a bus. This SUV is perfect for us!"
"02 23, 2021",Smartphone,This car Quality is very good and this is a nice car. I love this car. Anyone can buy it at an affordable price. Thank you for sharing with us.
"02  4, 2021","Very Comfortable, smooth ride, and rekuable",I like sitting up higher and having a better view of the rode. It has comfortable seating and an easy to manage control panel. It is economical in terms of gas and oil
"01 31, 2021",I'm always be happy to have a Toyota as my car,"For me , Toyota is  the most best of the cars everyone should have for their family.  it's an economic car ,  it saves fuel  and it's a fighter vehicle."
"01 30, 2021",Best AWD SUV!,"Comfortable, best handling in the elements, Toyota reliability, all the features, great gas mileage, large trunk space. Only drawback to the XLE model is no sunroof and no power lift gate."
"01 24, 2021",Best Toyota so far,I absolutely love this car. I basically traded in my Toyotas every three years and I’ve had just about every model and this RAV4 is the most unbelievable car I’ve had I love it and definitely will get another one
"01  2, 2021",Least reliable car I have ever owned,"My 2020 Rav4 Hybrid has three major issues since purchased in August 2020. One, stalling, remains unresolved despite several attempts of the dealer to find the cause. Apparently many others have the same issue.
Another, 12v battery discharge due to heavy demand from various options, causes voltage levels to drop below that needed to start the car. A software fix and my taking initiative to deselect options such as automatic parking reduced demand on the battery. But the less-tna-full-size battery is an issue.  
A third issue, issues related to filling and pumping fuel from a redesigned gas tank, caused a lot of anxiety but has apparently been fixed.
Toyota's response has been less than I would expect given the widespread occurance of these issues.  Buyers were NOT advise of these issue when purchasing. Dealers service dept often expressed lack of awareness of the issues.
I do NOT recommend this car."
"12 30, 2020",Tbis was an Awesome purchase for my family,"This car is perfect for my family, we're enjoying the performance and room of the car. We took a trip a the ride was wonderful."
"12 22, 2020",Just bought it  So far I am happy but Give me time,"So Far I like it very much,  it is responsive. But since I have driven it for only 2 days i need l little more time to evaluate"
"12 18, 2020",Toyota RAV4,"This vehicle is really superb. It’s everything you need in a car. Hoping this last just like my Toyota Camry 06 model which I drove for 305,000 miles."
"12 16, 2020",issued,"paint not good and .
i wont buy toyota again the dealers when you come back them treat you very bad i will try next time another brand"
"12 15, 2020",I purchased a 2020 Rav 4 in February 2020 -,I've had nothing but problems out of this vehicle.  My dealership has replaced the battery 2 times - Spring and Winter 2020 - because something in this vehicle keeps depleting the battery.
"12  9, 2020",Fifth RAV4,"This is our 6th RAV 4 since 2009 under the lease program, not that previous RAVs have had issues but it's nice to drive a new car every few years and not have to worry about maintenance."
"11 29, 2020",RAV4 is a very comfortable easy to use vehicle tha,Vehicle had all the options that we could Asfoor to keep our daughter safe and with Toyota dependability and value what else can I say
"11 14, 2020",Love my car!,"My last car was a Nissan Sentra (never again Nissan). Last winter it got stuck in a quarter inch of snow on the tiniest incline in a parking lot. That’s when I knew I needed an SUV. Toyotas have always been reliable cars to me, and the new style of the RAV4 caught my eye, and I just knew I needed this car. Got a white XLE with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats and steering wheel, moonroof, premium sound system, power everything, push button start, etc. I love how it drives, super smooth and powerful for a 4-cylinder! I average about 28 miles to the gallon, and the Toyota Connect package is awesome! I can lock/unlock my doors, start my car remotely, and check the status of my car through the app! So cool! Also offers Wifi hotspot which has been good for my kids going on their virtual classrooms as we drive. Can’t wait to see what it can do in snow!"
"10 23, 2020",xxx Not good,"Never buy Toyota 
Should have gone with another manufacturer as nothing but problems which have not been repaired and not taken seriously by dealership as of now"
"10 21, 2020",Best Purchase!,"I am absolutely obsessed with my new Rav4! I previously owned a 2007 model and new when it was time to upgrade, I was going to stick with another Rav. The 2020 model is the best purchase I could have made, I am extremely thrilled and excited about it. Performance and reliability are so far a 100% in my book! I was at first apprehensive about the tire not being on the back any longer, as to me - that's what made the Rav stand out, but with the 2020, I love the new look of the body."
"10 21, 2020",Most comfortable vehicle I own,"This vehicle meets all my needs. The cabin is roomy with ample leg room. This by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned for long road trips. The blind spot monitor, back up camera and pre-collision system make this vehicle a truly safe, comfortable ride."
"10 20, 2020",2020 RAV4 Limited AWD,"We have driven a 2007 RAV4 limited AWD for almost 14 years.  It has been virtually trouble free so it was a no brainer to get the same car for the CEO (wife).  Have only driven it for a few hundred miles but the following stand out so far...

1.  Seating comfort is very good.
2.  The A/C makes it cold enough to hang meat inside the car.
3.  Pretty sporty looking for an SUV.
4.  So much info on the dash it will take some time to learn all of the functions.
5.  The addition of a trailer hitch for the bike rack virtually disables the ""Kick sensor"" for closing the back hatch.

Because of the short time of ownership, I cannot speak on the longevity or reliability of the car.   So far, so good and time will tell if this lives up to the reliability of our 2007 RAV4.  This survey makes you put in a rating for reliability"
"10 20, 2020",I love my suv,I'm greatly satisfied with my SUV. My salesman was very professional and showed me all about my new suv. I couldn't be more satisfied with it
"10 20, 2020",Best vehicle  I  have  every  owned.,"It's  beautiful  inside, lots of room. Safety  features  amazed me for the price I paid. All the features are easy to set. The ignition is  a little tricky  for me but I  am sure I  will adjust."
"10  8, 2020","Great Car, Last Toyota I will ever buy","Great Cars, Terrible People, dealer made buying a car worst than going to Dentist. Dealers sales Manager tried to chest bump me,A real Bully
Salesman turned out to be coward and disappeared"
"10  5, 2020",Lots of safety options in entry level car,We bought a new RAV4 for our oldest daughter and feel it’s the perfect car for her and our family. Not too small not too big and has a lot of safety features which will help a young driver. Toyotas are safe and dependable cars!

Comfortable enough for an 8 hour drive on   highway,  crossing from state to state.   Good cruise control, as well as good navigation features and ease of audio use.   Room in the cargo  area for my golf bag and weekend bag."
"09 30, 2020","heard and read, now own","This car has plenty of leg room in the  front and esp in the back.  We were looking for a bigger space in the back for a medium dog cage to fit. The ride is quiet and the phone sounds nice thru blue tooth. Im not a music fan so anything will do, but the music sounds great with the system. I love the thick car matts that came with the vehicle and looking forward to testing out all the options."
"09 30, 2020",Feel safe in my vehicle,"This meets all my needs and has more features than I was looking for, but ones that I  very much enjoy. I am a happy person driving my RAV4."

"09 23, 2020",It's an upgrade to me,"Went from a 2018 to the 2020 model and I like it. I'm not a big car guy so the feature really don't mean anything to me, but from what my gearheads friends have told me it was a smart buy."

"09 10, 2020",This car rides wonderfully and has plenty of power,I really like the lane warnings and lane correction.  It is awesome to send and receive texts from the screen.  It is super comfortable and quiet.
"09 10, 2020",Really good suv,It performs very well overall with some minor setbacks. Under heavy rai the blind spot sensors might not detect an approaching vehicle. Same goes for the lane departure warning system. Other than that great ride.
"09  5, 2020",Fun car,This car met all our needs. Affordable and reliable without giving up all the bells and whistles! Plenty of room for two teenage boys in the back seat and all their stuff!
"08 31, 2020",I like this car,"After driving the Camry was by far the best . It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology."
"08 30, 2020",Favorite Car so far,"I love this car to death! I can’t ask for more. All the Amenities are there. Love the Navigation system and very friendly , welcoming you in every State you go. The drive is awesome , spacious and most of all EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURES. I feel very safe. ❤️👍"

"08 29, 2020",It's my fourth RAV 4.,"This is my fourth RAV 4.  It meets all my needs.  It is not a monster truck, it is just right.  It drives like a car."
"08 23, 2020",Regret buying a rav4,"I regret buying a rav4.  The vehicle has had a persistent rattle coming from the steering column and the dealer was unable to fix the problem.  In addition, the Bluetooth connection to an iPhone is unreliable.  Toyotas cost more than their competitors which is fine if you get superior quality but that’s not what I’m getting.  Buy a Honda instead."
"08 15, 2020",Toyota,"The car met my needs. Sporty. Like the way it drives. I am downsizing, but still enough room in the backseats. Lots of storage in the back"
"08 12, 2020",Reliable,Met my needs for driving both locally and highway.  Car has nice looks and feel.  I don't have any more comments to make  Simple car simple review
"08 12, 2020",Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,"My only concern is that I didn’t buy one sooner! It has so much room, fantastic on gas mileage and all the standard features are great."
"08 11, 2020",So far I'm very pleased!,My Rav 4 has met all my expectations since switching over from owning a Honda for many years. I have now chosen Toyota for reliability!
"08 10, 2020",I will continue tobuy this car because it reliable,This vehicle supports all of my needs. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this vehicle again when I want to trade in my leased vehicle. Larry H Miller dealership in Colorado Springs is my new favorite dealership for toyota vehicles.
"08  8, 2020",Fits like a glove feeling,"The only thing I wish would be a better take off from 0 mph to 60 mph.
The car is amazingly economical, despite its high center of gravity it does not lean at turns and behaves like a low seating Honda Accord.
It remains economical even when I I pull open trailer with the garden tractor on it!"
"08  7, 2020",Quality Vehicle,"The vehicle that I purchase exceeds all of my needs that I need to commute.  Comfortable ride, quiet and enough room to spare for passengers and cargo."
"08  6, 2020",Great car,Just purchased and already love it. So many high end features that are standard on this vehicle. You cannot beat a Toyota for value and performance!
"08  3, 2020",I feel safe in this SUV.,This SUV is well built. It is very spacious. I feel safe having my son in it  this SUV. I really like the color and the ability to be able to connect my phone to the vehicle.
"08  3, 2020",Still getting used to it.,"Although bought in February, I'm still trying to get used to certain new things that weren't on the 2014 RAV 4.  Such as the gas tank opener, which a friend had to find for me.  It's right next to the hood opener."
"08  1, 2020",Most reliable car I’ve ever purchased,"I am a very picky car shopper, I absolutely love this car I do not have any thing negative to report  . Fun to drive easy to use .  I love this rav 4"
"07 31, 2020",First new car,Love the vehicle.its smooth dependable and easy to drive with Bluetooth option because I do homecare and drive a lot! And wanted to get back into 4 wheel drive.
"07 31, 2020",I never owned a new car before,I wanted a RAV4 for several years now and I am very happy with my purchase and proud to own it. I’ve gotten May compliments on the car especially the color
"07 30, 2020",it is the perfect vehicle for me and my family,I really like this vehicle especially the new updated body type and its very comfortable interior as well. The size is perfect for me and my family.
"07 28, 2020",The 2020 RAV4 Does not Disappoint,"This SUV is spacious, drives well on both city streets, highways and dirt roads. The technology features are great and it’s not bad on gas at all! It’s not meant for anyone over 6’4” and stocky build like my husband.. But it’s a perfect fit for me! LOVE this ride!"
"07 27, 2020",RAV4 Hybrid Limited - Best RAV4 Ever,"This is my 4th RAV4 so obviously I am a fan. The hybrid has more power, more low end torque, and is just the most fun to drive of them all. Got all the bells and whistles and am enjoying the fun parts, but also appreciating the additional safety features. Thought the panoramic camera view would be just a toy but it is very useful for parking in tight places and not running over the dog. This model of RAV4 is a little longer and a little wider -- lots of room inside for the grandkid's car seats."
"07 26, 2020",Haven’t had a new car in 11 years,"This car was rated in the top 5 by Blue Book. I read several reviews before even test driving it. Performance is great, high tech and stylish. But three adults can’t fit comfortably which in the back seat, which is sad. I really wish the XLE, AWD included in the conference package or weather package self start and something very simple as a net to keep groceries and other items from moving back and forth In the cargo area."
"07 26, 2020",A++++++ Rav4 great step up!,"The car meet all our needs. I love that it has 5 usb ports, has CarPlay, the shape in front is fierce looking and a lot of trunk space."
"07 24, 2020",Great car,love the speed that this car delivers. Great gas mileage. It is what I have been looking for in a hybrid Car. Rav4 Limited Red
"07 23, 2020",Dream Car,"This car as been at the top of my purchase list for over 10 years. I’m so excited to finally own this SUV. My main reason for purchasing this vehicle is for the AWD, the additional “snow”, “sand/dirt”, “rock” features are a bonus. I also love that Toyota now has standard safety features which puts my mind at ease. All the new 2020 vehicles come with Car play as well so no need to worry about being distracted while driving. The absolute “cherry on top” is the 2 year maintenance free that Toyota offers on all their new vehicles. I’m in love with my new Toyota RAV4!!"
"07 20, 2020",Best Car and Dealership,"I test drove this Rav4 LE from Romeoville Toyota. My salesman Michael was so awesome at answering all of my questions and letting me test drive this vehicle! He gave me information on everything I needed to know about the vehicle and made my experience amazing! I am so excited to go back to purchase and I will definitely be referring Romeoville Toyota and Michael to anyone looking for a new, reliable car!"
"07 18, 2020",Amazing new design,Beautiful new design  I have the adventure trim which can tow more than the base model and we look forward to using for camping and our bikes
"07  3, 2020",Very good for a small suv,Great gas Mil. and being a 2020 it has a lot of features that my 2017 did  have. The safety features  that you get with toyota make it worth looking at this brand.
"06 28, 2020",Shout Out to Easton Koons Toyota,"My 2nd vehicle from Easton Koons!  Gary and Brad worked hard to make sure I was totally satisfied and to get me in this Rav4!   Gotta give Easton Toyota a visit!  You won't be disappointed.  The service has always been good over the years  as well, just an all around good choice."
"06 27, 2020",I test drove the rav4 xle,It’s a pretty nice suv but there are so many packages it will dive you crazy! To get a good rave4 with bigger wheels you got to step up to a rav4 premium and then you get more stuff like adjustable seats Partial heated steering wheel but not everyone what’s all that stuff it can get very pricey for a rav4. I’m currently looking at a Mazda witch is like 5.000 to 7.000 cheaper then a rav4 depending on the packages you want to get .
"06 25, 2020",Great Vehicle. I love that it!,I love that it can pick up and go if I need it to. There are so many helpful options that I’m not quite used to yet. I know they will be easy to learn though. I love the comfort of the seats. The back seats are comfortable as well. So far I love everything.
"06 24, 2020",Very comfortable lots of leg room,The vehicle is very comfortable alot of safety features like the console it rides smooth and quiet.  Love that i can start it from my phone.

"06 22, 2020",simple the best value!,"Good looking,good price, fuel efficient and my family love it. It is simply the best value on the road. It’s size, it’s looks, gas mileage and dependability makes it the best Toyota model on the road."
"06 20, 2020",Very solid and good value,Plenty of space large cargo for its class. The new shape is improved than the old shape better handling and excellent safety features. Also the seats are more comfortable. The only thing a little noisy but great value
"06 19, 2020",EFFECIENT AND RELIABLE CAR,"THIS CAR PROVIDES OUR FAMILY COMFORT NEEDS IN TRAVELLING AND DRIVING EXPERIENCE. WITH ITS NAVIGATION SCREEN, USB PORTS, PROVISION OF AIR CONDITION OUTLET AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AND ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF THE AIR CONDITION AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE . THE KEY LESS FEATURES PROVIDES EASY ACCESS, SAFETY ,COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE WHILE LOADING AND UNLOADING ITEMS."
"06 17, 2020",ALL-TIME FAVORITE CAR BY FAR....,This car is awesome. I was able to get a steal because of COVID pricing which made it all the more worth wile. I test drove 6 different SUV's prior to this buy. I'm so glad I chose the RAV. I truly enjoy driving this car. It's so smart. Everything is taken care of with lane assist and dynamic cruise control. I have AWD and its made it through 2 feet of water and up to the mountains for skiing with no problem. This car is so comfortable. We love taking road trips. I honestly have never had a car that I look forward to driving everyday. I feel like I'm 16 and I'm not kidding. When people get in they complement the car. When I pull up they compliment the car. It was a win win at 0% Financing. Toyota also gives way over ask for your trade in. Check them out. It's worth it.
"06 16, 2020",Very reliable,"This car met all my needs , practical, spacious, a lot  of new features .  I Just been driving for a week maybe i just not used to slow pickup on transmission. But over i think its reluable"
"06 14, 2020",From 2005 Highlander to 2020 RAV4. Xle,Love our new RAV4.  Not quite as quiet as our previous highlander.  But it’s just fine.   Plenty of interior room.  Like all the technology options.  Would highly recommend.
"06 14, 2020",Most reliable cars made,"More interior room than our previous 2017. Flatter nose, and excellent pick up. More comfortable seating. Programming is easy. Will always count on Toyota durability. And their re-sale value"
"06 13, 2020",A new vehicle to drive,"The brand new vehicle is already a pleasure to drive.  Some of the new features will take some getting used to, but I will get the hang of it eventually."
"06 10, 2020",I love the car but Im not happy with the service,"I love the car

"05 16, 2020",Car had all of the new safety features we desired.,"Car has met our needs.  We have owned our RAV4 for less than a month, so we are still getting used to its drive ability.  Like the light grey color match for both interior and exterior.  Owners manual is generic and seems full of warnings rather than a quick guide to perform settings, and all features mentioned (if equipped) may or may not  be included on our car."
"05 13, 2020",Wonderful 2020 Toyota RAV4,"This is our first RAV4, and we love it so far. The ride is so smooth, the look of the car inside and out is very classy. The spacing inside is very nice.

 thought about what an owner needs to have an enjoyable driving experience.  The comfort level of this car is the best we have ever experienced."
"03 13, 2020",I expect it to last just like my other Yotes.,"I opted for the XLE AWD trim for driving to trailheads when I go hiking. It is a feature packed car for the money. The tech is amazing. 

It reads road signs

It centers you on the lane, automatically following gentle curves on the highway and gently assists you if it thinks you're drifting

Turns headlights on and off, turns high beams on when there is no oncoming traffic

Can use cruise controls in stop and go traffic and turns the engine off if you're stopped waiting for lights to change.

Blindspot monitor

Alerts you if traffic is coming while you're backing up.

All LED head and tail lights means they will almost never burn out for the life of the car.

Different AWD software profiles for different surfaces.

Comes with Toyota's version of Onstar and Apple and Android interfaces.

It also has plenty of room for my gear and just the right size for a good balance of fuel economy and easy handling.

Other features I like:

Dual zone  and rear passengers AC, USB /power ports in the rear passenger and cargo areas.

Cargo cover

Factory tint

Factory rails and crossbars

And of course it is a Toyota. Might not be exciting to drive but it will soldier on for a decade or two!

The only thing I don't like is the throttle response from a stop in anything but Sport mode. So I just keep it in Sport mode!"
"03  8, 2020",Super comfortable,"Great car, easy to drive and very comfortable. Looks great too. Lots of excellent safety features. I love the ride in a Toyota. Holds the road great!"

"03  3, 2020",Great Car!!,My new RAV4 runs great and is well equipped in addition to being roomy.  It has all the whistles and bells one needs.  I believe I made a good choice and am very happy with my selection.
"02 28, 2020",Awesome car to own.,I have owned a RAV4 since 2005 and will continue to buy them. It’s just what i need. The design is nice for this year more technology great automobile.
"02 26, 2020",Not a winner,"I test drove 7 SUVs while researching for a purchase.  Before I did my first test drive I thought the I'd be buying a RAV4.  After my drive of the RAV4 though I wouldn't even put it in the top 4.  The performance of the car is pretty good but the ride is very stiff and uncomfortable.  The car has a full array of safety features but their usability leaves something to be wanted.  I don't think the exterior styling is as good as the Mazda CX-5, the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape or even the Chevy Equinox.  The interior is fairly well designed and executed but not on the same level as the Forester."
"02 26, 2020",Fits my family of 4 and room for my dog.,"This is all the room I need! I wanted a car that was good on gas, awd and very roomy. My kids and dogs have planty more space, I use to have a Hyundai elantra."
"02 25, 2020",My first Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD,"I had a Nissan Maxima for 10 years and the time came to start looking for a new car. The vehicles that I test drove were Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Nissan Rogue ,  VW Tiguan and Toyota Rav 4. With the help of  Abdul Onisemoh  (Salesman at Northside Toyota, 6042 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL 60659) I decided on the Rav 4.
I made the best decision, and I give this car a 4+ out of 5 stars."
"02 25, 2020",Toyota RAV4 I am driving in Highway very  good,I think it is very good and also it is very good on the highway. The design of the car is amazing I love it.
"02 21, 2020",New purchase,"This is my first time owning a Toyota vehicle. I have had the RAV 4 for 2 days now. I enjoy how it handles, the safety features, and all the extras that come standard with the base model. I am hoping to have this SUV for many years to come!"
"02 20, 2020",Great car,"All the fit and finish Toyota is know for and some pleasant surprises that the car has. Ride is great and the interior is really nice. The engine is weak, however, I feel it is better to have mpg vs speedy acceleration."
"02 19, 2020",RAV4 XLE Permium,"Just got this car and i am loving it. Drive is smooth, power acceleration is good. ECO and Sport modes save on gas and get you moving. I love the comfort and all of the options."
"02 16, 2020",Very stylish,I like the all wheel drive and the comfort of the interior -plenty of room for the grandkids and dog.  We feel very safe driving this auto.
"02 15, 2020",Uncomfortable seating. Very noisy!,Very uncomfortable seating. I can’t imagine how it would be after a long ride. Very noisy. You have to put the radio on loud to drown out the noise.  Not many features are standard as they are on other SUV’s.  Don’t recommend it.
"02 12, 2020",My First Brand New Car Purchase for a Reason,"I've been on the market for a new vehicle for about 6 months.  I decided on the 2020 Rav4 XLE AWD because it is the total package.  There is nothing that has been overlooked regarding comfort, drive ability, safety rating, and visual aesthetic.  It is the best value for the money.  I'm a Toyota customer for life!"
"02 10, 2020",RUBY FLARE RED RAV4 LIMITED,We replaced our prior RAV4 with this vehicle due to the high safety standards and overall reliability of Toyota. Lots of bells and whistles but also driver can decide which to use and which not to use. Navigation is great.
"02  5, 2020",Very sporty looking the color is what got our atte,"We had been looking to purchase a rav4 for some time but other dealers didn't have the color in stock.
Finally we walk into Red mccombs and sure enough it was on the show room floor.."
"02  2, 2020","Only had it for two months,comfortable smooth ride","Car is great,wish it had a few features like my previous PriusV , a cup
holder for the front passenger on far right of dash, two glove boxes,
better navigation system, not this new Car Play,especially when I do not
own an I Phone. Front dash instrument pannel on Prius V is the best ever built , regardless of make of vehicle ,should be in all makes.Put
it in the RAV4"
"02  2, 2020",Don’t know if it’s a reliable car,It’s beautiful and I been driving Toyota’s for over 24 years. Never had an issue. Very good vehicles.  The RAV4 I can’t say because as I was drinking out of the sales lot the check engine light turns on.   I had to leave my brand new vehicle so it can be look into.  So sad.  Brand new and can’t drive it.
"01 30, 2020",The best car I have owned!,"This is the best car I test drove. It had more features than I expected.
It's easy to drive and comfortable and has good gas mileage.  I drove several before choosing this one."
"01 29, 2020",I own 2020 xle plug weather parget,"Pick up slow, engine a little noise, wind noise, uncomfortable with the seat too hard, Apple carplay too similar. The things I love is vehicle outside the body, interior design have some space to put the phone, coins and more, also I love the 6 different choice for the driver: Eco, Normal, Sports, Snow, Dust sand and Rock.. Love it. For my experience this vehicle suitable for the driver who loves and enjoy to drive not for racing...."
"01 20, 2020",The smoothest and most beautiful car I ever owned,This car has everything that I wanted in a car. It has more room than my previous vehicle. The car is an AWD which I love and it goes through snow like butter.
"01 19, 2020",Decent car,To slow when taking off. Its feel like it hold back. Takes a while to catch speed. Try sport n its a bot better but still laggs
"01 19, 2020",Very safe car.,I owned a RAV4 and was very satisfied but there were a few things that I was wanting to update.  My dar was 5 years old.  My new RAV4 has all the improvements that I was wanting.  Love it!
"01 14, 2020",El mas confiable que he tenido,"Este carro es el mejor que he tenido, es muy espacioso, brinda seguridad y confort, tiene 3 puertos Usb y sensores que hacen que manejes con mas seguridad."
"01  7, 2020",My family owns several different Toyota vehicle,My Rav4 2020 is a bigger feel than most smaller SUV's. Lots of extras with out the cost of most luxury cars. Lots of room!
"01  7, 2020",Toyota never disappoints!,"The 2020 Toyota Rav4 XLE is top notch! I love the increased interior space, all the new safety features (especially BSM), and the overall performance of my vehicle. I chose the white exterior, tan interior and she is a beauty! I have had several Toyotas in the past (Camry, Avalon, Rav4) and I am always pleased with the superb quality of vehicles that Toyota brings."
"01  7, 2020","Love, love my new Toyota!","I’ve wanted a Toyota for a long time . I knew when I drove it that This was the car for me ! It drives great, I’m short  and this car sits me up so that I see all areas ! This is an awesome car!"
"01  6, 2020",I love this 2020 Toyota rav4 xle,"I love this 2020 Toyota RAV4 Xle, come equip with apple car play and Android auto, run really smooth, I wish post how has mileage, my car 207 miles been at Norwalk Toyota for rattling noise and they misdiagnosed my concern"
"01  4, 2020",I knew it would be a great choice,"I went from a Prius to a RAV4. I knew I would stay with Toyota because they have always been reliable and can go hundreds of thousands of miles with little maintenance. I got the RAV4 XLE Premium because I wanted an SUV so that I would sit higher up and not scrape curbs. I also wanted leather seats. As a bonus it also has a sunroof, 19 inch wheels and tons of great safety features that make me feel very secure. I love my car and feel like it has great value for the price."
"01  3, 2020",Had one week and in the shop for repairs!,"I owned a 2017 Toyota 4Runner and I loved it! Traded it in recently for a more gas efficient RAV4. Exactly one week later in less than 500 miles on the odometer and it is in the shop. They told me it needs a new catalytic converter. It has been in the shop for over a week now!
This car is a comfortable ride however very uncomfortable to get in and out of for me anyway. The large screen blocks some view out the front window and light switches and such are difficult to locate in the dark. Just not easily accessible and very disappointed in this car overall. I bought the XLE version and the interior is not to my liking. Also Toyota is now do not come standard with floor mats. I think this is ridiculous! Brand new car should come with floor mats for goodness sakes!"
"01  3, 2020",The absolute best car I’ve ever owned,"Very spacious......very comfortable seats....smooth ride. If my hands were not on the steering wheel, I would probably think I’m in an airplane... awesome audio...beautiful blue color... an absolute joy.."
"01  3, 2020",Great vehicle,"The safety features are great, plenty of leg room, drives great and rides even better. Has emergency button to push for help, which is awesome when you have health issues."
"01  3, 2020",Great car,"The car looks great, runs great and I love all the safety features.  I would definitely recommend this suv.  I am beyond satisfied with my new vehicle."
"01  2, 2020",New 2020 Rav 4,"I turned in my 2017 Rav and found the 2020 to be totally redesigned. Its comfortable and better on gas. It's to early to tell what I really feel about it, but so far it's been great."
"01  2, 2020",Logical Car buying,This car is the first investment that I was proud to make. The resale value and quality of this car is top notch. It gets great gas mileage and has so many new features. I love the cruise control with steering assist. Complete game changer.
"01  1, 2020",Love the Toyota Rav 4,"This car has had many improvements since 2015! It has many more safety features, more comfort and is smarter than I am! Reading reviews of a car is one thing in that it is subjective. The 2020 Rav 4 is a dream!"
"01  1, 2020",Love it,"This car is perfect for Florida with safety features, gas mileage, comfort, technology, eco settings. I love the lunar rock color and new frame. Looks sleek"
"01  1, 2020",I love this car!,I bought it for both personal and work use. I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is a goat! Climbs anything! It is comfortable and the gas mileage is great!
"12 29, 2019",Exactly what I was looking for in a new car!,"This car has every feature I wanted in a new car! Best car I have ever owned! Style, comfort, and performance are at the top of my list. I will own Toyota as along as I live! Very satisfied!"
"12 27, 2019",The auto breaking is an issue.,"Test drive did not charge the non hybrids car battery enough to experience the auto breaking so wasn’t till I already owned that i discovered when the auto breaking/ engine cut off and restart releases it’s jarring enough to think I’ve been rear ended.  Good thing no one was behind me I would have never guessed Toyota would release a technology this poorly designed and would have accused them of rear ending me.      Yes i can turn it off each time I start the car,  but I should not have to and of course that factors into the gas savings.  I gave up a hybrid sonata that was smooth as silk transitioning but silly me wanted to go back to Toyota."
"12 21, 2019",Great ride and love safety features.,It is a vehicle I will use every day and in inclement weather so wanted depedable AWD vehicle that will last. Also wanted the extra safety features for my daughter who is a new driver.
"12 20, 2019",Toyota Universe,I was so pleased with the great customer service and good pricing. Please do meet Koshy Thomas who was great! He helped me with my first big purchase of buying my new Toyota Rav 4. You have to visit the Toyota Universe dealership in Little Falls!
"12 18, 2019",This will be my 5th Rav4,"I love the exterior look and color of the new 2020 RAV4 I’ve never have had a car that was a color, always silver, gray or taupe."
"12 16, 2019",Beautiful and Spacious,"It was a good deal and I love the car. My buying experience with my salesman Chris Keene was awesome, a very nice young man!!"
"12 10, 2019",Toyota is number one,Nothing I got everything in it I need I still don't need any thing to add to it everything is good to me you make more colors
"12  6, 2019",I prefer Toyota’s for a good reason,"This car is perfect for us. The leather seats with lumbar support on the driver’s side are very comfortable. I am short so it is great that I can pump the seat up for better visibility. The navigation screen is at eye level. This is a first for us. It is great to not have to take your eyes off of the road. The extra USB ports are wonderful. The cabin is very quiet on the road, the only exception is when you have to accelerate to merge, but acceleration doesn’t take long. I love the automatic lift gate. It is so convenient when shopping."
"11 22, 2019",Totally amazing sporty SUV Toyota 2020 XSE Hybrid,I love it The new 2020 XSE hybrid is very stylish looking excellent fuel economy about 48 on the freeway it has a 8 inch touch screen it reminds me of my I pad built in lots of room in the cabin with 4 drive modes . One of the cool things about this car is if you ever valet your car or give it to a kid or family member to borrow you can set up the parameters of the speed they’re going the miles the distance you can actually watch where the car is from your phone. Plus you can Drop the car off valet parking and we all know how they like to hot Rod peoples cars and take him on joyrides I can now set how fast that car will go and how many miles are allowed to drive it it all comes with the advanced tech package With car . Plus I can start the car anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi or the Internet and I can lock and unlock the doors if I want. There is 0 rode noise on this car . Last thing there over 3 k in profit don’t pay more than 36k for this car . My Favorite color is the blue print flame catch up
"11 21, 2019","Love all the safety features, especially RCTA",I like the rav as this is my second one. The safety features are great. Trunk area is good and also the rubber mats inside. Ride is good.
"11 19, 2019",Love it!,"Love it! Great car, comfortable, nice and easy to drive. It has great safety futures as well great convenience package.  Definitely would recommend to friends and family."
"11  5, 2019",More Than I Expected,"Soon after purchase I have taken the TRD Off Road model over 100 miles of gravel, dirt and rocky roads and climbed over 15,000 of elevation on two different trips. Tight steering radius made hairpin switchbacks easy and those short steep inclines were not noticed with the stock Falken Wildpeak AT tires and the setting Normal ""Rock and Sand"". Great gas mileage driving all the time in the Sport Mode when not off road. Spacious and comfortable inside. Great car Toyota !!!"
"10 13, 2019",2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited Review,"Perennially a best-selling SUV, the RAV4 can be had in a wide range of iterations, so it’s no wonder it’s so popular. Price-Leader LE models are pretty basic, but an available hybrid Powertrain Control is compelling. High-end Limited models can challenge the Lexus NX with their many luxury features and a new TRD off-road model promises enhanced capacity as they hit the trails. Its robust styling makes it look right at home with the Toyota 4Runner SUV and Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. Driving dynamics tend toward the mundane side of the spectrum, but most consumers will find the 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid’s ride comfortable and its handling comfortable. Adult passengers will also be pleased with Toyota’s generous legroom in both front and rear seats; Cargo Room is also competitive with the best in the segment.

2020 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID LIMITED REVIEW
Toyota introduces the TRD off-road model for 2020, which comes with unique 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a TRD off-road suspension kit with red Coil springs, and lots of TRD logos ear tags interior and exterior. Elsewhere in the lineup, Android Auto capability becomes a standard feature as does SiriusXM satellite radio; The XLE models now come with a Power-adjustable driver’s seat, but lose the standard moonroof, which becomes part of the optional convenience package. The mid-range Adventure model gets a leather wrapped steering wheel and Shift knob, but the Power Lift Gate model is now optional. Limited trims now come with the premium JBL sound system as standard.

"05 18, 2024",bought this vehicle new.,"bought this vehicle new. in & out for repairs....parts keep breaking or burning out. last repair $1700, electric break control issue. defective part.
prior another defective part $825...this one I argued with Toyota & got them to reimburse me. 
always had honda/ acuras. never any major problems over 20 years."
"10 29, 2023",Very happy with my purchase,After purchase I immediately took the car on an 800 mile road trip. It is much more comfortable and rides more smoothly than our older RAV4 and had plenty of pep for highway driving. Averaged over 37 MPG at highway speed of 70-80 MPH. Would have liked a power hatchback but overall I’m very satisfied with the options that came with it as an LE model.
"10 22, 2023",Not worth the money.,I bought a 2020 Rav 4 it has been in the shop more then anything. Always some with voltage and power steering.  Computer updates. I have sank more money into repairs then anything else. Not reliable or dependable for what I paid for the vehicle.
"10  9, 2023",toyota get in the game,no matter how basic a car the ability to open your garage door should be standard.  rav4 LE strips too many basic needs.  toyota stop being cheap get in the game
"06  9, 2023",Going Places,"Definition of practical while being affordable. All the bad reviews are because the geniuses who purchases them did no research. Auto Off engine kills your battery life, leaving it off is perfect. Packed with safety features, you want your kids in this car 100%. 28 mpg in the city and 35+ in 55 MPH zones. I get 38 mpg highway normally. Sure you can pay $35k+ for a hybrid, but this is well engineered already."
"05 24, 2023",Rav 4 2020,"2020 rav4 engine maintenance and they say is valve..$600 that is crazy..

Do not buy rav4 they say all rav 4 have this issue but it is not a recall.."
"02 11, 2023",Rav4 Battery dead at 2.5 years,"Car would not start at 25500 miles and 2.5 years.   Battery completely dead.  Trying to get battery recharged.  We drive car regularly, so there is NO reason for battery to be dead. 
Horrible situation to find car want start after only 2.5 years.
Checking on a used Honda."
"12 17, 2022",Highly Recommend,"We just bought a 2020 Rav4 LE as a Toyota Certified car with 21,500 miles.  We downsized (literally) from a 20 year old Sequoia, so we're getting accustomed to the smaller size.  My only complaint is that the cup holders seem to be a bit awkward.  I love the design and the all of the safety features and the handling while driving."
"11 14, 2022",Re: Rav 4 purchase,"I had a great experience when purchasing my new car. The says rep at Toyota of Lincoln Park, Edgar Rivera was extremely knowledgeable and professional."
"09 27, 2022",a little bit expensive but worthy,only concern I have is the tire pressure sensor(s) are a little bit sensitive.  This including the spare tire carried its own sensor. You only used spare tire once a while not daily.  quality is good. no CVT transmission problems for Adventure model. The 4 wheels drive for adventure is amazing drove in heavy rain Floody conditions without a scratch (which Forester and CRV were parking on roadside cannot move)
"09  8, 2022",Not as good as U think,Rough suspension and way too much road noise. Getting in and out will be more difficult for tall or long legged people as you sit very low even with drivers seat elevated. Radio is probably the best part of this vehicle as it has lots of tunable settings and good volume for those who like it loud. Windows fog up bad and take too long to clear when parked. Does not heat up fast like a V-8 does. Gas mileage is about half what is advertised and that is not good. Overall I couldn't get to a good review on this. 3.5/5 at best.
"09  2, 2022",Viva de milagro.,"RAVA 4 2020…frenos fallaron y aceleró grandemente. Se llenó de humo blanco…
Paramos en una cuneta en construcción perdida total… vivos de milagro.
15 meses de uso. TERRIBLE!!!"
"04 25, 2022",Love our Rav!!,"Virtually nothing has gone wrong with my 2020 RAV4. I have a small bit of buyer remorse, because wear hearing aids and there is a lot of road noise in my Rav. The Venza model turns out to be more luxurious and is much quieter. But, it has trade offs, as well. I might have gone with that, had I known. But the Rav is a great vehicle, no actual regrets. Lots of power when one needs it. And the breaking system kept me out of an accident, several months ago, the brakes went on when someone pulled out in front of me from a side road. I was not looking in that direction, and never would have braked soon enough. We recently went on a road trip from Washington state to Southern California and we’re delighted when we got 42 MPG. Great car, no regrets, maybe I’ll take it somewhere for some soundproofing."
"04  8, 2022","Old is gold, very reliable","I inherited this car from my grandmother, she bought it new in 2000 and barely ever drove it, so it was in great condition when I ended up getting it back in 2014. I've put about 50,000 miles on it between work, high school, and college. I love this little car, it's never given me an issue and is more reliable than some of my friends' cars from 2010 or newer. The interior leaves a bit to be desired; it's comfortable but the design of the dashboard isn't great and the cupholders are basically useless and get in the way of the gear changer. Well, back in y2k drinks weren't as big as they are now so I can hardly blame them, but it does still suck when I go to put my car in park and the stick won't even go all the way forward because my water bottle is blocking it. The paint coat was excellent and has only just recently (about 2019ish) began to oxidize and peel its topcoat. The SUV style isn't for everyone, but I like roomy, boxy cars like this one. One thing I REALLY appreciate is how quickly the AC and heating kick in. Being from south California, I need the AC to come on as quickly as possible in the hot summer, and my RAV4 is cooled down by the time I leave my driveway. This car has 129,000 miles on it, and I think I can take it for another 80,000 at least. It doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of a newer car with heated seats and electric door locks, but for its time it is more than a wonderful car, and I'll be sticking with Toyota for my next car as well."
"04  2, 2022",It was not a new car it had 300 hundred miles and,I traded 2 cars for this Rava 4 had 300.00 miles and they sold it to me for a New Car but it was not a new car with that many miles I will not buy another Toyota SUV from Sparks Toyota At Myrtle beach I was sick and I tole them I did not feel like messing with it but they pressure me in getting and I told them over and over that I did not feel like trading and they kept on and on they just done me wrong they should pay me for putting me thru all that stuff it was not right so what can I do about that let me know something thank
"03 24, 2021",A reliable car that's made very well,"I enjoy the car, going on long trips to Connecticut to visit my grandchildren never have to worry, I have told my friends about the RAV4 and two of them have bought it and are very happy"
"03 23, 2021",most reliable car I've owned,"This is the second Toyota I have owned. the first one being a 1989 Camry. it was my favorite car I have owned until now. I love Toyotas. they are reliable and comfortable. this car is no different, with the added bonus of being modern and having all the cool technology. I don't know how I lived with out Apple Car Play, before now. its a game changer. the seats in my  2020 XLE are what sold me. they are cloth and super comfortable. there is space for our family of four, without feeling like I am driving a bus. This SUV is perfect for us!"
"02 23, 2021",Smartphone,This car Quality is very good and this is a nice car. I love this car. Anyone can buy it at an affordable price. Thank you for sharing with us.
"02  4, 2021","Very Comfortable, smooth ride, and rekuable",I like sitting up higher and having a better view of the rode. It has comfortable seating and an easy to manage control panel. It is economical in terms of gas and oil
"01 31, 2021",I'm always be happy to have a Toyota as my car,"For me , Toyota is  the most best of the cars everyone should have for their family.  it's an economic car ,  it saves fuel  and it's a fighter vehicle."
"01 30, 2021",Best AWD SUV!,"Comfortable, best handling in the elements, Toyota reliability, all the features, great gas mileage, large trunk space. Only drawback to the XLE model is no sunroof and no power lift gate."
"01 24, 2021",Best Toyota so far,I absolutely love this car. I basically traded in my Toyotas every three years and I’ve had just about every model and this RAV4 is the most unbelievable car I’ve had I love it and definitely will get another one
"01  2, 2021",Least reliable car I have ever owned,"My 2020 Rav4 Hybrid has three major issues since purchased in August 2020. One, stalling, remains unresolved despite several attempts of the dealer to find the cause. Apparently many others have the same issue.
Another, 12v battery discharge due to heavy demand from various options, causes voltage levels to drop below that needed to start the car. A software fix and my taking initiative to deselect options such as automatic parking reduced demand on the battery. But the less-tna-full-size battery is an issue.  
A third issue, issues related to filling and pumping fuel from a redesigned gas tank, caused a lot of anxiety but has apparently been fixed.
Toyota's response has been less than I would expect given the widespread occurance of these issues.  Buyers were NOT advise of these issue when purchasing. Dealers service dept often expressed lack of awareness of the issues.
I do NOT recommend this car."
"12 30, 2020",Tbis was an Awesome purchase for my family,"This car is perfect for my family, we're enjoying the performance and room of the car. We took a trip a the ride was wonderful."
"12 22, 2020",Just bought it  So far I am happy but Give me time,"So Far I like it very much,  it is responsive. But since I have driven it for only 2 days i need l little more time to evaluate"
"12 18, 2020",Toyota RAV4,"This vehicle is really superb. It’s everything you need in a car. Hoping this last just like my Toyota Camry 06 model which I drove for 305,000 miles."
"12 16, 2020",issued,"paint not good and .
i wont buy toyota again the dealers when you come back them treat you very bad i will try next time another brand"
"12 15, 2020",I purchased a 2020 Rav 4 in February 2020 -,I've had nothing but problems out of this vehicle.  My dealership has replaced the battery 2 times - Spring and Winter 2020 - because something in this vehicle keeps depleting the battery.
"12  9, 2020",Fifth RAV4,"This is our 6th RAV 4 since 2009 under the lease program, not that previous RAVs have had issues but it's nice to drive a new car every few years and not have to worry about maintenance."
"11 29, 2020",RAV4 is a very comfortable easy to use vehicle tha,Vehicle had all the options that we could Asfoor to keep our daughter safe and with Toyota dependability and value what else can I say
"11 14, 2020",Love my car!,"My last car was a Nissan Sentra (never again Nissan). Last winter it got stuck in a quarter inch of snow on the tiniest incline in a parking lot. That’s when I knew I needed an SUV. Toyotas have always been reliable cars to me, and the new style of the RAV4 caught my eye, and I just knew I needed this car. Got a white XLE with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats and steering wheel, moonroof, premium sound system, power everything, push button start, etc. I love how it drives, super smooth and powerful for a 4-cylinder! I average about 28 miles to the gallon, and the Toyota Connect package is awesome! I can lock/unlock my doors, start my car remotely, and check the status of my car through the app! So cool! Also offers Wifi hotspot which has been good for my kids going on their virtual classrooms as we drive. Can’t wait to see what it can do in snow!"
"10 23, 2020",xxx Not good,"Never buy Toyota 
Should have gone with another manufacturer as nothing but problems which have not been repaired and not taken seriously by dealership as of now"
"10 21, 2020",Best Purchase!,"I am absolutely obsessed with my new Rav4! I previously owned a 2007 model and new when it was time to upgrade, I was going to stick with another Rav. The 2020 model is the best purchase I could have made, I am extremely thrilled and excited about it. Performance and reliability are so far a 100% in my book! I was at first apprehensive about the tire not being on the back any longer, as to me - that's what made the Rav stand out, but with the 2020, I love the new look of the body."
"10 21, 2020",Most comfortable vehicle I own,"This vehicle meets all my needs. The cabin is roomy with ample leg room. This by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned for long road trips. The blind spot monitor, back up camera and pre-collision system make this vehicle a truly safe, comfortable ride."
"10 20, 2020",2020 RAV4 Limited AWD,"We have driven a 2007 RAV4 limited AWD for almost 14 years.  It has been virtually trouble free so it was a no brainer to get the same car for the CEO (wife).  Have only driven it for a few hundred miles but the following stand out so far...

1.  Seating comfort is very good.
2.  The A/C makes it cold enough to hang meat inside the car.
3.  Pretty sporty looking for an SUV.
4.  So much info on the dash it will take some time to learn all of the functions.
5.  The addition of a trailer hitch for the bike rack virtually disables the ""Kick sensor"" for closing the back hatch.

Because of the short time of ownership, I cannot speak on the longevity or reliability of the car.   So far, so good and time will tell if this lives up to the reliability of our 2007 RAV4.  This survey makes you put in a rating for reliability"
"10 20, 2020",I love my suv,I'm greatly satisfied with my SUV. My salesman was very professional and showed me all about my new suv. I couldn't be more satisfied with it
"10 20, 2020",Best vehicle  I  have  every  owned.,"It's  beautiful  inside, lots of room. Safety  features  amazed me for the price I paid. All the features are easy to set. The ignition is  a little tricky  for me but I  am sure I  will adjust."
"10  8, 2020","Great Car, Last Toyota I will ever buy","Great Cars, Terrible People, dealer made buying a car worst than going to Dentist. Dealers sales Manager tried to chest bump me,A real Bully
Salesman turned out to be coward and disappeared"
"10  5, 2020",Lots of safety options in entry level car,We bought a new RAV4 for our oldest daughter and feel it’s the perfect car for her and our family. Not too small not too big and has a lot of safety features which will help a young driver. Toyotas are safe and dependable cars!

Comfortable enough for an 8 hour drive on   highway,  crossing from state to state.   Good cruise control, as well as good navigation features and ease of audio use.   Room in the cargo  area for my golf bag and weekend bag."
"09 30, 2020","heard and read, now own","This car has plenty of leg room in the  front and esp in the back.  We were looking for a bigger space in the back for a medium dog cage to fit. The ride is quiet and the phone sounds nice thru blue tooth. Im not a music fan so anything will do, but the music sounds great with the system. I love the thick car matts that came with the vehicle and looking forward to testing out all the options."
"09 30, 2020",Feel safe in my vehicle,"This meets all my needs and has more features than I was looking for, but ones that I  very much enjoy. I am a happy person driving my RAV4."

"09 23, 2020",It's an upgrade to me,"Went from a 2018 to the 2020 model and I like it. I'm not a big car guy so the feature really don't mean anything to me, but from what my gearheads friends have told me it was a smart buy."
"09 22, 2020",Most reliable car I've owned,"So happy I purchased this vehicle. Would highly recommend for a small family or even I single person. Plenty of leg room and cargo space. I have one in the color ""blue flame"" and it truly is a great car and very safe."

"09 10, 2020",This car rides wonderfully and has plenty of power,I really like the lane warnings and lane correction.  It is awesome to send and receive texts from the screen.  It is super comfortable and quiet.
"09 10, 2020",Really good suv,It performs very well overall with some minor setbacks. Under heavy rai the blind spot sensors might not detect an approaching vehicle. Same goes for the lane departure warning system. Other than that great ride.
"09  5, 2020",Fun car,This car met all our needs. Affordable and reliable without giving up all the bells and whistles! Plenty of room for two teenage boys in the back seat and all their stuff!
"08 31, 2020",I like this car,"After driving the Camry was by far the best . It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology."
"08 30, 2020",Favorite Car so far,"I love this car to death! I can’t ask for more. All the Amenities are there. Love the Navigation system and very friendly , welcoming you in every State you go. The drive is awesome , spacious and most of all EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURES. I feel very safe. ❤️👍"

"08 29, 2020",It's my fourth RAV 4.,"This is my fourth RAV 4.  It meets all my needs.  It is not a monster truck, it is just right.  It drives like a car."
"08 23, 2020",Regret buying a rav4,"I regret buying a rav4.  The vehicle has had a persistent rattle coming from the steering column and the dealer was unable to fix the problem.  In addition, the Bluetooth connection to an iPhone is unreliable.  Toyotas cost more than their competitors which is fine if you get superior quality but that’s not what I’m getting.  Buy a Honda instead."
"08 15, 2020",Toyota,"The car met my needs. Sporty. Like the way it drives. I am downsizing, but still enough room in the backseats. Lots of storage in the back"

"08 11, 2020",So far I'm very pleased!,My Rav 4 has met all my expectations since switching over from owning a Honda for many years. I have now chosen Toyota for reliability!
"08 10, 2020",I will continue tobuy this car because it reliable,This vehicle supports all of my needs. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this vehicle again when I want to trade in my leased vehicle. Larry H Miller dealership in Colorado Springs is my new favorite dealership for toyota vehicles.
"08  8, 2020",Fits like a glove feeling,"The only thing I wish would be a better take off from 0 mph to 60 mph.
The car is amazingly economical, despite its high center of gravity it does not lean at turns and behaves like a low seating Honda Accord.
It remains economical even when I I pull open trailer with the garden tractor on it!"
"08  7, 2020",Quality Vehicle,"The vehicle that I purchase exceeds all of my needs that I need to commute.  Comfortable ride, quiet and enough room to spare for passengers and cargo."
"08  6, 2020",Great car,Just purchased and already love it. So many high end features that are standard on this vehicle. You cannot beat a Toyota for value and performance!
"08  3, 2020",I feel safe in this SUV.,This SUV is well built. It is very spacious. I feel safe having my son in it  this SUV. I really like the color and the ability to be able to connect my phone to the vehicle.
"08  3, 2020",Still getting used to it.,"Although bought in February, I'm still trying to get used to certain new things that weren't on the 2014 RAV 4.  Such as the gas tank opener, which a friend had to find for me.  It's right next to the hood opener."
"08  1, 2020",Most reliable car I’ve ever purchased,"I am a very picky car shopper, I absolutely love this car I do not have any thing negative to report  . Fun to drive easy to use .  I love this rav 4"
"07 31, 2020",First new car,Love the vehicle.its smooth dependable and easy to drive with Bluetooth option because I do homecare and drive a lot! And wanted to get back into 4 wheel drive.
"07 31, 2020",I never owned a new car before,I wanted a RAV4 for several years now and I am very happy with my purchase and proud to own it. I’ve gotten May compliments on the car especially the color
"07 30, 2020",it is the perfect vehicle for me and my family,I really like this vehicle especially the new updated body type and its very comfortable interior as well. The size is perfect for me and my family.
"07 28, 2020",The 2020 RAV4 Does not Disappoint,"This SUV is spacious, drives well on both city streets, highways and dirt roads. The technology features are great and it’s not bad on gas at all! It’s not meant for anyone over 6’4” and stocky build like my husband.. But it’s a perfect fit for me! LOVE this ride!"
"07 27, 2020",RAV4 Hybrid Limited - Best RAV4 Ever,"This is my 4th RAV4 so obviously I am a fan. The hybrid has more power, more low end torque, and is just the most fun to drive of them all. Got all the bells and whistles and am enjoying the fun parts, but also appreciating the additional safety features. Thought the panoramic camera view would be just a toy but it is very useful for parking in tight places and not running over the dog. This model of RAV4 is a little longer and a little wider -- lots of room inside for the grandkid's car seats."
"07 26, 2020",Haven’t had a new car in 11 years,"This car was rated in the top 5 by Blue Book. I read several reviews before even test driving it. Performance is great, high tech and stylish. But three adults can’t fit comfortably which in the back seat, which is sad. I really wish the XLE, AWD included in the conference package or weather package self start and something very simple as a net to keep groceries and other items from moving back and forth In the cargo area."
"07 26, 2020",A++++++ Rav4 great step up!,"The car meet all our needs. I love that it has 5 usb ports, has CarPlay, the shape in front is fierce looking and a lot of trunk space."
"07 24, 2020",Great car,love the speed that this car delivers. Great gas mileage. It is what I have been looking for in a hybrid Car. Rav4 Limited Red
"07 23, 2020",Dream Car,"This car as been at the top of my purchase list for over 10 years. I’m so excited to finally own this SUV. My main reason for purchasing this vehicle is for the AWD, the additional “snow”, “sand/dirt”, “rock” features are a bonus. I also love that Toyota now has standard safety features which puts my mind at ease. All the new 2020 vehicles come with Car play as well so no need to worry about being distracted while driving. The absolute “cherry on top” is the 2 year maintenance free that Toyota offers on all their new vehicles. I’m in love with my new Toyota RAV4!!"
"07 20, 2020",Best Car and Dealership,"I test drove this Rav4 LE from Romeoville Toyota. My salesman Michael was so awesome at answering all of my questions and letting me test drive this vehicle! He gave me information on everything I needed to know about the vehicle and made my experience amazing! I am so excited to go back to purchase and I will definitely be referring Romeoville Toyota and Michael to anyone looking for a new, reliable car!"
"07 18, 2020",Amazing new design,Beautiful new design  I have the adventure trim which can tow more than the base model and we look forward to using for camping and our bikes
"07  3, 2020",Very good for a small suv,Great gas Mil. and being a 2020 it has a lot of features that my 2017 did  have. The safety features  that you get with toyota make it worth looking at this brand.
"06 28, 2020",Shout Out to Easton Koons Toyota,"My 2nd vehicle from Easton Koons!  Gary and Brad worked hard to make sure I was totally satisfied and to get me in this Rav4!   Gotta give Easton Toyota a visit!  You won't be disappointed.  The service has always been good over the years  as well, just an all around good choice."
"06 27, 2020",I test drove the rav4 xle,It’s a pretty nice suv but there are so many packages it will dive you crazy! To get a good rave4 with bigger wheels you got to step up to a rav4 premium and then you get more stuff like adjustable seats Partial heated steering wheel but not everyone what’s all that stuff it can get very pricey for a rav4. I’m currently looking at a Mazda witch is like 5.000 to 7.000 cheaper then a rav4 depending on the packages you want to get .
"06 25, 2020",Great Vehicle. I love that it!,I love that it can pick up and go if I need it to. There are so many helpful options that I’m not quite used to yet. I know they will be easy to learn though. I love the comfort of the seats. The back seats are comfortable as well. So far I love everything.
"06 24, 2020",Very comfortable lots of leg room,The vehicle is very comfortable alot of safety features like the console it rides smooth and quiet.  Love that i can start it from my phone.

"06 20, 2020",Very solid and good value,Plenty of space large cargo for its class. The new shape is improved than the old shape better handling and excellent safety features. Also the seats are more comfortable. The only thing a little noisy but great value
"06 19, 2020",EFFECIENT AND RELIABLE CAR,"THIS CAR PROVIDES OUR FAMILY COMFORT NEEDS IN TRAVELLING AND DRIVING EXPERIENCE. WITH ITS NAVIGATION SCREEN, USB PORTS, PROVISION OF AIR CONDITION OUTLET AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AND ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF THE AIR CONDITION AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE . THE KEY LESS FEATURES PROVIDES EASY ACCESS, SAFETY ,COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE WHILE LOADING AND UNLOADING ITEMS."
"06 17, 2020",ALL-TIME FAVORITE CAR BY FAR....,This car is awesome. I was able to get a steal because of COVID pricing which made it all the more worth wile. I test drove 6 different SUV's prior to this buy. I'm so glad I chose the RAV. I truly enjoy driving this car. It's so smart. Everything is taken care of with lane assist and dynamic cruise control. I have AWD and its made it through 2 feet of water and up to the mountains for skiing with no problem. This car is so comfortable. We love taking road trips. I honestly have never had a car that I look forward to driving everyday. I feel like I'm 16 and I'm not kidding. When people get in they complement the car. When I pull up they compliment the car. It was a win win at 0% Financing. Toyota also gives way over ask for your trade in. Check them out. It's worth it.
"06 16, 2020",Very reliable,"This car met all my needs , practical, spacious, a lot  of new features .  I Just been driving for a week maybe i just not used to slow pickup on transmission. But over i think its reluable"
"06 14, 2020",From 2005 Highlander to 2020 RAV4. Xle,Love our new RAV4.  Not quite as quiet as our previous highlander.  But it’s just fine.   Plenty of interior room.  Like all the technology options.  Would highly recommend.
"06 14, 2020",Most reliable cars made,"More interior room than our previous 2017. Flatter nose, and excellent pick up. More comfortable seating. Programming is easy. Will always count on Toyota durability. And their re-sale value"
"06 13, 2020",A new vehicle to drive,"The brand new vehicle is already a pleasure to drive.  Some of the new features will take some getting used to, but I will get the hang of it eventually."
"06 10, 2020",I love the car but Im not happy with the service,"I love the car

"05 16, 2020",Car had all of the new safety features we desired.,"Car has met our needs.  We have owned our RAV4 for less than a month, so we are still getting used to its drive ability.  Like the light grey color match for both interior and exterior.  Owners manual is generic and seems full of warnings rather than a quick guide to perform settings, and all features mentioned (if equipped) may or may not  be included on our car."
"05 13, 2020",Wonderful 2020 Toyota RAV4,"This is our first RAV4, and we love it so far. The ride is so smooth, the look of the car inside and out is very classy. The spacing inside is very nice.

"03 14, 2020",Best car we have ever owned/leased.,"This is the best Toyota we have ever owned/leased.  Toyota has really
 thought about what an owner needs to have an enjoyable driving experience.  The comfort level of this car is the best we have ever experienced."
"03 13, 2020",I expect it to last just like my other Yotes.,"I opted for the XLE AWD trim for driving to trailheads when I go hiking. It is a feature packed car for the money. The tech is amazing. 

It reads road signs

It centers you on the lane, automatically following gentle curves on the highway and gently assists you if it thinks you're drifting

Turns headlights on and off, turns high beams on when there is no oncoming traffic

Can use cruise controls in stop and go traffic and turns the engine off if you're stopped waiting for lights to change.

Blindspot monitor

Alerts you if traffic is coming while you're backing up.

All LED head and tail lights means they will almost never burn out for the life of the car.

Different AWD software profiles for different surfaces.

Comes with Toyota's version of Onstar and Apple and Android interfaces.

It also has plenty of room for my gear and just the right size for a good balance of fuel economy and easy handling.

Other features I like:

Dual zone  and rear passengers AC, USB /power ports in the rear passenger and cargo areas.

Cargo cover

Factory tint

Factory rails and crossbars

And of course it is a Toyota. Might not be exciting to drive but it will soldier on for a decade or two!

The only thing I don't like is the throttle response from a stop in anything but Sport mode. So I just keep it in Sport mode!"
"03  8, 2020",Super comfortable,"Great car, easy to drive and very comfortable. Looks great too. Lots of excellent safety features. I love the ride in a Toyota. Holds the road great!"
"03  7, 2020",Smoothest car ride ever,"This SUV is bigger than our older one. Love the dark interior and overall appearance of the entire vehicle.  Smooth ride, great gas mileage.  Will definitely purchase another Rav 4 in the future."
"03  4, 2020","Great car, worth every penny.",This car far exceeded my expectations. It is really nice on the outside and inside and super gas efficient. Also it's the trd off road trim and my car is a beast!
"03  4, 2020",So far most reliable car owned!,"I had a 2015 Rav4 before and now I have a 2020 Rav4. All around this car is great!! Great on gas, reliable, rides smooth, very roomy and has alot more features. Best decision ever made to get this 2020 Rav4."
"03  3, 2020",Great Car!!,My new RAV4 runs great and is well equipped in addition to being roomy.  It has all the whistles and bells one needs.  I believe I made a good choice and am very happy with my selection.
"02 28, 2020",Awesome car to own.,I have owned a RAV4 since 2005 and will continue to buy them. It’s just what i need. The design is nice for this year more technology great automobile.
"02 26, 2020",Not a winner,"I test drove 7 SUVs while researching for a purchase.  Before I did my first test drive I thought the I'd be buying a RAV4.  After my drive of the RAV4 though I wouldn't even put it in the top 4.  The performance of the car is pretty good but the ride is very stiff and uncomfortable.  The car has a full array of safety features but their usability leaves something to be wanted.  I don't think the exterior styling is as good as the Mazda CX-5, the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape or even the Chevy Equinox.  The interior is fairly well designed and executed but not on the same level as the Forester."
"02 26, 2020",Fits my family of 4 and room for my dog.,"This is all the room I need! I wanted a car that was good on gas, awd and very roomy. My kids and dogs have planty more space, I use to have a Hyundai elantra."
"02 25, 2020",My first Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD,"I had a Nissan Maxima for 10 years and the time came to start looking for a new car. The vehicles that I test drove were Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Nissan Rogue ,  VW Tiguan and Toyota Rav 4. With the help of  Abdul Onisemoh  (Salesman at Northside Toyota, 6042 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL 60659) I decided on the Rav 4.
I made the best decision, and I give this car a 4+ out of 5 stars."
"02 25, 2020",Toyota RAV4 I am driving in Highway very  good,I think it is very good and also it is very good on the highway. The design of the car is amazing I love it.
"02 21, 2020",New purchase,"This is my first time owning a Toyota vehicle. I have had the RAV 4 for 2 days now. I enjoy how it handles, the safety features, and all the extras that come standard with the base model. I am hoping to have this SUV for many years to come!"
"02 20, 2020",Great car,"All the fit and finish Toyota is know for and some pleasant surprises that the car has. Ride is great and the interior is really nice. The engine is weak, however, I feel it is better to have mpg vs speedy acceleration."
"02 19, 2020",RAV4 XLE Permium,"Just got this car and i am loving it. Drive is smooth, power acceleration is good. ECO and Sport modes save on gas and get you moving. I love the comfort and all of the options."
"02 16, 2020",Very stylish,I like the all wheel drive and the comfort of the interior -plenty of room for the grandkids and dog.  We feel very safe driving this auto.
"02 15, 2020",Uncomfortable seating. Very noisy!,Very uncomfortable seating. I can’t imagine how it would be after a long ride. Very noisy. You have to put the radio on loud to drown out the noise.  Not many features are standard as they are on other SUV’s.  Don’t recommend it.
"02 12, 2020",My First Brand New Car Purchase for a Reason,"I've been on the market for a new vehicle for about 6 months.  I decided on the 2020 Rav4 XLE AWD because it is the total package.  There is nothing that has been overlooked regarding comfort, drive ability, safety rating, and visual aesthetic.  It is the best value for the money.  I'm a Toyota customer for life!"
"02 10, 2020",RUBY FLARE RED RAV4 LIMITED,We replaced our prior RAV4 with this vehicle due to the high safety standards and overall reliability of Toyota. Lots of bells and whistles but also driver can decide which to use and which not to use. Navigation is great.
"02  5, 2020",Very sporty looking the color is what got our atte,"We had been looking to purchase a rav4 for some time but other dealers didn't have the color in stock.
Finally we walk into Red mccombs and sure enough it was on the show room floor.."
"02  2, 2020","Only had it for two months,comfortable smooth ride","Car is great,wish it had a few features like my previous PriusV , a cup
holder for the front passenger on far right of dash, two glove boxes,
better navigation system, not this new Car Play,especially when I do not
own an I Phone. Front dash instrument pannel on Prius V is the best ever built , regardless of make of vehicle ,should be in all makes.Put
it in the RAV4"
"02  2, 2020",Don’t know if it’s a reliable car,It’s beautiful and I been driving Toyota’s for over 24 years. Never had an issue. Very good vehicles.  The RAV4 I can’t say because as I was drinking out of the sales lot the check engine light turns on.   I had to leave my brand new vehicle so it can be look into.  So sad.  Brand new and can’t drive it.
"01 30, 2020",The best car I have owned!,"This is the best car I test drove. It had more features than I expected.
It's easy to drive and comfortable and has good gas mileage.  I drove several before choosing this one."
"01 29, 2020",I own 2020 xle plug weather parget,"Pick up slow, engine a little noise, wind noise, uncomfortable with the seat too hard, Apple carplay too similar. The things I love is vehicle outside the body, interior design have some space to put the phone, coins and more, also I love the 6 different choice for the driver: Eco, Normal, Sports, Snow, Dust sand and Rock.. Love it. For my experience this vehicle suitable for the driver who loves and enjoy to drive not for racing...."
"01 20, 2020",The smoothest and most beautiful car I ever owned,This car has everything that I wanted in a car. It has more room than my previous vehicle. The car is an AWD which I love and it goes through snow like butter.
"01 19, 2020",Decent car,To slow when taking off. Its feel like it hold back. Takes a while to catch speed. Try sport n its a bot better but still laggs
"01 19, 2020",Very safe car.,I owned a RAV4 and was very satisfied but there were a few things that I was wanting to update.  My dar was 5 years old.  My new RAV4 has all the improvements that I was wanting.  Love it!
"01 14, 2020",El mas confiable que he tenido,"Este carro es el mejor que he tenido, es muy espacioso, brinda seguridad y confort, tiene 3 puertos Usb y sensores que hacen que manejes con mas seguridad."
"01  7, 2020",My family owns several different Toyota vehicle,My Rav4 2020 is a bigger feel than most smaller SUV's. Lots of extras with out the cost of most luxury cars. Lots of room!
"01  7, 2020",Toyota never disappoints!,"The 2020 Toyota Rav4 XLE is top notch! I love the increased interior space, all the new safety features (especially BSM), and the overall performance of my vehicle. I chose the white exterior, tan interior and she is a beauty! I have had several Toyotas in the past (Camry, Avalon, Rav4) and I am always pleased with the superb quality of vehicles that Toyota brings."
"01  7, 2020","Love, love my new Toyota!","I’ve wanted a Toyota for a long time . I knew when I drove it that This was the car for me ! It drives great, I’m short  and this car sits me up so that I see all areas ! This is an awesome car!"
"01  6, 2020",I love this 2020 Toyota rav4 xle,"I love this 2020 Toyota RAV4 Xle, come equip with apple car play and Android auto, run really smooth, I wish post how has mileage, my car 207 miles been at Norwalk Toyota for rattling noise and they misdiagnosed my concern"
"01  4, 2020",I knew it would be a great choice,"I went from a Prius to a RAV4. I knew I would stay with Toyota because they have always been reliable and can go hundreds of thousands of miles with little maintenance. I got the RAV4 XLE Premium because I wanted an SUV so that I would sit higher up and not scrape curbs. I also wanted leather seats. As a bonus it also has a sunroof, 19 inch wheels and tons of great safety features that make me feel very secure. I love my car and feel like it has great value for the price."
"01  3, 2020",Had one week and in the shop for repairs!,"I owned a 2017 Toyota 4Runner and I loved it! Traded it in recently for a more gas efficient RAV4. Exactly one week later in less than 500 miles on the odometer and it is in the shop. They told me it needs a new catalytic converter. It has been in the shop for over a week now!
This car is a comfortable ride however very uncomfortable to get in and out of for me anyway. The large screen blocks some view out the front window and light switches and such are difficult to locate in the dark. Just not easily accessible and very disappointed in this car overall. I bought the XLE version and the interior is not to my liking. Also Toyota is now do not come standard with floor mats. I think this is ridiculous! Brand new car should come with floor mats for goodness sakes!"
"01  3, 2020",The absolute best car I’ve ever owned,"Very spacious......very comfortable seats....smooth ride. If my hands were not on the steering wheel, I would probably think I’m in an airplane... awesome audio...beautiful blue color... an absolute joy.."
"01  3, 2020",Great vehicle,"The safety features are great, plenty of leg room, drives great and rides even better. Has emergency button to push for help, which is awesome when you have health issues."
"01  3, 2020",Great car,"The car looks great, runs great and I love all the safety features.  I would definitely recommend this suv.  I am beyond satisfied with my new vehicle."
"01  2, 2020",New 2020 Rav 4,"I turned in my 2017 Rav and found the 2020 to be totally redesigned. Its comfortable and better on gas. It's to early to tell what I really feel about it, but so far it's been great."
"01  2, 2020",Logical Car buying,This car is the first investment that I was proud to make. The resale value and quality of this car is top notch. It gets great gas mileage and has so many new features. I love the cruise control with steering assist. Complete game changer.
"01  1, 2020",Love the Toyota Rav 4,"This car has had many improvements since 2015! It has many more safety features, more comfort and is smarter than I am! Reading reviews of a car is one thing in that it is subjective. The 2020 Rav 4 is a dream!"
"01  1, 2020",Love it,"This car is perfect for Florida with safety features, gas mileage, comfort, technology, eco settings. I love the lunar rock color and new frame. Looks sleek"

"12 27, 2019",The auto breaking is an issue.,"Test drive did not charge the non hybrids car battery enough to experience the auto breaking so wasn’t till I already owned that i discovered when the auto breaking/ engine cut off and restart releases it’s jarring enough to think I’ve been rear ended.  Good thing no one was behind me I would have never guessed Toyota would release a technology this poorly designed and would have accused them of rear ending me.      Yes i can turn it off each time I start the car,  but I should not have to and of course that factors into the gas savings.  I gave up a hybrid sonata that was smooth as silk transitioning but silly me wanted to go back to Toyota."
"12 21, 2019",Great ride and love safety features.,It is a vehicle I will use every day and in inclement weather so wanted depedable AWD vehicle that will last. Also wanted the extra safety features for my daughter who is a new driver.
"12 20, 2019",Toyota Universe,I was so pleased with the great customer service and good pricing. Please do meet Koshy Thomas who was great! He helped me with my first big purchase of buying my new Toyota Rav 4. You have to visit the Toyota Universe dealership in Little Falls!
"12 18, 2019",This will be my 5th Rav4,"I love the exterior look and color of the new 2020 RAV4 I’ve never have had a car that was a color, always silver, gray or taupe."
"12 16, 2019",Beautiful and Spacious,"It was a good deal and I love the car. My buying experience with my salesman Chris Keene was awesome, a very nice young man!!"
"12 10, 2019",Toyota is number one,Nothing I got everything in it I need I still don't need any thing to add to it everything is good to me you make more colors
"12  6, 2019",I prefer Toyota’s for a good reason,"This car is perfect for us. The leather seats with lumbar support on the driver’s side are very comfortable. I am short so it is great that I can pump the seat up for better visibility. The navigation screen is at eye level. This is a first for us. It is great to not have to take your eyes off of the road. The extra USB ports are wonderful. The cabin is very quiet on the road, the only exception is when you have to accelerate to merge, but acceleration doesn’t take long. I love the automatic lift gate. It is so convenient when shopping."
"11 22, 2019",Totally amazing sporty SUV Toyota 2020 XSE Hybrid,I love it The new 2020 XSE hybrid is very stylish looking excellent fuel economy about 48 on the freeway it has a 8 inch touch screen it reminds me of my I pad built in lots of room in the cabin with 4 drive modes . One of the cool things about this car is if you ever valet your car or give it to a kid or family member to borrow you can set up the parameters of the speed they’re going the miles the distance you can actually watch where the car is from your phone. Plus you can Drop the car off valet parking and we all know how they like to hot Rod peoples cars and take him on joyrides I can now set how fast that car will go and how many miles are allowed to drive it it all comes with the advanced tech package With car . Plus I can start the car anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi or the Internet and I can lock and unlock the doors if I want. There is 0 rode noise on this car . Last thing there over 3 k in profit don’t pay more than 36k for this car . My Favorite color is the blue print flame catch up
"11 21, 2019","Love all the safety features, especially RCTA",I like the rav as this is my second one. The safety features are great. Trunk area is good and also the rubber mats inside. Ride is good.
"11 19, 2019",Love it!,"Love it! Great car, comfortable, nice and easy to drive. It has great safety futures as well great convenience package.  Definitely would recommend to friends and family."
"11  5, 2019",More Than I Expected,"Soon after purchase I have taken the TRD Off Road model over 100 miles of gravel, dirt and rocky roads and climbed over 15,000 of elevation on two different trips. Tight steering radius made hairpin switchbacks easy and those short steep inclines were not noticed with the stock Falken Wildpeak AT tires and the setting Normal ""Rock and Sand"". Great gas mileage driving all the time in the Sport Mode when not off road. Spacious and comfortable inside. Great car Toyota !!!"
"10 13, 2019",2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited Review,"Perennially a best-selling SUV, the RAV4 can be had in a wide range of iterations, so it’s no wonder it’s so popular. Price-Leader LE models are pretty basic, but an available hybrid Powertrain Control is compelling. High-end Limited models can challenge the Lexus NX with their many luxury features and a new TRD off-road model promises enhanced capacity as they hit the trails. Its robust styling makes it look right at home with the Toyota 4Runner SUV and Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. Driving dynamics tend toward the mundane side of the spectrum, but most consumers will find the 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid’s ride comfortable and its handling comfortable. Adult passengers will also be pleased with Toyota’s generous legroom in both front and rear seats; Cargo Room is also competitive with the best in the segment.

2020 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID LIMITED REVIEW
Toyota introduces the TRD off-road model for 2020, which comes with unique 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a TRD off-road suspension kit with red Coil springs, and lots of TRD logos ear tags interior and exterior. Elsewhere in the lineup, Android Auto capability becomes a standard feature as does SiriusXM satellite radio; The XLE models now come with a Power-adjustable driver’s seat, but lose the standard moonroof, which becomes part of the optional convenience package. The mid-range Adventure model gets a leather wrapped steering wheel and Shift knob, but the Power Lift Gate model is now optional. Limited trims now come with the premium JBL sound system as standard.

"05 18, 2024",bought this vehicle new.,"bought this vehicle new. in & out for repairs....parts keep breaking or burning out. last repair $1700, electric break control issue. defective part.
prior another defective part $825...this one I argued with Toyota & got them to reimburse me. 
always had honda/ acuras. never any major problems over 20 years."
"10 29, 2023",Very happy with my purchase,After purchase I immediately took the car on an 800 mile road trip. It is much more comfortable and rides more smoothly than our older RAV4 and had plenty of pep for highway driving. Averaged over 37 MPG at highway speed of 70-80 MPH. Would have liked a power hatchback but overall I’m very satisfied with the options that came with it as an LE model.
"10 22, 2023",Not worth the money.,I bought a 2020 Rav 4 it has been in the shop more then anything. Always some with voltage and power steering.  Computer updates. I have sank more money into repairs then anything else. Not reliable or dependable for what I paid for the vehicle.
"10  9, 2023",toyota get in the game,no matter how basic a car the ability to open your garage door should be standard.  rav4 LE strips too many basic needs.  toyota stop being cheap get in the game
"06  9, 2023",Going Places,"Definition of practical while being affordable. All the bad reviews are because the geniuses who purchases them did no research. Auto Off engine kills your battery life, leaving it off is perfect. Packed with safety features, you want your kids in this car 100%. 28 mpg in the city and 35+ in 55 MPH zones. I get 38 mpg highway normally. Sure you can pay $35k+ for a hybrid, but this is well engineered already."
"05 24, 2023",Rav 4 2020,"2020 rav4 engine maintenance and they say is valve..$600 that is crazy..

Do not buy rav4 they say all rav 4 have this issue but it is not a recall.."
"02 11, 2023",Rav4 Battery dead at 2.5 years,"Car would not start at 25500 miles and 2.5 years.   Battery completely dead.  Trying to get battery recharged.  We drive car regularly, so there is NO reason for battery to be dead. 
Horrible situation to find car want start after only 2.5 years.
Checking on a used Honda."
"12 17, 2022",Highly Recommend,"We just bought a 2020 Rav4 LE as a Toyota Certified car with 21,500 miles.  We downsized (literally) from a 20 year old Sequoia, so we're getting accustomed to the smaller size.  My only complaint is that the cup holders seem to be a bit awkward.  I love the design and the all of the safety features and the handling while driving."
"11 14, 2022",Re: Rav 4 purchase,"I had a great experience when purchasing my new car. The says rep at Toyota of Lincoln Park, Edgar Rivera was extremely knowledgeable and professional."
"09 27, 2022",a little bit expensive but worthy,only concern I have is the tire pressure sensor(s) are a little bit sensitive.  This including the spare tire carried its own sensor. You only used spare tire once a while not daily.  quality is good. no CVT transmission problems for Adventure model. The 4 wheels drive for adventure is amazing drove in heavy rain Floody conditions without a scratch (which Forester and CRV were parking on roadside cannot move)
"09  8, 2022",Not as good as U think,Rough suspension and way too much road noise. Getting in and out will be more difficult for tall or long legged people as you sit very low even with drivers seat elevated. Radio is probably the best part of this vehicle as it has lots of tunable settings and good volume for those who like it loud. Windows fog up bad and take too long to clear when parked. Does not heat up fast like a V-8 does. Gas mileage is about half what is advertised and that is not good. Overall I couldn't get to a good review on this. 3.5/5 at best.
"09  2, 2022",Viva de milagro.,"RAVA 4 2020…frenos fallaron y aceleró grandemente. Se llenó de humo blanco…
Paramos en una cuneta en construcción perdida total… vivos de milagro.
15 meses de uso. TERRIBLE!!!"
"04 25, 2022",Love our Rav!!,"Virtually nothing has gone wrong with my 2020 RAV4. I have a small bit of buyer remorse, because wear hearing aids and there is a lot of road noise in my Rav. The Venza model turns out to be more luxurious and is much quieter. But, it has trade offs, as well. I might have gone with that, had I known. But the Rav is a great vehicle, no actual regrets. Lots of power when one needs it. And the breaking system kept me out of an accident, several months ago, the brakes went on when someone pulled out in front of me from a side road. I was not looking in that direction, and never would have braked soon enough. We recently went on a road trip from Washington state to Southern California and we’re delighted when we got 42 MPG. Great car, no regrets, maybe I’ll take it somewhere for some soundproofing."
"04  8, 2022","Old is gold, very reliable","I inherited this car from my grandmother, she bought it new in 2000 and barely ever drove it, so it was in great condition when I ended up getting it back in 2014. I've put about 50,000 miles on it between work, high school, and college. I love this little car, it's never given me an issue and is more reliable than some of my friends' cars from 2010 or newer. The interior leaves a bit to be desired; it's comfortable but the design of the dashboard isn't great and the cupholders are basically useless and get in the way of the gear changer. Well, back in y2k drinks weren't as big as they are now so I can hardly blame them, but it does still suck when I go to put my car in park and the stick won't even go all the way forward because my water bottle is blocking it. The paint coat was excellent and has only just recently (about 2019ish) began to oxidize and peel its topcoat. The SUV style isn't for everyone, but I like roomy, boxy cars like this one. One thing I REALLY appreciate is how quickly the AC and heating kick in. Being from south California, I need the AC to come on as quickly as possible in the hot summer, and my RAV4 is cooled down by the time I leave my driveway. This car has 129,000 miles on it, and I think I can take it for another 80,000 at least. It doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of a newer car with heated seats and electric door locks, but for its time it is more than a wonderful car, and I'll be sticking with Toyota for my next car as well."
"04  2, 2022",It was not a new car it had 300 hundred miles and,I traded 2 cars for this Rava 4 had 300.00 miles and they sold it to me for a New Car but it was not a new car with that many miles I will not buy another Toyota SUV from Sparks Toyota At Myrtle beach I was sick and I tole them I did not feel like messing with it but they pressure me in getting and I told them over and over that I did not feel like trading and they kept on and on they just done me wrong they should pay me for putting me thru all that stuff it was not right so what can I do about that let me know something thank
"03 24, 2021",A reliable car that's made very well,"I enjoy the car, going on long trips to Connecticut to visit my grandchildren never have to worry, I have told my friends about the RAV4 and two of them have bought it and are very happy"
"03 23, 2021",most reliable car I've owned,"This is the second Toyota I have owned. the first one being a 1989 Camry. it was my favorite car I have owned until now. I love Toyotas. they are reliable and comfortable. this car is no different, with the added bonus of being modern and having all the cool technology. I don't know how I lived with out Apple Car Play, before now. its a game changer. the seats in my  2020 XLE are what sold me. they are cloth and super comfortable. there is space for our family of four, without feeling like I am driving a bus. This SUV is perfect for us!"
"02 23, 2021",Smartphone,This car Quality is very good and this is a nice car. I love this car. Anyone can buy it at an affordable price. Thank you for sharing with us.
"02  4, 2021","Very Comfortable, smooth ride, and rekuable",I like sitting up higher and having a better view of the rode. It has comfortable seating and an easy to manage control panel. It is economical in terms of gas and oil
"01 31, 2021",I'm always be happy to have a Toyota as my car,"For me , Toyota is  the most best of the cars everyone should have for their family.  it's an economic car ,  it saves fuel  and it's a fighter vehicle."
"01 30, 2021",Best AWD SUV!,"Comfortable, best handling in the elements, Toyota reliability, all the features, great gas mileage, large trunk space. Only drawback to the XLE model is no sunroof and no power lift gate."
"01 24, 2021",Best Toyota so far,I absolutely love this car. I basically traded in my Toyotas every three years and I’ve had just about every model and this RAV4 is the most unbelievable car I’ve had I love it and definitely will get another one
"01  2, 2021",Least reliable car I have ever owned,"My 2020 Rav4 Hybrid has three major issues since purchased in August 2020. One, stalling, remains unresolved despite several attempts of the dealer to find the cause. Apparently many others have the same issue.
Another, 12v battery discharge due to heavy demand from various options, causes voltage levels to drop below that needed to start the car. A software fix and my taking initiative to deselect options such as automatic parking reduced demand on the battery. But the less-tna-full-size battery is an issue.  
A third issue, issues related to filling and pumping fuel from a redesigned gas tank, caused a lot of anxiety but has apparently been fixed.
Toyota's response has been less than I would expect given the widespread occurance of these issues.  Buyers were NOT advise of these issue when purchasing. Dealers service dept often expressed lack of awareness of the issues.
I do NOT recommend this car."
"12 30, 2020",Tbis was an Awesome purchase for my family,"This car is perfect for my family, we're enjoying the performance and room of the car. We took a trip a the ride was wonderful."
"12 22, 2020",Just bought it  So far I am happy but Give me time,"So Far I like it very much,  it is responsive. But since I have driven it for only 2 days i need l little more time to evaluate"
"12 18, 2020",Toyota RAV4,"This vehicle is really superb. It’s everything you need in a car. Hoping this last just like my Toyota Camry 06 model which I drove for 305,000 miles."
"12 16, 2020",issued,"paint not good and .
i wont buy toyota again the dealers when you come back them treat you very bad i will try next time another brand"
"12 15, 2020",I purchased a 2020 Rav 4 in February 2020 -,I've had nothing but problems out of this vehicle.  My dealership has replaced the battery 2 times - Spring and Winter 2020 - because something in this vehicle keeps depleting the battery.
"12  9, 2020",Fifth RAV4,"This is our 6th RAV 4 since 2009 under the lease program, not that previous RAVs have had issues but it's nice to drive a new car every few years and not have to worry about maintenance."
"11 29, 2020",RAV4 is a very comfortable easy to use vehicle tha,Vehicle had all the options that we could Asfoor to keep our daughter safe and with Toyota dependability and value what else can I say
"11 14, 2020",Love my car!,"My last car was a Nissan Sentra (never again Nissan). Last winter it got stuck in a quarter inch of snow on the tiniest incline in a parking lot. That’s when I knew I needed an SUV. Toyotas have always been reliable cars to me, and the new style of the RAV4 caught my eye, and I just knew I needed this car. Got a white XLE with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats and steering wheel, moonroof, premium sound system, power everything, push button start, etc. I love how it drives, super smooth and powerful for a 4-cylinder! I average about 28 miles to the gallon, and the Toyota Connect package is awesome! I can lock/unlock my doors, start my car remotely, and check the status of my car through the app! So cool! Also offers Wifi hotspot which has been good for my kids going on their virtual classrooms as we drive. Can’t wait to see what it can do in snow!"
"10 23, 2020",xxx Not good,"Never buy Toyota 
Should have gone with another manufacturer as nothing but problems which have not been repaired and not taken seriously by dealership as of now"
"10 21, 2020",Best Purchase!,"I am absolutely obsessed with my new Rav4! I previously owned a 2007 model and new when it was time to upgrade, I was going to stick with another Rav. The 2020 model is the best purchase I could have made, I am extremely thrilled and excited about it. Performance and reliability are so far a 100% in my book! I was at first apprehensive about the tire not being on the back any longer, as to me - that's what made the Rav stand out, but with the 2020, I love the new look of the body."
"10 21, 2020",Most comfortable vehicle I own,"This vehicle meets all my needs. The cabin is roomy with ample leg room. This by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned for long road trips. The blind spot monitor, back up camera and pre-collision system make this vehicle a truly safe, comfortable ride."
"10 20, 2020",2020 RAV4 Limited AWD,"We have driven a 2007 RAV4 limited AWD for almost 14 years.  It has been virtually trouble free so it was a no brainer to get the same car for the CEO (wife).  Have only driven it for a few hundred miles but the following stand out so far...

1.  Seating comfort is very good.
2.  The A/C makes it cold enough to hang meat inside the car.
3.  Pretty sporty looking for an SUV.
4.  So much info on the dash it will take some time to learn all of the functions.
5.  The addition of a trailer hitch for the bike rack virtually disables the ""Kick sensor"" for closing the back hatch.

Because of the short time of ownership, I cannot speak on the longevity or reliability of the car.   So far, so good and time will tell if this lives up to the reliability of our 2007 RAV4.  This survey makes you put in a rating for reliability"
"10 20, 2020",I love my suv,I'm greatly satisfied with my SUV. My salesman was very professional and showed me all about my new suv. I couldn't be more satisfied with it
"10 20, 2020",Best vehicle  I  have  every  owned.,"It's  beautiful  inside, lots of room. Safety  features  amazed me for the price I paid. All the features are easy to set. The ignition is  a little tricky  for me but I  am sure I  will adjust."
"10  8, 2020","Great Car, Last Toyota I will ever buy","Great Cars, Terrible People, dealer made buying a car worst than going to Dentist. Dealers sales Manager tried to chest bump me,A real Bully
Salesman turned out to be coward and disappeared"
"10  5, 2020",Lots of safety options in entry level car,We bought a new RAV4 for our oldest daughter and feel it’s the perfect car for her and our family. Not too small not too big and has a lot of safety features which will help a young driver. Toyotas are safe and dependable cars!
"10  4, 2020",Very good,It is the best car I have sevn years driving toyota RAV 4 it is a good car it is good driving saving on gaz

"09 30, 2020",Good looking vehicle.  Comfortable,"This car met all my needs.  Safety on the highway and added safety in extreme winter conditions.  Comfortable enough for an 8 hour drive on   highway,  crossing from state to state.   Good cruise control, as well as good navigation features and ease of audio use.   Room in the cargo  area for my golf bag and weekend bag."
"09 30, 2020","heard and read, now own","This car has plenty of leg room in the  front and esp in the back.  We were looking for a bigger space in the back for a medium dog cage to fit. The ride is quiet and the phone sounds nice thru blue tooth. Im not a music fan so anything will do, but the music sounds great with the system. I love the thick car matts that came with the vehicle and looking forward to testing out all the options."
"09 30, 2020",Feel safe in my vehicle,"This meets all my needs and has more features than I was looking for, but ones that I  very much enjoy. I am a happy person driving my RAV4."
"09 25, 2020",Traded a Honda for a Toyota,"I have only had it for 1 week, but I really like it. It is very stylish. Will need to add a few accessories and more window tint"
"09 24, 2020",Best ever,This car meets all my needs and more. I would recommend for anyone. Very nice to drive. Love the color. Lunar Rock !! Great gas mileage.
"09 24, 2020",Excellent buy,"Perfect car for working class family, it has everything you need and more, safe, reliable, best value I ever had, I ready recommended for any body, you will not be desapointed, I love it."
"09 23, 2020",It's an upgrade to me,"Went from a 2018 to the 2020 model and I like it. I'm not a big car guy so the feature really don't mean anything to me, but from what my gearheads friends have told me it was a smart buy."
"09 22, 2020",Most reliable car I've owned,"So happy I purchased this vehicle. Would highly recommend for a small family or even I single person. Plenty of leg room and cargo space. I have one in the color ""blue flame"" and it truly is a great car and very safe."

"09 10, 2020",This car rides wonderfully and has plenty of power,I really like the lane warnings and lane correction.  It is awesome to send and receive texts from the screen.  It is super comfortable and quiet.
"09 10, 2020",Really good suv,It performs very well overall with some minor setbacks. Under heavy rai the blind spot sensors might not detect an approaching vehicle. Same goes for the lane departure warning system. Other than that great ride.
"09  5, 2020",Fun car,This car met all our needs. Affordable and reliable without giving up all the bells and whistles! Plenty of room for two teenage boys in the back seat and all their stuff!
"08 31, 2020",I like this car,"After driving the Camry was by far the best . It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology."
"08 30, 2020",Favorite Car so far,"I love this car to death! I can’t ask for more. All the Amenities are there. Love the Navigation system and very friendly , welcoming you in every State you go. The drive is awesome , spacious and most of all EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURES. I feel very safe. ❤️👍"

"08 29, 2020",It's my fourth RAV 4.,"This is my fourth RAV 4.  It meets all my needs.  It is not a monster truck, it is just right.  It drives like a car."
"08 23, 2020",Regret buying a rav4,"I regret buying a rav4.  The vehicle has had a persistent rattle coming from the steering column and the dealer was unable to fix the problem.  In addition, the Bluetooth connection to an iPhone is unreliable.  Toyotas cost more than their competitors which is fine if you get superior quality but that’s not what I’m getting.  Buy a Honda instead."
"08 15, 2020",Toyota,"The car met my needs. Sporty. Like the way it drives. I am downsizing, but still enough room in the backseats. Lots of storage in the back"
"08 12, 2020",Reliable,Met my needs for driving both locally and highway.  Car has nice looks and feel.  I don't have any more comments to make  Simple car simple review
"08 12, 2020",Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,"My only concern is that I didn’t buy one sooner! It has so much room, fantastic on gas mileage and all the standard features are great."
"08 11, 2020",So far I'm very pleased!,My Rav 4 has met all my expectations since switching over from owning a Honda for many years. I have now chosen Toyota for reliability!
"08 10, 2020",I will continue tobuy this car because it reliable,This vehicle supports all of my needs. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this vehicle again when I want to trade in my leased vehicle. Larry H Miller dealership in Colorado Springs is my new favorite dealership for toyota vehicles.
"08  8, 2020",Fits like a glove feeling,"The only thing I wish would be a better take off from 0 mph to 60 mph.
The car is amazingly economical, despite its high center of gravity it does not lean at turns and behaves like a low seating Honda Accord.
It remains economical even when I I pull open trailer with the garden tractor on it!"
"08  7, 2020",Quality Vehicle,"The vehicle that I purchase exceeds all of my needs that I need to commute.  Comfortable ride, quiet and enough room to spare for passengers and cargo."
"08  6, 2020",Great car,Just purchased and already love it. So many high end features that are standard on this vehicle. You cannot beat a Toyota for value and performance!
"08  3, 2020",I feel safe in this SUV.,This SUV is well built. It is very spacious. I feel safe having my son in it  this SUV. I really like the color and the ability to be able to connect my phone to the vehicle.
"08  3, 2020",Still getting used to it.,"Although bought in February, I'm still trying to get used to certain new things that weren't on the 2014 RAV 4.  Such as the gas tank opener, which a friend had to find for me.  It's right next to the hood opener."
"08  1, 2020",Most reliable car I’ve ever purchased,"I am a very picky car shopper, I absolutely love this car I do not have any thing negative to report  . Fun to drive easy to use .  I love this rav 4"
"07 31, 2020",First new car,Love the vehicle.its smooth dependable and easy to drive with Bluetooth option because I do homecare and drive a lot! And wanted to get back into 4 wheel drive.
"07 31, 2020",I never owned a new car before,I wanted a RAV4 for several years now and I am very happy with my purchase and proud to own it. I’ve gotten May compliments on the car especially the color
"07 30, 2020",it is the perfect vehicle for me and my family,I really like this vehicle especially the new updated body type and its very comfortable interior as well. The size is perfect for me and my family.
"07 28, 2020",The 2020 RAV4 Does not Disappoint,"This SUV is spacious, drives well on both city streets, highways and dirt roads. The technology features are great and it’s not bad on gas at all! It’s not meant for anyone over 6’4” and stocky build like my husband.. But it’s a perfect fit for me! LOVE this ride!"
"07 27, 2020",RAV4 Hybrid Limited - Best RAV4 Ever,"This is my 4th RAV4 so obviously I am a fan. The hybrid has more power, more low end torque, and is just the most fun to drive of them all. Got all the bells and whistles and am enjoying the fun parts, but also appreciating the additional safety features. Thought the panoramic camera view would be just a toy but it is very useful for parking in tight places and not running over the dog. This model of RAV4 is a little longer and a little wider -- lots of room inside for the grandkid's car seats."
"07 26, 2020",Haven’t had a new car in 11 years,"This car was rated in the top 5 by Blue Book. I read several reviews before even test driving it. Performance is great, high tech and stylish. But three adults can’t fit comfortably which in the back seat, which is sad. I really wish the XLE, AWD included in the conference package or weather package self start and something very simple as a net to keep groceries and other items from moving back and forth In the cargo area."
"07 26, 2020",A++++++ Rav4 great step up!,"The car meet all our needs. I love that it has 5 usb ports, has CarPlay, the shape in front is fierce looking and a lot of trunk space."

"07 23, 2020",Dream Car,"This car as been at the top of my purchase list for over 10 years. I’m so excited to finally own this SUV. My main reason for purchasing this vehicle is for the AWD, the additional “snow”, “sand/dirt”, “rock” features are a bonus. I also love that Toyota now has standard safety features which puts my mind at ease. All the new 2020 vehicles come with Car play as well so no need to worry about being distracted while driving. The absolute “cherry on top” is the 2 year maintenance free that Toyota offers on all their new vehicles. I’m in love with my new Toyota RAV4!!"
"07 20, 2020",Best Car and Dealership,"I test drove this Rav4 LE from Romeoville Toyota. My salesman Michael was so awesome at answering all of my questions and letting me test drive this vehicle! He gave me information on everything I needed to know about the vehicle and made my experience amazing! I am so excited to go back to purchase and I will definitely be referring Romeoville Toyota and Michael to anyone looking for a new, reliable car!"

"07  3, 2020",Very good for a small suv,Great gas Mil. and being a 2020 it has a lot of features that my 2017 did  have. The safety features  that you get with toyota make it worth looking at this brand.
"06 28, 2020",Shout Out to Easton Koons Toyota,"My 2nd vehicle from Easton Koons!  Gary and Brad worked hard to make sure I was totally satisfied and to get me in this Rav4!   Gotta give Easton Toyota a visit!  You won't be disappointed.  The service has always been good over the years  as well, just an all around good choice."
"06 27, 2020",I test drove the rav4 xle,It’s a pretty nice suv but there are so many packages it will dive you crazy! To get a good rave4 with bigger wheels you got to step up to a rav4 premium and then you get more stuff like adjustable seats Partial heated steering wheel but not everyone what’s all that stuff it can get very pricey for a rav4. I’m currently looking at a Mazda witch is like 5.000 to 7.000 cheaper then a rav4 depending on the packages you want to get .
"06 25, 2020",Great Vehicle. I love that it!,I love that it can pick up and go if I need it to. There are so many helpful options that I’m not quite used to yet. I know they will be easy to learn though. I love the comfort of the seats. The back seats are comfortable as well. So far I love everything.
"06 24, 2020",Very comfortable lots of leg room,The vehicle is very comfortable alot of safety features like the console it rides smooth and quiet.  Love that i can start it from my phone.

"06 20, 2020",Very solid and good value,Plenty of space large cargo for its class. The new shape is improved than the old shape better handling and excellent safety features. Also the seats are more comfortable. The only thing a little noisy but great value
"06 19, 2020",EFFECIENT AND RELIABLE CAR,"THIS CAR PROVIDES OUR FAMILY COMFORT NEEDS IN TRAVELLING AND DRIVING EXPERIENCE. WITH ITS NAVIGATION SCREEN, USB PORTS, PROVISION OF AIR CONDITION OUTLET AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE AND ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL CONTROL OF THE AIR CONDITION AT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE . THE KEY LESS FEATURES PROVIDES EASY ACCESS, SAFETY ,COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE WHILE LOADING AND UNLOADING ITEMS."
"06 17, 2020",ALL-TIME FAVORITE CAR BY FAR....,This car is awesome. I was able to get a steal because of COVID pricing which made it all the more worth wile. I test drove 6 different SUV's prior to this buy. I'm so glad I chose the RAV. I truly enjoy driving this car. It's so smart. Everything is taken care of with lane assist and dynamic cruise control. I have AWD and its made it through 2 feet of water and up to the mountains for skiing with no problem. This car is so comfortable. We love taking road trips. I honestly have never had a car that I look forward to driving everyday. I feel like I'm 16 and I'm not kidding. When people get in they complement the car. When I pull up they compliment the car. It was a win win at 0% Financing. Toyota also gives way over ask for your trade in. Check them out. It's worth it.
"06 16, 2020",Very reliable,"This car met all my needs , practical, spacious, a lot  of new features .  I Just been driving for a week maybe i just not used to slow pickup on transmission. But over i think its reluable"

Like the light grey color match for both interior and exterior.  Owners manual is generic and seems full of warnings rather than a quick guide to perform settings, and all features mentioned (if equipped) may or may not  be included on our car."
"05 13, 2020",Wonderful 2020 Toyota RAV4,"This is our first RAV4, and we love it so far. The ride is so smooth, the look of the car inside and out is very classy. The spacing inside is very nice.

"03 13, 2020",I expect it to last just like my other Yotes.,"I opted for the XLE AWD trim for driving to trailheads when I go hiking. It is a feature packed car for the money. The tech is amazing. 

It reads road signs

It centers you on the lane, automatically following gentle curves on the highway and gently assists you if it thinks you're drifting

Turns headlights on and off, turns high beams on when there is no oncoming traffic

Can use cruise controls in stop and go traffic and turns the engine off if you're stopped waiting for lights to change.

Blindspot monitor

Alerts you if traffic is coming while you're backing up.

All LED head and tail lights means they will almost never burn out for the life of the car.

Different AWD software profiles for different surfaces.

Comes with Toyota's version of Onstar and Apple and Android interfaces.

It also has plenty of room for my gear and just the right size for a good balance of fuel economy and easy handling.

Other features I like:

Dual zone  and rear passengers AC, USB /power ports in the rear passenger and cargo areas.

Cargo cover

Factory tint

Factory rails and crossbars

And of course it is a Toyota. Might not be exciting to drive but it will soldier on for a decade or two!

The only thing I don't like is the throttle response from a stop in anything but Sport mode. So I just keep it in Sport mode!"
"03  8, 2020",Super comfortable,"Great car, easy to drive and very comfortable. Looks great too. Lots of excellent safety features. I love the ride in a Toyota. Holds the road great!"
"03  7, 2020",Smoothest car ride ever,"This SUV is bigger than our older one. Love the dark interior and overall appearance of the entire vehicle.  Smooth ride, great gas mileage.  Will definitely purchase another Rav 4 in the future."
"03  4, 2020","Great car, worth every penny.",This car far exceeded my expectations. It is really nice on the outside and inside and super gas efficient. Also it's the trd off road trim and my car is a beast!
"03  4, 2020",So far most reliable car owned!,"I had a 2015 Rav4 before and now I have a 2020 Rav4. All around this car is great!! Great on gas, reliable, rides smooth, very roomy and has alot more features. Best decision ever made to get this 2020 Rav4."
"03  3, 2020",Great Car!!,My new RAV4 runs great and is well equipped in addition to being roomy.  It has all the whistles and bells one needs.  I believe I made a good choice and am very happy with my selection.
"02 28, 2020",Awesome car to own.,I have owned a RAV4 since 2005 and will continue to buy them. It’s just what i need. The design is nice for this year more technology great automobile.
"02 26, 2020",Not a winner,"I test drove 7 SUVs while researching for a purchase.  Before I did my first test drive I thought the I'd be buying a RAV4.  After my drive of the RAV4 though I wouldn't even put it in the top 4.  The performance of the car is pretty good but the ride is very stiff and uncomfortable.  The car has a full array of safety features but their usability leaves something to be wanted.  I don't think the exterior styling is as good as the Mazda CX-5, the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape or even the Chevy Equinox.  The interior is fairly well designed and executed but not on the same level as the Forester."
"02 26, 2020",Fits my family of 4 and room for my dog.,"This is all the room I need! I wanted a car that was good on gas, awd and very roomy. My kids and dogs have planty more space, I use to have a Hyundai elantra."
"02 25, 2020",My first Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD,"I had a Nissan Maxima for 10 years and the time came to start looking for a new car. The vehicles that I test drove were Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Nissan Rogue ,  VW Tiguan and Toyota Rav 4. With the help of  Abdul Onisemoh  (Salesman at Northside Toyota, 6042 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL 60659) I decided on the Rav 4.
I made the best decision, and I give this car a 4+ out of 5 stars."
"02 25, 2020",Toyota RAV4 I am driving in Highway very  good,I think it is very good and also it is very good on the highway. The design of the car is amazing I love it.
"02 21, 2020",New purchase,"This is my first time owning a Toyota vehicle. I have had the RAV 4 for 2 days now. I enjoy how it handles, the safety features, and all the extras that come standard with the base model. I am hoping to have this SUV for many years to come!"
"02 20, 2020",Great car,"All the fit and finish Toyota is know for and some pleasant surprises that the car has. Ride is great and the interior is really nice. The engine is weak, however, I feel it is better to have mpg vs speedy acceleration."
"02 19, 2020",RAV4 XLE Permium,"Just got this car and i am loving it. Drive is smooth, power acceleration is good. ECO and Sport modes save on gas and get you moving. I love the comfort and all of the options."
"02 16, 2020",Very stylish,I like the all wheel drive and the comfort of the interior -plenty of room for the grandkids and dog.  We feel very safe driving this auto.
"02 15, 2020",Uncomfortable seating. Very noisy!,Very uncomfortable seating. I can’t imagine how it would be after a long ride. Very noisy. You have to put the radio on loud to drown out the noise.  Not many features are standard as they are on other SUV’s.  Don’t recommend it.
"02 12, 2020",My First Brand New Car Purchase for a Reason,"I've been on the market for a new vehicle for about 6 months.  I decided on the 2020 Rav4 XLE AWD because it is the total package.  There is nothing that has been overlooked regarding comfort, drive ability, safety rating, and visual aesthetic.  It is the best value for the money.  I'm a Toyota customer for life!"
"02 10, 2020",RUBY FLARE RED RAV4 LIMITED,We replaced our prior RAV4 with this vehicle due to the high safety standards and overall reliability of Toyota. Lots of bells and whistles but also driver can decide which to use and which not to use. Navigation is great.
"02  5, 2020",Very sporty looking the color is what got our atte,"We had been looking to purchase a rav4 for some time but other dealers didn't have the color in stock.
Finally we walk into Red mccombs and sure enough it was on the show room floor.."
"02  2, 2020","Only had it for two months,comfortable smooth ride","Car is great,wish it had a few features like my previous PriusV , a cup
holder for the front passenger on far right of dash, two glove boxes,
better navigation system, not this new Car Play,especially when I do not
own an I Phone. Front dash instrument pannel on Prius V is the best ever built , regardless of make of vehicle ,should be in all makes.Put
it in the RAV4"
"02  2, 2020",Don’t know if it’s a reliable car,It’s beautiful and I been driving Toyota’s for over 24 years. Never had an issue. Very good vehicles.  The RAV4 I can’t say because as I was drinking out of the sales lot the check engine light turns on.   I had to leave my brand new vehicle so it can be look into.  So sad.  Brand new and can’t drive it.
"01 30, 2020",The best car I have owned!,"This is the best car I test drove. It had more features than I expected.
It's easy to drive and comfortable and has good gas mileage.  I drove several before choosing this one."
"01 29, 2020",I own 2020 xle plug weather parget,"Pick up slow, engine a little noise, wind noise, uncomfortable with the seat too hard, Apple carplay too similar. The things I love is vehicle outside the body, interior design have some space to put the phone, coins and more, also I love the 6 different choice for the driver: Eco, Normal, Sports, Snow, Dust sand and Rock.. Love it. For my experience this vehicle suitable for the driver who loves and enjoy to drive not for racing...."
"01 20, 2020",The smoothest and most beautiful car I ever owned,This car has everything that I wanted in a car. It has more room than my previous vehicle. The car is an AWD which I love and it goes through snow like butter.
"01 19, 2020",Decent car,To slow when taking off. Its feel like it hold back. Takes a while to catch speed. Try sport n its a bot better but still laggs
"01 19, 2020",Very safe car.,I owned a RAV4 and was very satisfied but there were a few things that I was wanting to update.  My dar was 5 years old.  My new RAV4 has all the improvements that I was wanting.  Love it!
"01 14, 2020",El mas confiable que he tenido,"Este carro es el mejor que he tenido, es muy espacioso, brinda seguridad y confort, tiene 3 puertos Usb y sensores que hacen que manejes con mas seguridad."
"01  7, 2020",My family owns several different Toyota vehicle,My Rav4 2020 is a bigger feel than most smaller SUV's. Lots of extras with out the cost of most luxury cars. Lots of room!
"01  7, 2020",Toyota never disappoints!,"The 2020 Toyota Rav4 XLE is top notch! I love the increased interior space, all the new safety features (especially BSM), and the overall performance of my vehicle. I chose the white exterior, tan interior and she is a beauty! I have had several Toyotas in the past (Camry, Avalon, Rav4) and I am always pleased with the superb quality of vehicles that Toyota brings."
"01  7, 2020","Love, love my new Toyota!","I’ve wanted a Toyota for a long time . I knew when I drove it that This was the car for me ! It drives great, I’m short  and this car sits me up so that I see all areas ! This is an awesome car!"
"01  6, 2020",I love this 2020 Toyota rav4 xle,"I love this 2020 Toyota RAV4 Xle, come equip with apple car play and Android auto, run really smooth, I wish post how has mileage, my car 207 miles been at Norwalk Toyota for rattling noise and they misdiagnosed my concern"
"01  4, 2020",I knew it would be a great choice,"I went from a Prius to a RAV4. I knew I would stay with Toyota because they have always been reliable and can go hundreds of thousands of miles with little maintenance. I got the RAV4 XLE Premium because I wanted an SUV so that I would sit higher up and not scrape curbs. I also wanted leather seats. As a bonus it also has a sunroof, 19 inch wheels and tons of great safety features that make me feel very secure. I love my car and feel like it has great value for the price."
"01  3, 2020",Had one week and in the shop for repairs!,"I owned a 2017 Toyota 4Runner and I loved it! Traded it in recently for a more gas efficient RAV4. Exactly one week later in less than 500 miles on the odometer and it is in the shop. They told me it needs a new catalytic converter. It has been in the shop for over a week now!
This car is a comfortable ride however very uncomfortable to get in and out of for me anyway. The large screen blocks some view out the front window and light switches and such are difficult to locate in the dark. Just not easily accessible and very disappointed in this car overall. I bought the XLE version and the interior is not to my liking. Also Toyota is now do not come standard with floor mats. I think this is ridiculous! Brand new car should come with floor mats for goodness sakes!"
"01  3, 2020",The absolute best car I’ve ever owned,"Very spacious......very comfortable seats....smooth ride. If my hands were not on the steering wheel, I would probably think I’m in an airplane... awesome audio...beautiful blue color... an absolute joy.."
"01  3, 2020",Great vehicle,"The safety features are great, plenty of leg room, drives great and rides even better. Has emergency button to push for help, which is awesome when you have health issues."
"01  3, 2020",Great car,"The car looks great, runs great and I love all the safety features.  I would definitely recommend this suv.  I am beyond satisfied with my new vehicle."
"01  2, 2020",New 2020 Rav 4,"I turned in my 2017 Rav and found the 2020 to be totally redesigned. Its comfortable and better on gas. It's to early to tell what I really feel about it, but so far it's been great."
"01  2, 2020",Logical Car buying,This car is the first investment that I was proud to make. The resale value and quality of this car is top notch. It gets great gas mileage and has so many new features. I love the cruise control with steering assist. Complete game changer.
"01  1, 2020",Love the Toyota Rav 4,"This car has had many improvements since 2015! It has many more safety features, more comfort and is smarter than I am! Reading reviews of a car is one thing in that it is subjective. The 2020 Rav 4 is a dream!"
"01  1, 2020",Love it,"This car is perfect for Florida with safety features, gas mileage, comfort, technology, eco settings. I love the lunar rock color and new frame. Looks sleek"

"12 27, 2019",The auto breaking is an issue.,"Test drive did not charge the non hybrids car battery enough to experience the auto breaking so wasn’t till I already owned that i discovered when the auto breaking/ engine cut off and restart releases it’s jarring enough to think I’ve been rear ended.  Good thing no one was behind me I would have never guessed Toyota would release a technology this poorly designed and would have accused them of rear ending me.      Yes i can turn it off each time I start the car,  but I should not have to and of course that factors into the gas savings.  I gave up a hybrid sonata that was smooth as silk transitioning but silly me wanted to go back to Toyota."
"12 21, 2019",Great ride and love safety features.,It is a vehicle I will use every day and in inclement weather so wanted depedable AWD vehicle that will last. Also wanted the extra safety features for my daughter who is a new driver.
"12 20, 2019",Toyota Universe,I was so pleased with the great customer service and good pricing. Please do meet Koshy Thomas who was great! He helped me with my first big purchase of buying my new Toyota Rav 4. You have to visit the Toyota Universe dealership in Little Falls!

"12 10, 2019",Toyota is number one,Nothing I got everything in it I need I still don't need any thing to add to it everything is good to me you make more colors
"12  6, 2019",I prefer Toyota’s for a good reason,"This car is perfect for us. The leather seats with lumbar support on the driver’s side are very comfortable. I am short so it is great that I can pump the seat up for better visibility. The navigation screen is at eye level. This is a first for us. It is great to not have to take your eyes off of the road. The extra USB ports are wonderful. The cabin is very quiet on the road, the only exception is when you have to accelerate to merge, but acceleration doesn’t take long. I love the automatic lift gate. It is so convenient when shopping."
"11 22, 2019",Totally amazing sporty SUV Toyota 2020 XSE Hybrid,I love it The new 2020 XSE hybrid is very stylish looking excellent fuel economy about 48 on the freeway it has a 8 inch touch screen it reminds me of my I pad built in lots of room in the cabin with 4 drive modes . One of the cool things about this car is if you ever valet your car or give it to a kid or family member to borrow you can set up the parameters of the speed they’re going the miles the distance you can actually watch where the car is from your phone. Plus you can Drop the car off valet parking and we all know how they like to hot Rod peoples cars and take him on joyrides I can now set how fast that car will go and how many miles are allowed to drive it it all comes with the advanced tech package With car . Plus I can start the car anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi or the Internet and I can lock and unlock the doors if I want. There is 0 rode noise on this car . Last thing there over 3 k in profit don’t pay more than 36k for this car . My Favorite color is the blue print flame catch up
"11 21, 2019","Love all the safety features, especially RCTA",I like the rav as this is my second one. The safety features are great. Trunk area is good and also the rubber mats inside. Ride is good.
"11 19, 2019",Love it!,"Love it! Great car, comfortable, nice and easy to drive. It has great safety futures as well great convenience package.  Definitely would recommend to friends and family."
"11  5, 2019",More Than I Expected,"Soon after purchase I have taken the TRD Off Road model over 100 miles of gravel, dirt and rocky roads and climbed over 15,000 of elevation on two different trips. Tight steering radius made hairpin switchbacks easy and those short steep inclines were not noticed with the stock Falken Wildpeak AT tires and the setting Normal ""Rock and Sand"". Great gas mileage driving all the time in the Sport Mode when not off road. Spacious and comfortable inside. Great car Toyota !!!"
"10 13, 2019",2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited Review,"Perennially a best-selling SUV, the RAV4 can be had in a wide range of iterations, so it’s no wonder it’s so popular. Price-Leader LE models are pretty basic, but an available hybrid Powertrain Control is compelling. High-end Limited models can challenge the Lexus NX with their many luxury features and a new TRD off-road model promises enhanced capacity as they hit the trails. Its robust styling makes it look right at home with the Toyota 4Runner SUV and Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. Driving dynamics tend toward the mundane side of the spectrum, but most consumers will find the 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid’s ride comfortable and its handling comfortable. Adult passengers will also be pleased with Toyota’s generous legroom in both front and rear seats; Cargo Room is also competitive with the best in the segment.

2020 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID LIMITED REVIEW
Toyota introduces the TRD off-road model for 2020, which comes with unique 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a TRD off-road suspension kit with red Coil springs, and lots of TRD logos ear tags interior and exterior. Elsewhere in the lineup, Android Auto capability becomes a standard feature as does SiriusXM satellite radio; The XLE models now come with a Power-adjustable driver’s seat, but lose the standard moonroof, which becomes part of the optional convenience package. The mid-range Adventure model gets a leather wrapped steering wheel and Shift knob, but the Power Lift Gate model is now optional. Limited trims now come with the premium JBL sound system as standard.

"05 18, 2024",bought this vehicle new.,"bought this vehicle new. in & out for repairs....parts keep breaking or burning out. last repair $1700, electric break control issue. defective part.
prior another defective part $825...this one I argued with Toyota & got them to reimburse me. 
always had honda/ acuras. never any major problems over 20 years."
"10 29, 2023",Very happy with my purchase,After purchase I immediately took the car on an 800 mile road trip. It is much more comfortable and rides more smoothly than our older RAV4 and had plenty of pep for highway driving. Averaged over 37 MPG at highway speed of 70-80 MPH. Would have liked a power hatchback but overall I’m very satisfied with the options that came with it as an LE model.
"10 22, 2023",Not worth the money.,I bought a 2020 Rav 4 it has been in the shop more then anything. Always some with voltage and power steering.  Computer updates. I have sank more money into repairs then anything else. Not reliable or dependable for what I paid for the vehicle.
"10  9, 2023",toyota get in the game,no matter how basic a car the ability to open your garage door should be standard.  rav4 LE strips too many basic needs.  toyota stop being cheap get in the game
"06  9, 2023",Going Places,"Definition of practical while being affordable. All the bad reviews are because the geniuses who purchases them did no research. Auto Off engine kills your battery life, leaving it off is perfect. Packed with safety features, you want your kids in this car 100%. 28 mpg in the city and 35+ in 55 MPH zones. I get 38 mpg highway normally. Sure you can pay $35k+ for a hybrid, but this is well engineered already."
"05 24, 2023",Rav 4 2020,"2020 rav4 engine maintenance and they say is valve..$600 that is crazy..

Do not buy rav4 they say all rav 4 have this issue but it is not a recall.."
"02 11, 2023",Rav4 Battery dead at 2.5 years,"Car would not start at 25500 miles and 2.5 years.   Battery completely dead.  Trying to get battery recharged.  We drive car regularly, so there is NO reason for battery to be dead. 
Horrible situation to find car want start after only 2.5 years.
Checking on a used Honda."
"12 17, 2022",Highly Recommend,"We just bought a 2020 Rav4 LE as a Toyota Certified car with 21,500 miles.  We downsized (literally) from a 20 year old Sequoia, so we're getting accustomed to the smaller size.  My only complaint is that the cup holders seem to be a bit awkward.  I love the design and the all of the safety features and the handling while driving."
"11 14, 2022",Re: Rav 4 purchase,"I had a great experience when purchasing my new car. The says rep at Toyota of Lincoln Park, Edgar Rivera was extremely knowledgeable and professional."
"09 27, 2022",a little bit expensive but worthy,only concern I have is the tire pressure sensor(s) are a little bit sensitive.  This including the spare tire carried its own sensor. You only used spare tire once a while not daily.  quality is good. no CVT transmission problems for Adventure model. The 4 wheels drive for adventure is amazing drove in heavy rain Floody conditions without a scratch (which Forester and CRV were parking on roadside cannot move)
"09  8, 2022",Not as good as U think,Rough suspension and way too much road noise. Getting in and out will be more difficult for tall or long legged people as you sit very low even with drivers seat elevated. Radio is probably the best part of this vehicle as it has lots of tunable settings and good volume for those who like it loud. Windows fog up bad and take too long to clear when parked. Does not heat up fast like a V-8 does. Gas mileage is about half what is advertised and that is not good. Overall I couldn't get to a good review on this. 3.5/5 at best.
"09  2, 2022",Viva de milagro.,"RAVA 4 2020…frenos fallaron y aceleró grandemente. Se llenó de humo blanco…
Paramos en una cuneta en construcción perdida total… vivos de milagro.
15 meses de uso. TERRIBLE!!!"
"04 25, 2022",Love our Rav!!,"Virtually nothing has gone wrong with my 2020 RAV4. I have a small bit of buyer remorse, because wear hearing aids and there is a lot of road noise in my Rav. The Venza model turns out to be more luxurious and is much quieter. But, it has trade offs, as well. I might have gone with that, had I known. But the Rav is a great vehicle, no actual regrets. Lots of power when one needs it. And the breaking system kept me out of an accident, several months ago, the brakes went on when someone pulled out in front of me from a side road. I was not looking in that direction, and never would have braked soon enough. We recently went on a road trip from Washington state to Southern California and we’re delighted when we got 42 MPG. Great car, no regrets, maybe I’ll take it somewhere for some soundproofing."
"04  8, 2022","Old is gold, very reliable","I inherited this car from my grandmother, she bought it new in 2000 and barely ever drove it, so it was in great condition when I ended up getting it back in 2014. I've put about 50,000 miles on it between work, high school, and college. I love this little car, it's never given me an issue and is more reliable than some of my friends' cars from 2010 or newer. The interior leaves a bit to be desired; it's comfortable but the design of the dashboard isn't great and the cupholders are basically useless and get in the way of the gear changer. Well, back in y2k drinks weren't as big as they are now so I can hardly blame them, but it does still suck when I go to put my car in park and the stick won't even go all the way forward because my water bottle is blocking it. The paint coat was excellent and has only just recently (about 2019ish) began to oxidize and peel its topcoat. The SUV style isn't for everyone, but I like roomy, boxy cars like this one. One thing I REALLY appreciate is how quickly the AC and heating kick in. Being from south California, I need the AC to come on as quickly as possible in the hot summer, and my RAV4 is cooled down by the time I leave my driveway. This car has 129,000 miles on it, and I think I can take it for another 80,000 at least. It doesn't come with all the bells and whistles of a newer car with heated seats and electric door locks, but for its time it is more than a wonderful car, and I'll be sticking with Toyota for my next car as well."
"04  2, 2022",It was not a new car it had 300 hundred miles and,I traded 2 cars for this Rava 4 had 300.00 miles and they sold it to me for a New Car but it was not a new car with that many miles I will not buy another Toyota SUV from Sparks Toyota At Myrtle beach I was sick and I tole them I did not feel like messing with it but they pressure me in getting and I told them over and over that I did not feel like trading and they kept on and on they just done me wrong they should pay me for putting me thru all that stuff it was not right so what can I do about that let me know something thank
"03 24, 2021",A reliable car that's made very well,"I enjoy the car, going on long trips to Connecticut to visit my grandchildren never have to worry, I have told my friends about the RAV4 and two of them have bought it and are very happy"
"03 23, 2021",most reliable car I've owned,"This is the second Toyota I have owned. the first one being a 1989 Camry. it was my favorite car I have owned until now. I love Toyotas. they are reliable and comfortable. this car is no different, with the added bonus of being modern and having all the cool technology. I don't know how I lived with out Apple Car Play, before now. its a game changer. the seats in my  2020 XLE are what sold me. they are cloth and super comfortable. there is space for our family of four, without feeling like I am driving a bus. This SUV is perfect for us!"
"02 23, 2021",Smartphone,This car Quality is very good and this is a nice car. I love this car. Anyone can buy it at an affordable price. Thank you for sharing with us.
"02  4, 2021","Very Comfortable, smooth ride, and rekuable",I like sitting up higher and having a better view of the rode. It has comfortable seating and an easy to manage control panel. It is economical in terms of gas and oil
"01 31, 2021",I'm always be happy to have a Toyota as my car,"For me , Toyota is  the most best of the cars everyone should have for their family.  it's an economic car ,  it saves fuel  and it's a fighter vehicle."
"01 30, 2021",Best AWD SUV!,"Comfortable, best handling in the elements, Toyota reliability, all the features, great gas mileage, large trunk space. Only drawback to the XLE model is no sunroof and no power lift gate."
"01 24, 2021",Best Toyota so far,I absolutely love this car. I basically traded in my Toyotas every three years and I’ve had just about every model and this RAV4 is the most unbelievable car I’ve had I love it and definitely will get another one
"01  2, 2021",Least reliable car I have ever owned,"My 2020 Rav4 Hybrid has three major issues since purchased in August 2020. One, stalling, remains unresolved despite several attempts of the dealer to find the cause. Apparently many others have the same issue.
Another, 12v battery discharge due to heavy demand from various options, causes voltage levels to drop below that needed to start the car. A software fix and my taking initiative to deselect options such as automatic parking reduced demand on the battery. But the less-tna-full-size battery is an issue.  
A third issue, issues related to filling and pumping fuel from a redesigned gas tank, caused a lot of anxiety but has apparently been fixed.
Toyota's response has been less than I would expect given the widespread occurance of these issues.  Buyers were NOT advise of these issue when purchasing. Dealers service dept often expressed lack of awareness of the issues.
I do NOT recommend this car."
"12 30, 2020",Tbis was an Awesome purchase for my family,"This car is perfect for my family, we're enjoying the performance and room of the car. We took a trip a the ride was wonderful."
"12 22, 2020",Just bought it  So far I am happy but Give me time,"So Far I like it very much,  it is responsive. But since I have driven it for only 2 days i need l little more time to evaluate"
"12 18, 2020",Toyota RAV4,"This vehicle is really superb. It’s everything you need in a car. Hoping this last just like my Toyota Camry 06 model which I drove for 305,000 miles."
"12 16, 2020",issued,"paint not good and .
i wont buy toyota again the dealers when you come back them treat you very bad i will try next time another brand"
"12 15, 2020",I purchased a 2020 Rav 4 in February 2020 -,I've had nothing but problems out of this vehicle.  My dealership has replaced the battery 2 times - Spring and Winter 2020 - because something in this vehicle keeps depleting the battery.
"12  9, 2020",Fifth RAV4,"This is our 6th RAV 4 since 2009 under the lease program, not that previous RAVs have had issues but it's nice to drive a new car every few years and not have to worry about maintenance."
"11 29, 2020",RAV4 is a very comfortable easy to use vehicle tha,Vehicle had all the options that we could Asfoor to keep our daughter safe and with Toyota dependability and value what else can I say
"11 14, 2020",Love my car!,"My last car was a Nissan Sentra (never again Nissan). Last winter it got stuck in a quarter inch of snow on the tiniest incline in a parking lot. That’s when I knew I needed an SUV. Toyotas have always been reliable cars to me, and the new style of the RAV4 caught my eye, and I just knew I needed this car. Got a white XLE with all the bells and whistles. Heated seats and steering wheel, moonroof, premium sound system, power everything, push button start, etc. I love how it drives, super smooth and powerful for a 4-cylinder! I average about 28 miles to the gallon, and the Toyota Connect package is awesome! I can lock/unlock my doors, start my car remotely, and check the status of my car through the app! So cool! Also offers Wifi hotspot which has been good for my kids going on their virtual classrooms as we drive. Can’t wait to see what it can do in snow!"
"10 23, 2020",xxx Not good,"Never buy Toyota 
Should have gone with another manufacturer as nothing but problems which have not been repaired and not taken seriously by dealership as of now"
"10 21, 2020",Best Purchase!,"I am absolutely obsessed with my new Rav4! I previously owned a 2007 model and new when it was time to upgrade, I was going to stick with another Rav. The 2020 model is the best purchase I could have made, I am extremely thrilled and excited about it. Performance and reliability are so far a 100% in my book! I was at first apprehensive about the tire not being on the back any longer, as to me - that's what made the Rav stand out, but with the 2020, I love the new look of the body."
"10 21, 2020",Most comfortable vehicle I own,"This vehicle meets all my needs. The cabin is roomy with ample leg room. This by far the most comfortable vehicle I have owned for long road trips. The blind spot monitor, back up camera and pre-collision system make this vehicle a truly safe, comfortable ride."
"10 20, 2020",2020 RAV4 Limited AWD,"We have driven a 2007 RAV4 limited AWD for almost 14 years.  It has been virtually trouble free so it was a no brainer to get the same car for the CEO (wife).  Have only driven it for a few hundred miles but the following stand out so far...

1.  Seating comfort is very good.
2.  The A/C makes it cold enough to hang meat inside the car.
3.  Pretty sporty looking for an SUV.
4.  So much info on the dash it will take some time to learn all of the functions.
5.  The addition of a trailer hitch for the bike rack virtually disables the ""Kick sensor"" for closing the back hatch.

Because of the short time of ownership, I cannot speak on the longevity or reliability of the car.   So far, so good and time will tell if this lives up to the reliability of our 2007 RAV4.  This survey makes you put in a rating for reliability"
"10 20, 2020",I love my suv,I'm greatly satisfied with my SUV. My salesman was very professional and showed me all about my new suv. I couldn't be more satisfied with it
"10 20, 2020",Best vehicle  I  have  every  owned.,"It's  beautiful  inside, lots of room. Safety  features  amazed me for the price I paid. All the features are easy to set. The ignition is  a little tricky  for me but I  am sure I  will adjust."
"10  8, 2020","Great Car, Last Toyota I will ever buy","Great Cars, Terrible People, dealer made buying a car worst than going to Dentist. Dealers sales Manager tried to chest bump me,A real Bully
Salesman turned out to be coward and disappeared"
"10  5, 2020",Lots of safety options in entry level car,We bought a new RAV4 for our oldest daughter and feel it’s the perfect car for her and our family. Not too small not too big and has a lot of safety features which will help a young driver. Toyotas are safe and dependable cars!

"09 30, 2020",Good looking vehicle.  Comfortable,"This car met all my needs.  Safety on the highway and added safety in extreme winter conditions.  Comfortable enough for an 8 hour drive on   highway,  crossing from state to state.   Good cruise control, as well as good navigation features and ease of audio use.   Room in the cargo  area for my golf bag and weekend bag."
"09 30, 2020","heard and read, now own","This car has plenty of leg room in the  front and esp in the back.  We were looking for a bigger space in the back for a medium dog cage to fit. The ride is quiet and the phone sounds nice thru blue tooth. Im not a music fan so anything will do, but the music sounds great with the system. I love the thick car matts that came with the vehicle and looking forward to testing out all the options."
"09 30, 2020",Feel safe in my vehicle,"This meets all my needs and has more features than I was looking for, but ones that I  very much enjoy. I am a happy person driving my RAV4."
"09 25, 2020",Traded a Honda for a Toyota,"I have only had it for 1 week, but I really like it. It is very stylish. Will need to add a few accessories and more window tint"
"09 24, 2020",Best ever,This car meets all my needs and more. I would recommend for anyone. Very nice to drive. Love the color. Lunar Rock !! Great gas mileage.
"09 24, 2020",Excellent buy,"Perfect car for working class family, it has everything you need and more, safe, reliable, best value I ever had, I ready recommended for any body, you will not be desapointed, I love it."
"09 23, 2020",It's an upgrade to me,"Went from a 2018 to the 2020 model and I like it. I'm not a big car guy so the feature really don't mean anything to me, but from what my gearheads friends have told me it was a smart buy."
"09 22, 2020",Most reliable car I've owned,"So happy I purchased this vehicle. Would highly recommend for a small family or even I single person. Plenty of leg room and cargo space. I have one in the color ""blue flame"" and it truly is a great car and very safe."

"09 10, 2020",This car rides wonderfully and has plenty of power,I really like the lane warnings and lane correction.  It is awesome to send and receive texts from the screen.  It is super comfortable and quiet.
"09 10, 2020",Really good suv,It performs very well overall with some minor setbacks. Under heavy rai the blind spot sensors might not detect an approaching vehicle. Same goes for the lane departure warning system. Other than that great ride.
"09  5, 2020",Fun car,This car met all our needs. Affordable and reliable without giving up all the bells and whistles! Plenty of room for two teenage boys in the back seat and all their stuff!
"08 31, 2020",I like this car,"After driving the Camry was by far the best . It is solidly built, quiet, and smooth. The ride is like. It's just the right size, has very comfortable seats and is loaded with technology."
"08 30, 2020",Favorite Car so far,"I love this car to death! I can’t ask for more. All the Amenities are there. Love the Navigation system and very friendly , welcoming you in every State you go. The drive is awesome , spacious and most of all EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURES. I feel very safe. ❤️👍"

"08 29, 2020",It's my fourth RAV 4.,"This is my fourth RAV 4.  It meets all my needs.  It is not a monster truck, it is just right.  It drives like a car."
"08 23, 2020",Regret buying a rav4,"I regret buying a rav4.  The vehicle has had a persistent rattle coming from the steering column and the dealer was unable to fix the problem.  In addition, the Bluetooth connection to an iPhone is unreliable.  Toyotas cost more than their competitors which is fine if you get superior quality but that’s not what I’m getting.  Buy a Honda instead."
"08 15, 2020",Toyota,"The car met my needs. Sporty. Like the way it drives. I am downsizing, but still enough room in the backseats. Lots of storage in the back"
"08 12, 2020",Reliable,Met my needs for driving both locally and highway.  Car has nice looks and feel.  I don't have any more comments to make  Simple car simple review
"08 12, 2020",Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,"My only concern is that I didn’t buy one sooner! It has so much room, fantastic on gas mileage and all the standard features are great."
"08 11, 2020",So far I'm very pleased!,My Rav 4 has met all my expectations since switching over from owning a Honda for many years. I have now chosen Toyota for reliability!
"08 10, 2020",I will continue tobuy this car because it reliable,This vehicle supports all of my needs. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this vehicle again when I want to trade in my leased vehicle. Larry H Miller dealership in Colorado Springs is my new favorite dealership for toyota vehicles.
"08  8, 2020",Fits like a glove feeling,"The only thing I wish would be a better take off from 0 mph to 60 mph.
The car is amazingly economical, despite its high center of gravity it does not lean at turns and behaves like a low seating Honda Accord.
It remains economical even when I I pull open trailer with the garden tractor on it!"
"08  7, 2020",Quality Vehicle,"The vehicle that I purchase exceeds all of my needs that I need to commute.  Comfortable ride, quiet and enough room to spare for passengers and cargo."
"08  6, 2020",Great car,Just purchased and already love it. So many high end features that are standard on this vehicle. You cannot beat a Toyota for value and performance!
"08  3, 2020",I feel safe in this SUV.,This SUV is well built. It is very spacious. I feel safe having my son in it  this SUV. I really like the color and the ability to be able to connect my phone to the vehicle.
"08  3, 2020",Still getting used to it.,"Although bought in February, I'm still trying to get used to certain new things that weren't on the 2014 RAV 4.  Such as the gas tank opener, which a friend had to find for me.  It's right next to the hood opener."
"08  1, 2020",Most reliable car I’ve ever purchased,"I am a very picky car shopper, I absolutely love this car I do not have any thing negative to report  . Fun to drive easy to use .  I love this rav 4"
"07 31, 2020",First new car,Love the vehicle.its smooth dependable and easy to drive with Bluetooth option because I do homecare and drive a lot! And wanted to get back into 4 wheel drive.
"07 31, 2020",I never owned a new car before,I wanted a RAV4 for several years now and I am very happy with my purchase and proud to own it. I’ve gotten May compliments on the car especially the color
"07 30, 2020",it is the perfect vehicle for me and my family,I really like this vehicle especially the new updated body type and its very comfortable interior as well. The size is perfect for me and my family.
"07 28, 2020",The 2020 RAV4 Does not Disappoint,"This SUV is spacious, drives well on both city streets, highways and dirt roads. The technology features are great and it’s not bad on gas at all! It’s not meant for anyone over 6’4” and stocky build like my husband.. But it’s a perfect fit for me! LOVE this ride!"
"07 27, 2020",RAV4 Hybrid Limited - Best RAV4 Ever,"This is my 4th RAV4 so obviously I am a fan. The hybrid has more power, more low end torque, and is just the most fun to drive of them all. Got all the bells and whistles and am enjoying the fun parts, but also appreciating the additional safety features. Thought the panoramic camera view would be just a toy but it is very useful for parking in tight places and not running over the dog. This model of RAV4 is a little longer and a little wider -- lots of room inside for the grandkid's car seats."
"07 26, 2020",Haven’t had a new car in 11 years,"This car was rated in the top 5 by Blue Book. I read several reviews before even test driving it. Performance is great, high tech and stylish. But three adults can’t fit comfortably which in the back seat, which is sad. I really wish the XLE, AWD included in the conference package or weather package self start and something very simple as a net to keep groceries and other items from moving back and forth In the cargo area."
"07 26, 2020",A++++++ Rav4 great step up!,"The car meet all our needs. I love that it has 5 usb ports, has CarPlay, the shape in front is fierce looking and a lot of trunk space."
"07 24, 2020",Great car,love the speed that this car delivers. Great gas mileage. It is what I have been looking for in a hybrid Car. Rav4 Limited Red
"07 23, 2020",Dream Car,"This car as been at the top of my purchase list for over 10 years. I’m so excited to finally own this SUV. My main reason for purchasing this vehicle is for the AWD, the additional “snow”, “sand/dirt”, “rock” features are a bonus. I also love that Toyota now has standard safety features which puts my mind at ease. All the new 2020 vehicles come with Car play as well so no need to worry about being distracted while driving. The absolute “cherry on top” is the 2 year maintenance free that Toyota offers on all their new vehicles. I’m in love with my new Toyota RAV4!!"
"07 20, 2020",Best Car and Dealership,"I test drove this Rav4 LE from Romeoville Toyota. My salesman Michael was so awesome at answering all of my questions and letting me test drive this vehicle! He gave me information on everything I needed to know about the vehicle and made my experience amazing! I am so excited to go back to purchase and I will definitely be referring Romeoville Toyota and Michael to anyone looking for a new, reliable car!"
"07 18, 2020",Amazing new design,Beautiful new design  I have the adventure trim which can tow more than the base model and we look forward to using for camping and our bikes
"07  3, 2020",Very good for a small suv,Great gas Mil. and being a 2020 it has a lot of features that my 2017 did  have. The safety features  that you get with toyota make it worth looking at this brand.
"06 28, 2020",Shout Out to Easton Koons Toyota,"My 2nd vehicle from Easton Koons!  Gary and Brad worked hard to make sure I was totally satisfied and to get me in this Rav4!   Gotta give Easton Toyota a visit!  You won't be disappointed.  The service has always been good over the years  as well, just an all around good choice."
"06 27, 2020",I test drove the rav4 xle,It’s a pretty nice suv but there are so many packages it will dive you crazy! To get a good rave4 with bigger wheels you got to step up to a rav4 premium and then you get more stuff like adjustable seats Partial heated steering wheel but not everyone what’s all that stuff it can get very pricey for a rav4. I’m currently looking at a Mazda witch is like 5.000 to 7.000 cheaper then a rav4 depending on the packages you want to get .
"06 25, 2020",Great Vehicle. I love that it!,I love that it can pick up and go if I need it to. There are so many helpful options that I’m not quite used to yet. I know they will be easy to learn though. I love the comfort of the seats. The back seats are comfortable as well. So far I love everything.
"06 24, 2020",Very comfortable lots of leg room,The vehicle is very comfortable alot of safety features like the console it rides smooth and quiet.  Love that i can start it from my phone.
"06 23, 2020",Great reliable suv !,This car has met all my needs and more. The technology is beyond great!! The new body style is what sold me. I am really enjoying the new 2020 Rav4.
"06 22, 2020",My dream car.,This vehicle more than meets my expectations. I have enjoyed the comfortable quiet drive. It looks awesome and I am proud to own it. Looking forward to my next road trip.
"06 22, 2020",simple the best value!,"Good looking,good price, fuel efficient and my family love it. It is simply the best value on the road. It’s size, it’s looks, gas mileage and dependability makes it the best Toyota model on the road."

"06 17, 2020",ALL-TIME FAVORITE CAR BY FAR....,This car is awesome. I was able to get a steal because of COVID pricing which made it all the more worth wile. I test drove 6 different SUV's prior to this buy. I'm so glad I chose the RAV. I truly enjoy driving this car. It's so smart. Everything is taken care of with lane assist and dynamic cruise control. I have AWD and its made it through 2 feet of water and up to the mountains for skiing with no problem. This car is so comfortable. We love taking road trips. I honestly have never had a car that I look forward to driving everyday. I feel like I'm 16 and I'm not kidding. When people get in they complement the car. When I pull up they compliment the car. It was a win win at 0% Financing. Toyota also gives way over ask for your trade in. Check them out. It's worth it.
"06 16, 2020",Very reliable,"This car met all my needs , practical, spacious, a lot  of new features .  I Just been driving for a week maybe i just not used to slow pickup on transmission. But over i think its reluable"

Like the light grey color match for both interior and exterior.  Owners manual is generic and seems full of warnings rather than a quick guide to perform settings, and all features mentioned (if equipped) may or may not  be included on our car."
"05 13, 2020",Wonderful 2020 Toyota RAV4,"This is our first RAV4, and we love it so far. The ride is so smooth, the look of the car inside and out is very classy. The spacing inside is very nice.

"03 13, 2020",I expect it to last just like my other Yotes.,"I opted for the XLE AWD trim for driving to trailheads when I go hiking. It is a feature packed car for the money. The tech is amazing. 

It reads road signs

It centers you on the lane, automatically following gentle curves on the highway and gently assists you if it thinks you're drifting

Turns headlights on and off, turns high beams on when there is no oncoming traffic

Can use cruise controls in stop and go traffic and turns the engine off if you're stopped waiting for lights to change.

Blindspot monitor

Alerts you if traffic is coming while you're backing up.

All LED head and tail lights means they will almost never burn out for the life of the car.

Different AWD software profiles for different surfaces.

Comes with Toyota's version of Onstar and Apple and Android interfaces.

It also has plenty of room for my gear and just the right size for a good balance of fuel economy and easy handling.

Other features I like:

Dual zone  and rear passengers AC, USB /power ports in the rear passenger and cargo areas.

Cargo cover

Factory tint

Factory rails and crossbars

And of course it is a Toyota. Might not be exciting to drive but it will soldier on for a decade or two!

The only thing I don't like is the throttle response from a stop in anything but Sport mode. So I just keep it in Sport mode!"
"03  8, 2020",Super comfortable,"Great car, easy to drive and very comfortable. Looks great too. Lots of excellent safety features. I love the ride in a Toyota. Holds the road great!"

"03  3, 2020",Great Car!!,My new RAV4 runs great and is well equipped in addition to being roomy.  It has all the whistles and bells one needs.  I believe I made a good choice and am very happy with my selection.
"02 28, 2020",Awesome car to own.,I have owned a RAV4 since 2005 and will continue to buy them. It’s just what i need. The design is nice for this year more technology great automobile.
"02 26, 2020",Not a winner,"I test drove 7 SUVs while researching for a purchase.  Before I did my first test drive I thought the I'd be buying a RAV4.  After my drive of the RAV4 though I wouldn't even put it in the top 4.  The performance of the car is pretty good but the ride is very stiff and uncomfortable.  The car has a full array of safety features but their usability leaves something to be wanted.  I don't think the exterior styling is as good as the Mazda CX-5, the Subaru Forester, the Ford Escape or even the Chevy Equinox.  The interior is fairly well designed and executed but not on the same level as the Forester."
"02 26, 2020",Fits my family of 4 and room for my dog.,"This is all the room I need! I wanted a car that was good on gas, awd and very roomy. My kids and dogs have planty more space, I use to have a Hyundai elantra."
"02 25, 2020",My first Toyota Rav 4 XLE AWD,"I had a Nissan Maxima for 10 years and the time came to start looking for a new car. The vehicles that I test drove were Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Nissan Rogue ,  VW Tiguan and Toyota Rav 4. With the help of  Abdul Onisemoh  (Salesman at Northside Toyota, 6042 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL 60659) I decided on the Rav 4.
I made the best decision, and I give this car a 4+ out of 5 stars."
"02 25, 2020",Toyota RAV4 I am driving in Highway very  good,I think it is very good and also it is very good on the highway. The design of the car is amazing I love it.
"02 21, 2020",New purchase,"This is my first time owning a Toyota vehicle. I have had the RAV 4 for 2 days now. I enjoy how it handles, the safety features, and all the extras that come standard with the base model. I am hoping to have this SUV for many years to come!"
"02 20, 2020",Great car,"All the fit and finish Toyota is know for and some pleasant surprises that the car has. Ride is great and the interior is really nice. The engine is weak, however, I feel it is better to have mpg vs speedy acceleration."
"02 19, 2020",RAV4 XLE Permium,"Just got this car and i am loving it. Drive is smooth, power acceleration is good. ECO and Sport modes save on gas and get you moving. I love the comfort and all of the options."
"02 16, 2020",Very stylish,I like the all wheel drive and the comfort of the interior -plenty of room for the grandkids and dog.  We feel very safe driving this auto.
"02 15, 2020",Uncomfortable seating. Very noisy!,Very uncomfortable seating. I can’t imagine how it would be after a long ride. Very noisy. You have to put the radio on loud to drown out the noise.  Not many features are standard as they are on other SUV’s.  Don’t recommend it.
"02 12, 2020",My First Brand New Car Purchase for a Reason,"I've been on the market for a new vehicle for about 6 months.  I decided on the 2020 Rav4 XLE AWD because it is the total package.  There is nothing that has been overlooked regarding comfort, drive ability, safety rating, and visual aesthetic.  It is the best value for the money.  I'm a Toyota customer for life!"
"02 10, 2020",RUBY FLARE RED RAV4 LIMITED,We replaced our prior RAV4 with this vehicle due to the high safety standards and overall reliability of Toyota. Lots of bells and whistles but also driver can decide which to use and which not to use. Navigation is great.
"02  5, 2020",Very sporty looking the color is what got our atte,"We had been looking to purchase a rav4 for some time but other dealers didn't have the color in stock.
Finally we walk into Red mccombs and sure enough it was on the show room floor.."
"02  2, 2020","Only had it for two months,comfortable smooth ride","Car is great,wish it had a few features like my previous PriusV , a cup
holder for the front passenger on far right of dash, two glove boxes,
better navigation system, not this new Car Play,especially when I do not
own an I Phone. Front dash instrument pannel on Prius V is the best ever built , regardless of make of vehicle ,should be in all makes.Put
it in the RAV4"
"02  2, 2020",Don’t know if it’s a reliable car,It’s beautiful and I been driving Toyota’s for over 24 years. Never had an issue. Very good vehicles.  The RAV4 I can’t say because as I was drinking out of the sales lot the check engine light turns on.   I had to leave my brand new vehicle so it can be look into.  So sad.  Brand new and can’t drive it.
"01 30, 2020",The best car I have owned!,"This is the best car I test drove. It had more features than I expected.
It's easy to drive and comfortable and has good gas mileage.  I drove several before choosing this one."
"01 29, 2020",I own 2020 xle plug weather parget,"Pick up slow, engine a little noise, wind noise, uncomfortable with the seat too hard, Apple carplay too similar. The things I love is vehicle outside the body, interior design have some space to put the phone, coins and more, also I love the 6 different choice for the driver: Eco, Normal, Sports, Snow, Dust sand and Rock.. Love it. For my experience this vehicle suitable for the driver who loves and enjoy to drive not for racing...."
"01 20, 2020",The smoothest and most beautiful car I ever owned,This car has everything that I wanted in a car. It has more room than my previous vehicle. The car is an AWD which I love and it goes through snow like butter.
"01 19, 2020",Decent car,To slow when taking off. Its feel like it hold back. Takes a while to catch speed. Try sport n its a bot better but still laggs
"01 19, 2020",Very safe car.,I owned a RAV4 and was very satisfied but there were a few things that I was wanting to update.  My dar was 5 years old.  My new RAV4 has all the improvements that I was wanting.  Love it!
"01 14, 2020",El mas confiable que he tenido,"Este carro es el mejor que he tenido, es muy espacioso, brinda seguridad y confort, tiene 3 puertos Usb y sensores que hacen que manejes con mas seguridad."
"01  7, 2020",My family owns several different Toyota vehicle,My Rav4 2020 is a bigger feel than most smaller SUV's. Lots of extras with out the cost of most luxury cars. Lots of room!
"01  7, 2020",Toyota never disappoints!,"The 2020 Toyota Rav4 XLE is top notch! I love the increased interior space, all the new safety features (especially BSM), and the overall performance of my vehicle. I chose the white exterior, tan interior and she is a beauty!

"01  4, 2020",I knew it would be a great choice,"I went from a Prius to a RAV4. I knew I would stay with Toyota because they have always been reliable and can go hundreds of thousands of miles with little maintenance. I got the RAV4 XLE Premium because I wanted an SUV so that I would sit higher up and not scrape curbs. I also wanted leather seats. As a bonus it also has a sunroof, 19 inch wheels and tons of great safety features that make me feel very secure. I love my car and feel like it has great value for the price."
"01  3, 2020",Had one week and in the shop for repairs!,"I owned a 2017 Toyota 4Runner and I loved it! Traded it in recently for a more gas efficient RAV4. Exactly one week later in less than 500 miles on the odometer and it is in the shop. They told me it needs a new catalytic converter. It has been in the shop for over a week now!
This car is a comfortable ride however very uncomfortable to get in and out of for me anyway. The large screen blocks some view out the front window and light switches and such are difficult to locate in the dark. Just not easily accessible and very disappointed in this car overall. I bought the XLE version and the interior is not to my liking. Also Toyota is now do not come standard with floor mats. I think this is ridiculous! Brand new car should come with floor mats for goodness sakes!"
"01  3, 2020",The absolute best car I’ve ever owned,"Very spacious......very comfortable seats....smooth ride. If my hands were not on the steering wheel, I would probably think I’m in an airplane... awesome audio...beautiful blue color... an absolute joy.."

"01  3, 2020",Great car,"The car looks great, runs great and I love all the safety features.  I would definitely recommend this suv.  I am beyond satisfied with my new vehicle."
"01  2, 2020",New 2020 Rav 4,"I turned in my 2017 Rav and found the 2020 to be totally redesigned. Its comfortable and better on gas. It's to early to tell what I really feel about it, but so far it's been great."
"01  2, 2020",Logical Car buying,This car is the first investment that I was proud to make. The resale value and quality of this car is top notch. It gets great gas mileage and has so many new features. I love the cruise control with steering assist. Complete game changer.
"01  1, 2020",Love the Toyota Rav 4,"This car has had many improvements since 2015! It has many more safety features, more comfort and is smarter than I am! Reading reviews of a car is one thing in that it is subjective. The 2020 Rav 4 is a dream!"
"01  1, 2020",Love it,"This car is perfect for Florida with safety features, gas mileage, comfort, technology, eco settings. I love the lunar rock color and new frame. Looks sleek"

"12 27, 2019",The auto breaking is an issue.,"Test drive did not charge the non hybrids car battery enough to experience the auto breaking so wasn’t till I already owned that i discovered when the auto breaking/ engine cut off and restart releases it’s jarring enough to think I’ve been rear ended.  Good thing no one was behind me I would have never guessed Toyota would release a technology this poorly designed and would have accused them of rear ending me.      Yes i can turn it off each time I start the car,  but I should not have to and of course that factors into the gas savings.  I gave up a hybrid sonata that was smooth as silk transitioning but silly me wanted to go back to Toyota."
"12 21, 2019",Great ride and love safety features.,It is a vehicle I will use every day and in inclement weather so wanted depedable AWD vehicle that will last. Also wanted the extra safety features for my daughter who is a new driver.
"12 20, 2019",Toyota Universe,I was so pleased with the great customer service and good pricing. Please do meet Koshy Thomas who was great! He helped me with my first big purchase of buying my new Toyota Rav 4. You have to visit the Toyota Universe dealership in Little Falls!

"12 10, 2019",Toyota is number one,Nothing I got everything in it I need I still don't need any thing to add to it everything is good to me you make more colors
"12  6, 2019",I prefer Toyota’s for a good reason,"This car is perfect for us. The leather seats with lumbar support on the driver’s side are very comfortable. I am short so it is great that I can pump the seat up for better visibility. The navigation screen is at eye level. This is a first for us. It is great to not have to take your eyes off of the road. The extra USB ports are wonderful. The cabin is very quiet on the road, the only exception is when you have to accelerate to merge, but acceleration doesn’t take long. I love the automatic lift gate. It is so convenient when shopping."
"11 22, 2019",Totally amazing sporty SUV Toyota 2020 XSE Hybrid,I love it The new 2020 XSE hybrid is very stylish looking excellent fuel economy about 48 on the freeway it has a 8 inch touch screen it reminds me of my I pad built in lots of room in the cabin with 4 drive modes . One of the cool things about this car is if you ever valet your car or give it to a kid or family member to borrow you can set up the parameters of the speed they’re going the miles the distance you can actually watch where the car is from your phone. Plus you can Drop the car off valet parking and we all know how they like to hot Rod peoples cars and take him on joyrides I can now set how fast that car will go and how many miles are allowed to drive it it all comes with the advanced tech package With car . Plus I can start the car anywhere in the world through Wi-Fi or the Internet and I can lock and unlock the doors if I want. There is 0 rode noise on this car . Last thing there over 3 k in profit don’t pay more than 36k for this car . My Favorite color is the blue print flame catch up

"11  5, 2019",More Than I Expected,"Soon after purchase I have taken the TRD Off Road model over 100 miles of gravel, dirt and rocky roads and climbed over 15,000 of elevation on two different trips. Tight steering radius made hairpin switchbacks easy and those short steep inclines were not noticed with the stock Falken Wildpeak AT tires and the setting Normal ""Rock and Sand"". Great gas mileage driving all the time in the Sport Mode when not off road. Spacious and comfortable inside. Great car Toyota !!!"
"10 13, 2019",2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited Review,"Perennially a best-selling SUV, the RAV4 can be had in a wide range of iterations, so it’s no wonder it’s so popular. Price-Leader LE models are pretty basic, but an available hybrid Powertrain Control is compelling. High-end Limited models can challenge the Lexus NX with their many luxury features and a new TRD off-road model promises enhanced capacity as they hit the trails. Its robust styling makes it look right at home with the Toyota 4Runner SUV and Toyota Tacoma pickup truck. Driving dynamics tend toward the mundane side of the spectrum, but most consumers will find the 2020 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid’s ride comfortable and its handling comfortable. Adult passengers will also be pleased with Toyota’s generous legroom in both front and rear seats; Cargo Room is also competitive with the best in the segment.

2020 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID LIMITED REVIEW
Toyota introduces the TRD off-road model for 2020, which comes with unique 18-inch wheels, all-terrain tires, a TRD off-road suspension kit with red Coil springs, and lots of TRD logos ear tags interior and exterior. Elsewhere in the lineup, Android Auto capability becomes a standard feature as does SiriusXM satellite radio; The XLE models now come with a Power-adjustable driver’s seat, but lose the standard moonroof, which becomes part of the optional convenience package. The mid-range Adventure model gets a leather wrapped steering wheel and Shift knob, but the Power Lift Gate model is now optional.

"12 14, 2022",Everything is good except for power,I’ve owned this car for a year and put 20k miles on it (2021 Toyota RAV4) and everything on it is fairly decent except the engine and transmission I live on a mountain so there are lots of hills and curves and the transmission is DEFINITELY not geared for hilly terrain or maybe it’s the weak Mickey Mouse motor either way there appears to be a delay when you push the pedal down (it’s almost gotten me t-boned pulling out of a business onto the busy town road because it took so long to take off) so if your wanting something with remotely any power DO NOT get this car looking back now I would trade the decent gas mileage for a little more power and maybe it’s just my dodge Cummins I’m used to but this thing is weak sauce when it comes to the motor and power when you need it!
"11  1, 2022",Car was certified when we bought it.,We are not happy! We hit a small bump on any Pa road and it feels horrible!! No smooth ride. No power! No beeps for lane changing. Gas mileage is horrible! My daughter has a large suv and we followed them to Fl and back and it cost me more for gas! She has a Traverse. Never again.
"08 22, 2022",It’s Good & It’s Not So,I purchased a new 21 Limited with the Advanced Tech package And Limited Grade All Weather package.                             Its very very loud under acceleration. The highway  pavement noise and wind noise are barely tolerable. I have a bad back the seats are fantastic and I have a bad back they are great on long trips. Constantly Averaging 28mpg it’s dependable and I know it will hold its value.
"06  2, 2022",I love Rav4,"A little too big for myself but I love this car.
I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again."
"05 29, 2022",Best bang for the buck,I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.
"05 25, 2022",I love my Rav4,"Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.
Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also."
"04  7, 2022",RAV4 Limited,"Purchased the vehicle new and have had EXCELLENT gas milage, no problems at all, cargo space is almost as spacious as a Lexus RX350 and it is NON-turbocharged.    Performance and acceleration is extremely good for a 4 cylinder engine.
I would recommend it to anyone."
"06 12, 2021",Dude it’s a Toyota!,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I’ve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I’ll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
"06 10, 2021",Great ride,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
"06  9, 2021",We only buy Toyota always,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it’s fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
"06  8, 2021",Great Toyota SUV; Acceleration hesitation at 5 mo.,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
"06  8, 2021",Too soon to tell,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
"05 30, 2021",I love this vehicle.,I feel safe and very comfortable in my “Limited” rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can’t wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
"05 26, 2021",The best Mid size SUV you could buy!,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
"05 24, 2021",Best  car I’ve ever owned!,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
"05 22, 2021",3rd Rav4 we've had.,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
"05 13, 2021",not compliant,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
"05 12, 2021",The best car,"im in love with this car, i really recommend this car to a friend and family. 
the most beautiful car and is so comfortable car."
"05 11, 2021",Wonderful small suv,"this is my 2nd Rav 4 my 1st was a red one 2015. Loved that car too. 
Only complaint I have is the the lack of space in the front. And the red color had changed. Now I have a white Rav and it is classy and beautifully dramatic!"
"05 10, 2021",My second RAV4,"The 2021 RAV4 Premium is a great value.  Performance is adequate, with ease of driving and maintaining  being optimum.  Its a very comfortable SUV for gaining access and exit from the interior. The RAV4 is easy to drive, plus it's quite comfortable on longer trips.  Fuel mileage is quite good also, with the mid-30s in mpgs. This last generation has a very good rugged look, resembling a 4-Runner.  I highly recommend it."
"05  7, 2021",Love Love Love,I love my new RAV4 it is so user friendly the drive is amazing and I have all the safety features I got the Lunar Rock color and I love it
"05  3, 2021",Toyota’s are the best!,I’ve been driving them since 1970.  I Learned how to drive a stick shift on my 1970 Corolla.  Their cars are very reliable and I feel so safe driving in one.
"05  2, 2021",I’m getting used to the Eco Features,My CRV died. Had to get a new used car quick. All I could find was high mileage high price. So decided to go with a lease because I just can’t deal with bad service anymore. Earl Stewart has an excellent reputation for service. I miss all the cup holders and the extra storage layer of the CRV and the space to put my purse. Not sure I’ll keep the RAV4 after 3 years.
"04 29, 2021",Absolutely amazing value for the money!,"Car has so far met all of my needs, loving the Apple play feature! I think it’s perfect! Very spacious! I’m ready to blast through the snow with this beast!"
"04 27, 2021",Nice car,The Rav 4 LE is easy to drive/handles well and is great on gas.  Sufficient legroom in the back seat.  Nice looking exterior and interior.
"04 27, 2021",BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,GREAT SUV VERY ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE BIG SCREEN FOR GPS AND SOUND SYSTEM AMAZING HAS SYM MUSIC GREAT OVERALL AND A FAM CAR THATS THE BEST PART.
"04 26, 2021",First “Brand New” Car,"Purchased brand new on March 31. My first new car purchase - others in past purchased used.

Excellent vehicle and with incentives/financing, excellent value. This is my 2nd RAV4. Currently own a 2011 model as well. Love both!

Only complaint is the headrest. Feels like I am resting my head against a rock! Otherwise great!"
"04 25, 2021",Gorgeous Color!,"The car met and exceeded all my needs. The color, Lunar Rock is absolutely gorgeous. A few other features I love include keyless entry/ignition, audio, 2 toned color along with the geometric patterned seats, sunroof,  & 5 USB ports. The MPG is impressive & I am grateful for vehicle with AWD."
"04 23, 2021",Sexy - Fun to Drive,This car with the sport program allows me to drive on all surfaces.  The history of Toyota and the RAV4 line are know for quality and service.
"04 20, 2021",Love my new RAV4,"I really like my new RAV4.  I’ve only had it a day, but I think it is going to be just what I wanted.  The only thing that I didn’t realize at the time of purchase was that it didn’t have a function so I could open my garage door.  I really would have liked that."
"04 19, 2021",Very good mileage on gas,Rav 4 has plenty of room and power and great on gas mileage. The comfort level is great with no road noise. Has plenty of room in the rear for hauling luggage and boxes.
"04 19, 2021",very smooth,I love my car nice smooth ride very comfortable  lots of room inside   very nice looking  rich looking  love the color  I just love it
"04 19, 2021",It's okay.,It takes a lot of time to learn the complexities of this vehicle and I'm still learning this vehicle after 2 months. The owners manual has been helpful even it sends to different pages to finally get to the information you need.
"04 19, 2021",Great car. My third RAV4.,"Love the size of the car, the way it rides and it’s reliability. Sorry they dropped the CD player as I am an older buyer used that all the time in my last vehicle."
"04 18, 2021",4th RAV4 in a row.,"Comfort, stylish, roomy, and a smooth ride. I’ve been driving RAV4’s since 2005 and have always been completely satisfied. The technology is amazing too. I would certainly recommend this car."
"04 15, 2021",Most reliable car I own,"Spacious, good gas mileage, drive is smooth. Has wi fi. Comfortable, big, lots of technology features. Good car size and awd. Great safety features such"
"04 15, 2021",Don't like the engine stop and start system.,Overall I do like the toyota rav 4. However I'm not a fan of the on off engine gas saving system. It causes vibration at take off pedal shudder just a rough start after engine start is engaged. Also when putting it in park in the engine on off mode it goes into park real rough. When the system is disabled it doesn't have any of the issues I have mentioned its like a different car. Toyota has some engineering issues with the system that they need to work on. The owners manual says that all the things I mentioned are normal but I don't like it. Had the 2018 rav4 it didn't have that system it drove great and got decent gas mileage
"04 13, 2021",We are content so far. Pretty good purchase,"We went to look at the Hybrid version of Rav4's but we were told that they wouldn't know how soon they'd get them back in stock, so we decided to buy a gasoline version of XLE Premium with all the options and accessories we wanted, the price after tax and fee ended up being over $40K.  We didn't know we could've bought a Limited trim model for such price until we came home with the new Rav4. Oh, well, with all the options and accessories we added, with the Limited, it probably would've gone over $43k, so I guess it was a good purchase.  This Rav4 is a replacement for our aging 2007 BMW 530xi Wagon with now over 210k miles on it.  Compared to the BMW which was $62,7k when we bought it new, the Rav4 has almost everything our BMW has, plus more technology.  Rav4 rides pretty good, it has a solid feel, not very cushy but it's not stiff, either. Only downside compared to the BMW is the sound insulation. Rav4 is a bit louder on freeway than the BMW.  Now the Rav4 has about 550 miles on the odometer, Gas mileage so far has been GREAT at around 32mpg combined as we drive it on freeway a lot more than in the city. The engine sounds quite entertaining(funny), that's probably because we aren't used to hear a 4 cylinder engine sound for 14+ years.  Cargo capacity is great, LED headlights and LED fog lamps are very bright.  We are still learning how new safety technologies work and how to use some stuff. For only a bit over $40k, it has everything we needed in a car, it's a pretty good purchase. We are very happy that we could save quite a bit ($20k to $30k) by switching to Toyota from BMW."
"04 12, 2021","Great SUV, space for my grandkids","This SUV is what I was looking for. It has room for my grandkids. It drives 
really nice. It has a lot of features. I love my sunroof."
"04 11, 2021",Excelente,Es lo máximo todo muy confortable excelente a/c las luces me encanta todo en sentido general muy cómodo los asientos las luces led me encantan
"04  9, 2021","Brand new model for us, so far it's great","We have driven only Toyota's for last 30yrs & all have been  economical, durable and fun to drive. I drove (& still am) driving my 2000 Camry. It was bought 2nd hand 20 yrs ago & has been coast to coast. I'm sure this Rav will too."
"03 31, 2021",BEST RELIABLE CAR EVER,"This car has all of my needs, the special features are unbelievable  & the drive is so smooth. This cat is sexy & comfortable to drive. The gas mileage is out of this world & the trunk has a lot of extra space."
"03 29, 2021",Very nice car,"I love our RAV4. We decided against the hybrid, but they seemed nice too. About the only negative thing I could say about it is that the engine is a bit loud at higher RPM’s, but nothing too crazy. It’s very comfortable and gets good mileage. I anticipate keeping this vehicle for a good 200,000 miles or more."
"03 29, 2021",My forever vehicle,Looking for a smaller vehicle but a suv. Toyota’s r dependable. My husband wanted me to get a Toyota as they will last for a long time.
"03 29, 2021",GOOD CHOICE,"THIS SUV FOLLOWED 8 YEARS DRIVING A QUALITY SEDAN. I LIKED THE HIGHER BODY, INCLUDING SEATING,  THE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE RIDE, ITS RESPOSIVENESS AS A VEHICLE. HAVEN'T DRIVEN IT LONG ENOUGH TO  JUDGE IT FURTHER YET."
"03 28, 2021",First Car I’ve Ever Owned,After doing extensive research and loving the sporty look I knew the RAV4 XLE was one of my top options going into the dealership. Drives great and highly recommend to anyone considering it!
"03 28, 2021",Muy complacido.,"Excelente SUV, cumple con mis expectativas. confort, buen manejo, buen  rendimiento por millas  excelente tecnología, estabilidad, elegante figura, buen power, seguridad. Por  lo que puedo afirmar y recomendar como  un  excelente SUV."

"03 21, 2021",Just bought it. Love it so far!,I love the look inside and outside of the vehicle. Runs great so far. Look forward to  driving it this summer! Love the new sunroof!
"03 21, 2021",Love this car,This car has everything I need.  I am more concerned about safety features than style but my Rav4 XLE has it all.  I am so happy with it.
"03 17, 2021",2021 RAV4 awd,"I had a 2007 Toyota Camry. Had it from new to 2021. No problem. Just regular brake, tires, oil change, etc. I want a suv now. I like reading and look at cars on internet. I look at a hundred reviews of all cars that are in same class and size as the RAV4 . It all came back to Toyota and rav4.  Some reviews were ok and some were great. But with last Toyota Camry experience. I am sticking to what is good and works. And I picked the RAV4.  I did not pick the Toyota Camry. Because it is two inchs lower to ground than my last Camry. Even   though the Camry has awd option."
"03 13, 2021",LOVE the RAV4!,"This is my 2nd RAV4. I love the size, reliability, and look.  Drives great is winter weather.  Our Great Dane mix fits perfectly inside too!   :)"

"03 11, 2021",Car I own,"This vehicle is more than I thought. The suv is very spacious, has the bells and whistles of a luxury vehicle for the price the comman person could afford. I don’t know why I waited so long. As Leman Toyota is a dealership that will meet all of your needs and wants. You don’t get this experience at the big city dealers."
"03 10, 2021",Best car I have bought,The comfort is great for a smaller car I am a big guy .alot of leg room smooth ride by far the best car I have purchased.
"03 10, 2021",Happy with purchase,I am so far happy with my new car. I am excited about the newer technology and the way it drives. Very pleased to drive a new vehicle.
"03  5, 2021",NEW RAV4 2021  XLE,"So far so good! Still learning the Navigation system- Only had it 4 days!! :)

"03  1, 2021",Coolest Car I've Owned.,"This vehicle's exterior and interior design are stunning. I love the sky silver metallic look of the Rav4. Adjusting the seat on the driver is easy and fun. The car is SUV and higher than a sedan, which works out perfectly for me. I was concerned at first that it would be too small, but you can fold the back seat to make rooms for storage."
"03  1, 2021","Bello mi carro, I love this","Me encanta mi nuevo Carro,  nada como el olor a new car , el color super espectacular, gracias a los trabajadores en especial a la señora Mary Correa por ayudarme en todo el proceso."
"02 25, 2021",Not as many features as my Chevy Silverado,It drives very well in the snow and is roomy. It doesn't have the pick up I'm used to that was in my Chevy Silverado.
"02 25, 2021",It is a fun easy car to drive,This is our 5th RAV4. We like them. They work for us & have grandkids car seats buckled in the back seat. Easy to drive!
"02 24, 2021",Great purchase!,"I love the style of the vehicle, color, has all the bells and whistles I need, along with great gas mileage.    I purchased the Rav4 Adventure and love the look inside and out."
"02 21, 2021",LE feels stripped for such an expensive vehicle,"Seat belt alarm is ridiculous. Toyota must think we're all children. Have to go back to dealer to disable it. Interior should be better. Everything feels cheap and not well designed. TIre valves not long enough. Under hood latch is cheap. Interior lights not bright enough. Horn needs to be louder. Should be able to dim Infotainment screen. I was expecting more for a $30,000 vehicle. Thin hard plastic steering wheel should have told me all I needed to know. It better be a trouble free vehicle. After 26+ years, it should be better!"
"02 19, 2021",DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH,This was by far the best car purchase I have ever made! Very satisfied!! Feels like driving on clouds. Do not have to tank up so frequently.
"02 17, 2021",Love my vehicle,"Love how this car meets all of my needs. Very spacious and love all of the bells and whistles. I especially love the heated steering wheel, especially in the wintertime."
"02  7, 2021",This is a good car for us I always use Toyota cars,This car meets all my needs it is why I asked for to Yury Vazquez and it’s what I get from him. I’m very happy with the experience and the only thing is the interior 💺 that after all yesterday I tell my husband that I forget about the vynel seats because it’s more protection for the seats.But anyway I’m very happy with my car 🚗.
"02  7, 2021",Good car for me and my family.,"I like it.My kids like it.We are happy with the car,good to go. I like outside and inside the only thing was that I like the vinyl seats but for now one is ok ✅ we can handle it."
"02  7, 2021",Great Vehicle,"This is the 2nd RAV4 I've owned.  I really like the improvements they've made from the 2016 to the 2021 models.  It's fun to drive, handles well under all road conditions and gets great gas mileage."
"02  6, 2021",Most comfortable car  I ever owed,"Feel very safe. Beautiful interior and exterior, useful  equipment. Low gas usage. 
I will definitely recommend my family and friends RAV4 2021.  Most comfortable car I ever had a chance to drive."
"02  1, 2021",I love it,It’s got tons of room. The design is beautiful. I love the color Luna rock. It’s a great family car. I love that the seat can boot up.
"01 28, 2021",Great car,Very nice car. Good value. Nice options. Great color.  Comfortable. Good runnner. Just what I had hoped for in a new car.  Affordable luxury transportation.
"01 23, 2021",The car  met all my needs.,"Love the gas mileage  on it. And the car is very comforter ,space,and elegant.  Love that it connect  my phone using the bluetooth  not a Aux cord."
"01 23, 2021",This is my First Rav 4,Needs more horse power.  The ride is a little more bumpy going over holes in the road than expected.  Passenger seat does not go back far enough for tall people
"01 11, 2021",I love my new car,This car was what I wanted. It has all the positive aspects  of a safe and reliable  vehicle. Well designed and very comfortable.  I am very happy.
"01 11, 2021",Living my new Toyota,This Suv met my needs with a nice body style. Also has upgraded technology from a lot of usb ports and new computer monitor with apple play. It has a smooth drive and leg room for the family
"01  8, 2021",even better than my 2018!,This 2021 was very similar to my 2018 but a few extra standard features like power driver seat. unfortunately does not have front and rear bumper alerts
"01  4, 2021",This is our 3rd Toyota and the only kind we’ll own,"This is my forever vehicle, I love how it rides, plenty of room especially the back seat, it fits 2 car seats and still room for a person to sit. Drives and handles great, a big bonus was the weather tech floor mats!"
"01  4, 2021",Nice to get a new Rav4,"It meets our need for a new car at an affordable price. Some newer technology but not overload.  Does not have CD player or power seats and doors which I will miss. Seats are comfortable seem small but I am going from a Chrysler van to A Rav 4. We traded in a 2007 Rav 4 so we are use to the size and we also still have our van so it not a big change..  
Great gas mileage so far ,nice ride and handles well also.  Love that it has AWD , phone capabilities plus more.  Beautiful car easy to learn new technology."
"01  2, 2021",Comfortable and convenient,"The newer designs really load up on features, and keep you up on technology. The RAV4 comes in various packages depending on your needs. And you can easily get features added for the most part. The only minor issue is that the charging and data ports are still all USB-A and 2.5A. Wish they had the newer USB-C and fast-charge ports. I did get the wireless charging pad though."

"11 30, 2020",The car is nice.,It is good.  A little sluggish.  Transmission could be smoother.  Covers everything I was looking for.  The door arm rest could use more padding.  Cenre re console is a little tight on the right leg.
"11 29, 2020",Great gas mileage,"The RAV4 is great on gas mileage. I am use to driving something bigger, so it is an adjustment for me. It is roomy & the technology is taking some getting used to. Overall, it is a great vehicle."
"11 28, 2020",Most reliable car,"This car is excellent,  the best of the best,  I am very happy,  I will recommend this car to everyone, I feel I am driving an airplane."

automatic lift/closure of back door, just everything! It is large enough to haul things and yet small enough t maneuver and park."
"10 21, 2020",This is my fourth Rav 4 (7th Toyota) in a row,"The car fits my needs in terms of comfort and performance.  My dogs fit comfortably, I never worry about mechanical issues, it is beautiful, a joy to drive, and I love all the “bells and whistles”!  7 Toyota cars in a row with NEVER an issue or complaint.  I am proud to be a Toyota owner.
The color lunar rock is spectacular.  The sound system amazing and heated steering wheel a blessing!"
"10 20, 2020",I LOVE my new vehicle!,"I love my Rav4! It has so many features and drives so well. It's a dream on the highway and in city driving. And, the sound system is perfect as I love music!"
"10  6, 2020",Very reliable car.,This car is just perfect for driving to and from work. It is very comfortable. I love the all the new  upgrade that was done for the 2021 make. I love the color of the vehicle too.
"12 14, 2022",Everything is good except for power,I’ve owned this car for a year and put 20k miles on it (2021 Toyota RAV4) and everything on it is fairly decent except the engine and transmission I live on a mountain so there are lots of hills and curves and the transmission is DEFINITELY not geared for hilly terrain or maybe it’s the weak Mickey Mouse motor either way there appears to be a delay when you push the pedal down (it’s almost gotten me t-boned pulling out of a business onto the busy town road because it took so long to take off) so if your wanting something with remotely any power DO NOT get this car looking back now I would trade the decent gas mileage for a little more power and maybe it’s just my dodge Cummins I’m used to but this thing is weak sauce when it comes to the motor and power when you need it!
"11  1, 2022",Car was certified when we bought it.,We are not happy! We hit a small bump on any Pa road and it feels horrible!! No smooth ride. No power! No beeps for lane changing. Gas mileage is horrible! My daughter has a large suv and we followed them to Fl and back and it cost me more for gas! She has a Traverse. Never again.
"08 22, 2022",It’s Good & It’s Not So,I purchased a new 21 Limited with the Advanced Tech package And Limited Grade All Weather package.                             Its very very loud under acceleration. The highway  pavement noise and wind noise are barely tolerable. I have a bad back the seats are fantastic and I have a bad back they are great on long trips. Constantly Averaging 28mpg it’s dependable and I know it will hold its value.
"06  2, 2022",I love Rav4,"A little too big for myself but I love this car.
I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again."
"05 29, 2022",Best bang for the buck,I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.
"05 25, 2022",I love my Rav4,"Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.
Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also."
"04  7, 2022",RAV4 Limited,"Purchased the vehicle new and have had EXCELLENT gas milage, no problems at all, cargo space is almost as spacious as a Lexus RX350 and it is NON-turbocharged.    Performance and acceleration is extremely good for a 4 cylinder engine.
I would recommend it to anyone."
"06 12, 2021",Dude it’s a Toyota!,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I’ve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I’ll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
"06 10, 2021",Great ride,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
"06  9, 2021",We only buy Toyota always,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it’s fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
"06  8, 2021",Great Toyota SUV; Acceleration hesitation at 5 mo.,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
"06  8, 2021",Too soon to tell,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
"05 30, 2021",I love this vehicle.,I feel safe and very comfortable in my “Limited” rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can’t wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
"05 26, 2021",The best Mid size SUV you could buy!,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
"05 24, 2021",Best  car I’ve ever owned!,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
"05 22, 2021",3rd Rav4 we've had.,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
"05 13, 2021",not compliant,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
"05 12, 2021",The best car,"im in love with this car, i really recommend this car to a friend and family. 
the most beautiful car and is so comfortable car."
"05 11, 2021",Wonderful small suv,"this is my 2nd Rav 4 my 1st was a red one 2015. Loved that car too. 
Only complaint I have is the the lack of space in the front. And the red color had changed. Now I have a white Rav and it is classy and beautifully dramatic!"
"05 10, 2021",My second RAV4,"The 2021 RAV4 Premium is a great value.  Performance is adequate, with ease of driving and maintaining  being optimum.  Its a very comfortable SUV for gaining access and exit from the interior. The RAV4 is easy to drive, plus it's quite comfortable on longer trips.  Fuel mileage is quite good also, with the mid-30s in mpgs. This last generation has a very good rugged look, resembling a 4-Runner.  I highly recommend it."
"05  7, 2021",Love Love Love,I love my new RAV4 it is so user friendly the drive is amazing and I have all the safety features I got the Lunar Rock color and I love it
"05  3, 2021",Toyota’s are the best!,I’ve been driving them since 1970.  I Learned how to drive a stick shift on my 1970 Corolla.  Their cars are very reliable and I feel so safe driving in one.
"05  2, 2021",I’m getting used to the Eco Features,My CRV died. Had to get a new used car quick. All I could find was high mileage high price. So decided to go with a lease because I just can’t deal with bad service anymore. Earl Stewart has an excellent reputation for service. I miss all the cup holders and the extra storage layer of the CRV and the space to put my purse. Not sure I’ll keep the RAV4 after 3 years.
"04 29, 2021",Absolutely amazing value for the money!,"Car has so far met all of my needs, loving the Apple play feature! I think it’s perfect! Very spacious! I’m ready to blast through the snow with this beast!"
"04 27, 2021",Nice car,The Rav 4 LE is easy to drive/handles well and is great on gas.  Sufficient legroom in the back seat.  Nice looking exterior and interior.
"04 27, 2021",BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,GREAT SUV VERY ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE BIG SCREEN FOR GPS AND SOUND SYSTEM AMAZING HAS SYM MUSIC GREAT OVERALL AND A FAM CAR THATS THE BEST PART.
"04 26, 2021",First “Brand New” Car,"Purchased brand new on March 31. My first new car purchase - others in past purchased used.

Excellent vehicle and with incentives/financing, excellent value. This is my 2nd RAV4. Currently own a 2011 model as well. Love both!

Only complaint is the headrest. Feels like I am resting my head against a rock! Otherwise great!"
"04 25, 2021",Gorgeous Color!,"The car met and exceeded all my needs. The color, Lunar Rock is absolutely gorgeous. A few other features I love include keyless entry/ignition, audio, 2 toned color along with the geometric patterned seats, sunroof,  & 5 USB ports. The MPG is impressive & I am grateful for vehicle with AWD."
"04 23, 2021",Sexy - Fun to Drive,This car with the sport program allows me to drive on all surfaces.  The history of Toyota and the RAV4 line are know for quality and service.
"04 20, 2021",Love my new RAV4,"I really like my new RAV4.  I’ve only had it a day, but I think it is going to be just what I wanted.  The only thing that I didn’t realize at the time of purchase was that it didn’t have a function so I could open my garage door.  I really would have liked that."
"04 19, 2021",Very good mileage on gas,Rav 4 has plenty of room and power and great on gas mileage. The comfort level is great with no road noise. Has plenty of room in the rear for hauling luggage and boxes.
"04 19, 2021",very smooth,I love my car nice smooth ride very comfortable  lots of room inside   very nice looking  rich looking  love the color  I just love it
"04 19, 2021",It's okay.,It takes a lot of time to learn the complexities of this vehicle and I'm still learning this vehicle after 2 months. The owners manual has been helpful even it sends to different pages to finally get to the information you need.
"04 19, 2021",Great car. My third RAV4.,"Love the size of the car, the way it rides and it’s reliability. Sorry they dropped the CD player as I am an older buyer used that all the time in my last vehicle."
"04 18, 2021",4th RAV4 in a row.,"Comfort, stylish, roomy, and a smooth ride. I’ve been driving RAV4’s since 2005 and have always been completely satisfied. The technology is amazing too. I would certainly recommend this car."
"04 15, 2021",Most reliable car I own,"Spacious, good gas mileage, drive is smooth. Has wi fi. Comfortable, big, lots of technology features. Good car size and awd. Great safety features such"
"04 15, 2021",Don't like the engine stop and start system.,Overall I do like the toyota rav 4. However I'm not a fan of the on off engine gas saving system. It causes vibration at take off pedal shudder just a rough start after engine start is engaged. Also when putting it in park in the engine on off mode it goes into park real rough. When the system is disabled it doesn't have any of the issues I have mentioned its like a different car. Toyota has some engineering issues with the system that they need to work on. The owners manual says that all the things I mentioned are normal but I don't like it. Had the 2018 rav4 it didn't have that system it drove great and got decent gas mileage
"04 13, 2021",We are content so far. Pretty good purchase,"We went to look at the Hybrid version of Rav4's but we were told that they wouldn't know how soon they'd get them back in stock, so we decided to buy a gasoline version of XLE Premium with all the options and accessories we wanted, the price after tax and fee ended up being over $40K.  We didn't know we could've bought a Limited trim model for such price until we came home with the new Rav4. Oh, well, with all the options and accessories we added, with the Limited, it probably would've gone over $43k, so I guess it was a good purchase.  This Rav4 is a replacement for our aging 2007 BMW 530xi Wagon with now over 210k miles on it.  Compared to the BMW which was $62,7k when we bought it new, the Rav4 has almost everything our BMW has, plus more technology.  Rav4 rides pretty good, it has a solid feel, not very cushy but it's not stiff, either. Only downside compared to the BMW is the sound insulation. Rav4 is a bit louder on freeway than the BMW.  Now the Rav4 has about 550 miles on the odometer, Gas mileage so far has been GREAT at around 32mpg combined as we drive it on freeway a lot more than in the city. The engine sounds quite entertaining(funny), that's probably because we aren't used to hear a 4 cylinder engine sound for 14+ years.  Cargo capacity is great, LED headlights and LED fog lamps are very bright.  We are still learning how new safety technologies work and how to use some stuff. For only a bit over $40k, it has everything we needed in a car, it's a pretty good purchase. We are very happy that we could save quite a bit ($20k to $30k) by switching to Toyota from BMW."
"04 12, 2021","Great SUV, space for my grandkids","This SUV is what I was looking for. It has room for my grandkids. It drives 
really nice. It has a lot of features. I love my sunroof."
"04 11, 2021",Excelente,Es lo máximo todo muy confortable excelente a/c las luces me encanta todo en sentido general muy cómodo los asientos las luces led me encantan
"04  9, 2021","Brand new model for us, so far it's great","We have driven only Toyota's for last 30yrs & all have been  economical, durable and fun to drive. I drove (& still am) driving my 2000 Camry. It was bought 2nd hand 20 yrs ago & has been coast to coast. I'm sure this Rav will too."
"03 31, 2021",BEST RELIABLE CAR EVER,"This car has all of my needs, the special features are unbelievable  & the drive is so smooth. This cat is sexy & comfortable to drive. The gas mileage is out of this world & the trunk has a lot of extra space."
"03 29, 2021",Very nice car,"I love our RAV4. We decided against the hybrid, but they seemed nice too. About the only negative thing I could say about it is that the engine is a bit loud at higher RPM’s, but nothing too crazy. It’s very comfortable and gets good mileage. I anticipate keeping this vehicle for a good 200,000 miles or more."
"03 29, 2021",My forever vehicle,Looking for a smaller vehicle but a suv. Toyota’s r dependable. My husband wanted me to get a Toyota as they will last for a long time.
"03 29, 2021",GOOD CHOICE,"THIS SUV FOLLOWED 8 YEARS DRIVING A QUALITY SEDAN. I LIKED THE HIGHER BODY, INCLUDING SEATING,  THE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE RIDE, ITS RESPOSIVENESS AS A VEHICLE. HAVEN'T DRIVEN IT LONG ENOUGH TO  JUDGE IT FURTHER YET."
"03 28, 2021",First Car I’ve Ever Owned,After doing extensive research and loving the sporty look I knew the RAV4 XLE was one of my top options going into the dealership. Drives great and highly recommend to anyone considering it!
"03 28, 2021",Muy complacido.,"Excelente SUV, cumple con mis expectativas. confort, buen manejo, buen  rendimiento por millas  excelente tecnología, estabilidad, elegante figura, buen power, seguridad. Por  lo que puedo afirmar y recomendar como  un  excelente SUV."

"03 21, 2021",Just bought it. Love it so far!,I love the look inside and outside of the vehicle. Runs great so far. Look forward to  driving it this summer! Love the new sunroof!
"03 21, 2021",Love this car,This car has everything I need.  I am more concerned about safety features than style but my Rav4 XLE has it all.  I am so happy with it.
"03 17, 2021",2021 RAV4 awd,"I had a 2007 Toyota Camry. Had it from new to 2021. No problem. Just regular brake, tires, oil change, etc. I want a suv now. I like reading and look at cars on internet. I look at a hundred reviews of all cars that are in same class and size as the RAV4 . It all came back to Toyota and rav4.  Some reviews were ok and some were great. But with last Toyota Camry experience. I am sticking to what is good and works. And I picked the RAV4.  I did not pick the Toyota Camry. Because it is two inchs lower to ground than my last Camry. Even   though the Camry has awd option."
"03 13, 2021",LOVE the RAV4!,"This is my 2nd RAV4. I love the size, reliability, and look.  Drives great is winter weather.  Our Great Dane mix fits perfectly inside too!   :)"
"03 12, 2021",I love RAV4 because it is always reliable,"It meets all my needs.comfortable,spacious,all wheel drive and best mid size SUV. Fun to drive.good on mileage and good for long drives.Very nice exterior.So lucky to have this car."
"03 11, 2021",Car I own,"This vehicle is more than I thought. The suv is very spacious, has the bells and whistles of a luxury vehicle for the price the comman person could afford. I don’t know why I waited so long. As Leman Toyota is a dealership that will meet all of your needs and wants. You don’t get this experience at the big city dealers."
"03 10, 2021",Best car I have bought,The comfort is great for a smaller car I am a big guy .alot of leg room smooth ride by far the best car I have purchased.
"03 10, 2021",Happy with purchase,I am so far happy with my new car. I am excited about the newer technology and the way it drives. Very pleased to drive a new vehicle.
"03  5, 2021",NEW RAV4 2021  XLE,"So far so good! Still learning the Navigation system- Only had it 4 days!! :)

"03  2, 2021",Great car,Chuck the sales guy was great ... great experience great great great. Would see chuck again fir sure . No doubt it was a great purchase

"03  1, 2021",Coolest Car I've Owned.,"This vehicle's exterior and interior design are stunning. I love the sky silver metallic look of the Rav4. Adjusting the seat on the driver is easy and fun. The car is SUV and higher than a sedan, which works out perfectly for me. I was concerned at first that it would be too small, but you can fold the back seat to make rooms for storage."
"03  1, 2021","Bello mi carro, I love this","Me encanta mi nuevo Carro,  nada como el olor a new car , el color super espectacular, gracias a los trabajadores en especial a la señora Mary Correa por ayudarme en todo el proceso."
"02 25, 2021",Not as many features as my Chevy Silverado,It drives very well in the snow and is roomy. It doesn't have the pick up I'm used to that was in my Chevy Silverado.
"02 25, 2021",It is a fun easy car to drive,This is our 5th RAV4. We like them. They work for us & have grandkids car seats buckled in the back seat. Easy to drive!
"02 24, 2021",Great purchase!,"I love the style of the vehicle, color, has all the bells and whistles I need, along with great gas mileage.    I purchased the Rav4 Adventure and love the look inside and out."
"02 21, 2021",LE feels stripped for such an expensive vehicle,"Seat belt alarm is ridiculous. Toyota must think we're all children. Have to go back to dealer to disable it. Interior should be better. Everything feels cheap and not well designed. TIre valves not long enough. Under hood latch is cheap. Interior lights not bright enough. Horn needs to be louder. Should be able to dim Infotainment screen. I was expecting more for a $30,000 vehicle. Thin hard plastic steering wheel should have told me all I needed to know. It better be a trouble free vehicle. After 26+ years, it should be better!"
"02 19, 2021",DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH,This was by far the best car purchase I have ever made! Very satisfied!! Feels like driving on clouds. Do not have to tank up so frequently.
"02 17, 2021",Love my vehicle,"Love how this car meets all of my needs. Very spacious and love all of the bells and whistles. I especially love the heated steering wheel, especially in the wintertime."
"02  7, 2021",This is a good car for us I always use Toyota cars,This car meets all my needs it is why I asked for to Yury Vazquez and it’s what I get from him. I’m very happy with the experience and the only thing is the interior 💺 that after all yesterday I tell my husband that I forget about the vynel seats because it’s more protection for the seats.But anyway I’m very happy with my car 🚗.
"02  7, 2021",Good car for me and my family.,"I like it.My kids like it.We are happy with the car,good to go. I like outside and inside the only thing was that I like the vinyl seats but for now one is ok ✅ we can handle it."
"02  7, 2021",Great Vehicle,"This is the 2nd RAV4 I've owned.  I really like the improvements they've made from the 2016 to the 2021 models.  It's fun to drive, handles well under all road conditions and gets great gas mileage."
"02  6, 2021",Most comfortable car  I ever owed,"Feel very safe. Beautiful interior and exterior, useful  equipment. Low gas usage. 
I will definitely recommend my family and friends RAV4 2021.  Most comfortable car I ever had a chance to drive."

"01 23, 2021",This is my First Rav 4,Needs more horse power.  The ride is a little more bumpy going over holes in the road than expected.  Passenger seat does not go back far enough for tall people
"01 11, 2021",I love my new car,This car was what I wanted. It has all the positive aspects  of a safe and reliable  vehicle. Well designed and very comfortable.  I am very happy.
"01 11, 2021",Living my new Toyota,This Suv met my needs with a nice body style. Also has upgraded technology from a lot of usb ports and new computer monitor with apple play. It has a smooth drive and leg room for the family
"01  8, 2021",even better than my 2018!,This 2021 was very similar to my 2018 but a few extra standard features like power driver seat. unfortunately does not have front and rear bumper alerts
"01  4, 2021",This is our 3rd Toyota and the only kind we’ll own,"This is my forever vehicle, I love how it rides, plenty of room especially the back seat, it fits 2 car seats and still room for a person to sit. Drives and handles great, a big bonus was the weather tech floor mats!"
"01  4, 2021",Nice to get a new Rav4,"It meets our need for a new car at an affordable price. Some newer technology but not overload.  Does not have CD player or power seats and doors which I will miss. Seats are comfortable seem small but I am going from a Chrysler van to A Rav 4. We traded in a 2007 Rav 4 so we are use to the size and we also still have our van so it not a big change..  
Great gas mileage so far ,nice ride and handles well also.  Love that it has AWD , phone capabilities plus more.  Beautiful car easy to learn new technology."
"01  2, 2021",Comfortable and convenient,"The newer designs really load up on features, and keep you up on technology. The RAV4 comes in various packages depending on your needs. And you can easily get features added for the most part. The only minor issue is that the charging and data ports are still all USB-A and 2.5A. Wish they had the newer USB-C and fast-charge ports. I did get the wireless charging pad though."

"11 30, 2020",The car is nice.,It is good.  A little sluggish.  Transmission could be smoother.  Covers everything I was looking for.  The door arm rest could use more padding.  Cenre re console is a little tight on the right leg.
"11 29, 2020",Great gas mileage,"The RAV4 is great on gas mileage. I am use to driving something bigger, so it is an adjustment for me. It is roomy & the technology is taking some getting used to. Overall, it is a great vehicle."

"10 29, 2020",This car has everything!,"This car has so many features. Love the heated seats and steering wheel,
automatic lift/closure of back door, just everything! It is large enough to haul things and yet small enough t maneuver and park."
"10 21, 2020",This is my fourth Rav 4 (7th Toyota) in a row,"The car fits my needs in terms of comfort and performance.  My dogs fit comfortably, I never worry about mechanical issues, it is beautiful, a joy to drive, and I love all the “bells and whistles”!  7 Toyota cars in a row with NEVER an issue or complaint.  I am proud to be a Toyota owner.
The color lunar rock is spectacular.  The sound system amazing and heated steering wheel a blessing!"
"10 20, 2020",I LOVE my new vehicle!,"I love my Rav4! It has so many features and drives so well. It's a dream on the highway and in city driving. And, the sound system is perfect as I love music!"
"10  6, 2020",Very reliable car.,This car is just perfect for driving to and from work. It is very comfortable. I love the all the new  upgrade that was done for the 2021 make. I love the color of the vehicle too.
"12 14, 2022",Everything is good except for power,I’ve owned this car for a year and put 20k miles on it (2021 Toyota RAV4) and everything on it is fairly decent except the engine and transmission I live on a mountain so there are lots of hills and curves and the transmission is DEFINITELY not geared for hilly terrain or maybe it’s the weak Mickey Mouse motor either way there appears to be a delay when you push the pedal down (it’s almost gotten me t-boned pulling out of a business onto the busy town road because it took so long to take off) so if your wanting something with remotely any power DO NOT get this car looking back now I would trade the decent gas mileage for a little more power and maybe it’s just my dodge Cummins I’m used to but this thing is weak sauce when it comes to the motor and power when you need it!
"11  1, 2022",Car was certified when we bought it.,We are not happy! We hit a small bump on any Pa road and it feels horrible!! No smooth ride. No power! No beeps for lane changing. Gas mileage is horrible! My daughter has a large suv and we followed them to Fl and back and it cost me more for gas! She has a Traverse. Never again.
"08 22, 2022",It’s Good & It’s Not So,I purchased a new 21 Limited with the Advanced Tech package And Limited Grade All Weather package.                             Its very very loud under acceleration. The highway  pavement noise and wind noise are barely tolerable. I have a bad back the seats are fantastic and I have a bad back they are great on long trips. Constantly Averaging 28mpg it’s dependable and I know it will hold its value.
"06  2, 2022",I love Rav4,"A little too big for myself but I love this car.
I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again."
"05 29, 2022",Best bang for the buck,I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.
"05 25, 2022",I love my Rav4,"Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.
Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also."
"04  7, 2022",RAV4 Limited,"Purchased the vehicle new and have had EXCELLENT gas milage, no problems at all, cargo space is almost as spacious as a Lexus RX350 and it is NON-turbocharged.    Performance and acceleration is extremely good for a 4 cylinder engine.
I would recommend it to anyone."
"06 12, 2021",Dude it’s a Toyota!,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I’ve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I’ll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
"06 10, 2021",Great ride,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
"06  9, 2021",We only buy Toyota always,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it’s fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
"06  8, 2021",Great Toyota SUV; Acceleration hesitation at 5 mo.,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
"06  8, 2021",Too soon to tell,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
"05 30, 2021",I love this vehicle.,I feel safe and very comfortable in my “Limited” rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can’t wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
"05 26, 2021",The best Mid size SUV you could buy!,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
"05 24, 2021",Best  car I’ve ever owned!,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
"05 22, 2021",3rd Rav4 we've had.,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
"05 13, 2021",not compliant,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
"05 12, 2021",The best car,"im in love with this car, i really recommend this car to a friend and family. 
the most beautiful car and is so comfortable car."
"05 11, 2021",Wonderful small suv,"this is my 2nd Rav 4 my 1st was a red one 2015. Loved that car too. 
Only complaint I have is the the lack of space in the front. And the red color had changed. Now I have a white Rav and it is classy and beautifully dramatic!"
"05 10, 2021",My second RAV4,"The 2021 RAV4 Premium is a great value.  Performance is adequate, with ease of driving and maintaining  being optimum.  Its a very comfortable SUV for gaining access and exit from the interior. The RAV4 is easy to drive, plus it's quite comfortable on longer trips.  Fuel mileage is quite good also, with the mid-30s in mpgs. This last generation has a very good rugged look, resembling a 4-Runner.  I highly recommend it."
"05  7, 2021",Love Love Love,I love my new RAV4 it is so user friendly the drive is amazing and I have all the safety features I got the Lunar Rock color and I love it
"05  3, 2021",Toyota’s are the best!,I’ve been driving them since 1970.  I Learned how to drive a stick shift on my 1970 Corolla.  Their cars are very reliable and I feel so safe driving in one.
"05  2, 2021",I’m getting used to the Eco Features,My CRV died. Had to get a new used car quick. All I could find was high mileage high price. So decided to go with a lease because I just can’t deal with bad service anymore. Earl Stewart has an excellent reputation for service. I miss all the cup holders and the extra storage layer of the CRV and the space to put my purse. Not sure I’ll keep the RAV4 after 3 years.
"04 29, 2021",Absolutely amazing value for the money!,"Car has so far met all of my needs, loving the Apple play feature! I think it’s perfect! Very spacious! I’m ready to blast through the snow with this beast!"
"04 27, 2021",Nice car,The Rav 4 LE is easy to drive/handles well and is great on gas.  Sufficient legroom in the back seat.  Nice looking exterior and interior.
"04 27, 2021",BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,GREAT SUV VERY ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE BIG SCREEN FOR GPS AND SOUND SYSTEM AMAZING HAS SYM MUSIC GREAT OVERALL AND A FAM CAR THATS THE BEST PART.
"04 26, 2021",First “Brand New” Car,"Purchased brand new on March 31. My first new car purchase - others in past purchased used.

Excellent vehicle and with incentives/financing, excellent value. This is my 2nd RAV4. Currently own a 2011 model as well. Love both!

Only complaint is the headrest. Feels like I am resting my head against a rock! Otherwise great!"
"04 25, 2021",Gorgeous Color!,"The car met and exceeded all my needs. The color, Lunar Rock is absolutely gorgeous. A few other features I love include keyless entry/ignition, audio, 2 toned color along with the geometric patterned seats, sunroof,  & 5 USB ports. The MPG is impressive & I am grateful for vehicle with AWD."
"04 23, 2021",Sexy - Fun to Drive,This car with the sport program allows me to drive on all surfaces.  The history of Toyota and the RAV4 line are know for quality and service.
"04 20, 2021",Love my new RAV4,"I really like my new RAV4.  I’ve only had it a day, but I think it is going to be just what I wanted.  The only thing that I didn’t realize at the time of purchase was that it didn’t have a function so I could open my garage door.  I really would have liked that."
"04 19, 2021",Very good mileage on gas,Rav 4 has plenty of room and power and great on gas mileage. The comfort level is great with no road noise. Has plenty of room in the rear for hauling luggage and boxes.
"04 19, 2021",very smooth,I love my car nice smooth ride very comfortable  lots of room inside   very nice looking  rich looking  love the color  I just love it
"04 19, 2021",It's okay.,It takes a lot of time to learn the complexities of this vehicle and I'm still learning this vehicle after 2 months. The owners manual has been helpful even it sends to different pages to finally get to the information you need.
"04 19, 2021",Great car. My third RAV4.,"Love the size of the car, the way it rides and it’s reliability. Sorry they dropped the CD player as I am an older buyer used that all the time in my last vehicle."
"04 18, 2021",4th RAV4 in a row.,"Comfort, stylish, roomy, and a smooth ride. I’ve been driving RAV4’s since 2005 and have always been completely satisfied. The technology is amazing too. I would certainly recommend this car."
"04 15, 2021",Most reliable car I own,"Spacious, good gas mileage, drive is smooth. Has wi fi. Comfortable, big, lots of technology features. Good car size and awd. Great safety features such"
"04 15, 2021",Don't like the engine stop and start system.,Overall I do like the toyota rav 4. However I'm not a fan of the on off engine gas saving system. It causes vibration at take off pedal shudder just a rough start after engine start is engaged. Also when putting it in park in the engine on off mode it goes into park real rough. When the system is disabled it doesn't have any of the issues I have mentioned its like a different car. Toyota has some engineering issues with the system that they need to work on. The owners manual says that all the things I mentioned are normal but I don't like it. Had the 2018 rav4 it didn't have that system it drove great and got decent gas mileage
"04 13, 2021",We are content so far. Pretty good purchase,"We went to look at the Hybrid version of Rav4's but we were told that they wouldn't know how soon they'd get them back in stock, so we decided to buy a gasoline version of XLE Premium with all the options and accessories we wanted, the price after tax and fee ended up being over $40K.  We didn't know we could've bought a Limited trim model for such price until we came home with the new Rav4. Oh, well, with all the options and accessories we added, with the Limited, it probably would've gone over $43k, so I guess it was a good purchase.  This Rav4 is a replacement for our aging 2007 BMW 530xi Wagon with now over 210k miles on it.  Compared to the BMW which was $62,7k when we bought it new, the Rav4 has almost everything our BMW has, plus more technology.  Rav4 rides pretty good, it has a solid feel, not very cushy but it's not stiff, either. Only downside compared to the BMW is the sound insulation. Rav4 is a bit louder on freeway than the BMW.  Now the Rav4 has about 550 miles on the odometer, Gas mileage so far has been GREAT at around 32mpg combined as we drive it on freeway a lot more than in the city. The engine sounds quite entertaining(funny), that's probably because we aren't used to hear a 4 cylinder engine sound for 14+ years.  Cargo capacity is great, LED headlights and LED fog lamps are very bright.  We are still learning how new safety technologies work and how to use some stuff. For only a bit over $40k, it has everything we needed in a car, it's a pretty good purchase. We are very happy that we could save quite a bit ($20k to $30k) by switching to Toyota from BMW."
"04 12, 2021","Great SUV, space for my grandkids","This SUV is what I was looking for. It has room for my grandkids. It drives 
really nice. It has a lot of features. I love my sunroof."
"04 11, 2021",Excelente,Es lo máximo todo muy confortable excelente a/c las luces me encanta todo en sentido general muy cómodo los asientos las luces led me encantan
"04  9, 2021","Brand new model for us, so far it's great","We have driven only Toyota's for last 30yrs & all have been  economical, durable and fun to drive. I drove (& still am) driving my 2000 Camry. It was bought 2nd hand 20 yrs ago & has been coast to coast. I'm sure this Rav will too."
"03 31, 2021",BEST RELIABLE CAR EVER,"This car has all of my needs, the special features are unbelievable  & the drive is so smooth. This cat is sexy & comfortable to drive. The gas mileage is out of this world & the trunk has a lot of extra space."
"03 29, 2021",Very nice car,"I love our RAV4. We decided against the hybrid, but they seemed nice too. About the only negative thing I could say about it is that the engine is a bit loud at higher RPM’s, but nothing too crazy. It’s very comfortable and gets good mileage. I anticipate keeping this vehicle for a good 200,000 miles or more."
"03 29, 2021",My forever vehicle,Looking for a smaller vehicle but a suv. Toyota’s r dependable. My husband wanted me to get a Toyota as they will last for a long time.
"03 29, 2021",GOOD CHOICE,"THIS SUV FOLLOWED 8 YEARS DRIVING A QUALITY SEDAN. I LIKED THE HIGHER BODY, INCLUDING SEATING,  THE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE RIDE, ITS RESPOSIVENESS AS A VEHICLE. HAVEN'T DRIVEN IT LONG ENOUGH TO  JUDGE IT FURTHER YET."
"03 28, 2021",First Car I’ve Ever Owned,After doing extensive research and loving the sporty look I knew the RAV4 XLE was one of my top options going into the dealership. Drives great and highly recommend to anyone considering it!
"03 28, 2021",Muy complacido.,"Excelente SUV, cumple con mis expectativas. confort, buen manejo, buen  rendimiento por millas  excelente tecnología, estabilidad, elegante figura, buen power, seguridad. Por  lo que puedo afirmar y recomendar como  un  excelente SUV."

"03 21, 2021",Just bought it. Love it so far!,I love the look inside and outside of the vehicle. Runs great so far. Look forward to  driving it this summer! Love the new sunroof!
"03 21, 2021",Love this car,This car has everything I need.  I am more concerned about safety features than style but my Rav4 XLE has it all.  I am so happy with it.
"03 17, 2021",2021 RAV4 awd,"I had a 2007 Toyota Camry. Had it from new to 2021. No problem. Just regular brake, tires, oil change, etc. I want a suv now. I like reading and look at cars on internet. I look at a hundred reviews of all cars that are in same class and size as the RAV4 . It all came back to Toyota and rav4.  Some reviews were ok and some were great. But with last Toyota Camry experience. I am sticking to what is good and works. And I picked the RAV4.  I did not pick the Toyota Camry. Because it is two inchs lower to ground than my last Camry. Even   though the Camry has awd option."
"03 13, 2021",LOVE the RAV4!,"This is my 2nd RAV4. I love the size, reliability, and look.  Drives great is winter weather.  Our Great Dane mix fits perfectly inside too!   :)"
"03 12, 2021",I love RAV4 because it is always reliable,"It meets all my needs.comfortable,spacious,all wheel drive and best mid size SUV. Fun to drive.good on mileage and good for long drives.Very nice exterior.So lucky to have this car."
"03 11, 2021",Car I own,"This vehicle is more than I thought. The suv is very spacious, has the bells and whistles of a luxury vehicle for the price the comman person could afford. I don’t know why I waited so long. As Leman Toyota is a dealership that will meet all of your needs and wants. You don’t get this experience at the big city dealers."
"03 10, 2021",Best car I have bought,The comfort is great for a smaller car I am a big guy .alot of leg room smooth ride by far the best car I have purchased.
"03 10, 2021",Happy with purchase,I am so far happy with my new car. I am excited about the newer technology and the way it drives. Very pleased to drive a new vehicle.
"03  5, 2021",NEW RAV4 2021  XLE,"So far so good! Still learning the Navigation system- Only had it 4 days!! :)

"03  1, 2021",Coolest Car I've Owned.,"This vehicle's exterior and interior design are stunning. I love the sky silver metallic look of the Rav4. Adjusting the seat on the driver is easy and fun. The car is SUV and higher than a sedan, which works out perfectly for me. I was concerned at first that it would be too small, but you can fold the back seat to make rooms for storage."
"03  1, 2021","Bello mi carro, I love this","Me encanta mi nuevo Carro,  nada como el olor a new car , el color super espectacular, gracias a los trabajadores en especial a la señora Mary Correa por ayudarme en todo el proceso."
"02 25, 2021",Not as many features as my Chevy Silverado,It drives very well in the snow and is roomy. It doesn't have the pick up I'm used to that was in my Chevy Silverado.
"02 25, 2021",It is a fun easy car to drive,This is our 5th RAV4. We like them. They work for us & have grandkids car seats buckled in the back seat. Easy to drive!
"02 24, 2021",Great purchase!,"I love the style of the vehicle, color, has all the bells and whistles I need, along with great gas mileage.    I purchased the Rav4 Adventure and love the look inside and out."
"02 21, 2021",LE feels stripped for such an expensive vehicle,"Seat belt alarm is ridiculous. Toyota must think we're all children. Have to go back to dealer to disable it. Interior should be better. Everything feels cheap and not well designed. TIre valves not long enough. Under hood latch is cheap. Interior lights not bright enough. Horn needs to be louder. Should be able to dim Infotainment screen. I was expecting more for a $30,000 vehicle. Thin hard plastic steering wheel should have told me all I needed to know. It better be a trouble free vehicle. After 26+ years, it should be better!"
"02 19, 2021",DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH,This was by far the best car purchase I have ever made! Very satisfied!! Feels like driving on clouds. Do not have to tank up so frequently.
"02 17, 2021",Love my vehicle,"Love how this car meets all of my needs. Very spacious and love all of the bells and whistles. I especially love the heated steering wheel, especially in the wintertime."
"02  7, 2021",This is a good car for us I always use Toyota cars,This car meets all my needs it is why I asked for to Yury Vazquez and it’s what I get from him. I’m very happy with the experience and the only thing is the interior 💺 that after all yesterday I tell my husband that I forget about the vynel seats because it’s more protection for the seats.But anyway I’m very happy with my car 🚗.
"02  7, 2021",Good car for me and my family.,"I like it.My kids like it.We are happy with the car,good to go. I like outside and inside the only thing was that I like the vinyl seats but for now one is ok ✅ we can handle it."
"02  7, 2021",Great Vehicle,"This is the 2nd RAV4 I've owned.  I really like the improvements they've made from the 2016 to the 2021 models.  It's fun to drive, handles well under all road conditions and gets great gas mileage."
"02  6, 2021",Most comfortable car  I ever owed,"Feel very safe. Beautiful interior and exterior, useful  equipment. Low gas usage. 
I will definitely recommend my family and friends RAV4 2021.  Most comfortable car I ever had a chance to drive."
"02  1, 2021",I love it,It’s got tons of room. The design is beautiful. I love the color Luna rock. It’s a great family car. I love that the seat can boot up.
"01 28, 2021",Great car,Very nice car. Good value. Nice options. Great color.  Comfortable. Good runnner. Just what I had hoped for in a new car.  Affordable luxury transportation.
"01 23, 2021",The car  met all my needs.,"Love the gas mileage  on it. And the car is very comforter ,space,and elegant.  Love that it connect  my phone using the bluetooth  not a Aux cord."
"01 23, 2021",This is my First Rav 4,Needs more horse power.  The ride is a little more bumpy going over holes in the road than expected.  Passenger seat does not go back far enough for tall people
"01 11, 2021",I love my new car,This car was what I wanted. It has all the positive aspects  of a safe and reliable  vehicle. Well designed and very comfortable.  I am very happy.
"01 11, 2021",Living my new Toyota,This Suv met my needs with a nice body style. Also has upgraded technology from a lot of usb ports and new computer monitor with apple play. It has a smooth drive and leg room for the family
"01  8, 2021",even better than my 2018!,This 2021 was very similar to my 2018 but a few extra standard features like power driver seat. unfortunately does not have front and rear bumper alerts
"01  4, 2021",This is our 3rd Toyota and the only kind we’ll own,"This is my forever vehicle, I love how it rides, plenty of room especially the back seat, it fits 2 car seats and still room for a person to sit. Drives and handles great, a big bonus was the weather tech floor mats!"
"01  4, 2021",Nice to get a new Rav4,"It meets our need for a new car at an affordable price. Some newer technology but not overload.  Does not have CD player or power seats and doors which I will miss. Seats are comfortable seem small but I am going from a Chrysler van to A Rav 4. We traded in a 2007 Rav 4 so we are use to the size and we also still have our van so it not a big change..  
Great gas mileage so far ,nice ride and handles well also.  Love that it has AWD , phone capabilities plus more.  Beautiful car easy to learn new technology."
"01  2, 2021",Comfortable and convenient,"The newer designs really load up on features, and keep you up on technology. The RAV4 comes in various packages depending on your needs. And you can easily get features added for the most part. The only minor issue is that the charging and data ports are still all USB-A and 2.5A. Wish they had the newer USB-C and fast-charge ports. I did get the wireless charging pad though."
"01  2, 2021",Second. Rav 4 Ihaveowned.,Second Rav 4 I have owned.  Wont drive any other SUV .  Great vehicle for the money.  Lovethesafety features.  Love thenewbody style.  Love the new color.

"11 30, 2020",The car is nice.,It is good.  A little sluggish.  Transmission could be smoother.  Covers everything I was looking for.  The door arm rest could use more padding.  Cenre re console is a little tight on the right leg.
"11 29, 2020",Great gas mileage,"The RAV4 is great on gas mileage. I am use to driving something bigger, so it is an adjustment for me. It is roomy & the technology is taking some getting used to. Overall, it is a great vehicle."
"11 28, 2020",Most reliable car,"This car is excellent,  the best of the best,  I am very happy,  I will recommend this car to everyone, I feel I am driving an airplane."
"11  8, 2020",A cut above,"Totally surprised me as to the amenities and functions, while providing a spacious and comfortable ride, totally worth a serious look to see if it fits your needs."
"11  2, 2020","Very reliable. Love all the safety features,",This car meets all of my needs. Love the body style and how roomy it is. Love all of the safety features that are standard on this vehicle.
"11  1, 2020",Love it!,"It's just the right car for me.. Fun, sporty, comfy! It makes me want to roadtrip! And it gets great mileage so I'll be Roadtripping for sure!"
"10 29, 2020",This car has everything!,"This car has so many features. Love the heated seats and steering wheel,
automatic lift/closure of back door, just everything! It is large enough to haul things and yet small enough t maneuver and park."
"10 21, 2020",This is my fourth Rav 4 (7th Toyota) in a row,"The car fits my needs in terms of comfort and performance.  My dogs fit comfortably, I never worry about mechanical issues, it is beautiful, a joy to drive, and I love all the “bells and whistles”!  7 Toyota cars in a row with NEVER an issue or complaint.  I am proud to be a Toyota owner.
The color lunar rock is spectacular.  The sound system amazing and heated steering wheel a blessing!"
"10 20, 2020",I LOVE my new vehicle!,"I love my Rav4! It has so many features and drives so well. It's a dream on the highway and in city driving. And, the sound system is perfect as I love music!"
"10  6, 2020",Very reliable car.,This car is just perfect for driving to and from work. It is very comfortable. I love the all the new  upgrade that was done for the 2021 make. I love the color of the vehicle too.
"12 14, 2022",Everything is good except for power,I’ve owned this car for a year and put 20k miles on it (2021 Toyota RAV4) and everything on it is fairly decent except the engine and transmission I live on a mountain so there are lots of hills and curves and the transmission is DEFINITELY not geared for hilly terrain or maybe it’s the weak Mickey Mouse motor either way there appears to be a delay when you push the pedal down (it’s almost gotten me t-boned pulling out of a business onto the busy town road because it took so long to take off) so if your wanting something with remotely any power DO NOT get this car looking back now I would trade the decent gas mileage for a little more power and maybe it’s just my dodge Cummins I’m used to but this thing is weak sauce when it comes to the motor and power when you need it!
"11  1, 2022",Car was certified when we bought it.,We are not happy! We hit a small bump on any Pa road and it feels horrible!! No smooth ride. No power! No beeps for lane changing. Gas mileage is horrible! My daughter has a large suv and we followed them to Fl and back and it cost me more for gas! She has a Traverse. Never again.
"08 22, 2022",It’s Good & It’s Not So,I purchased a new 21 Limited with the Advanced Tech package And Limited Grade All Weather package.                             Its very very loud under acceleration. The highway  pavement noise and wind noise are barely tolerable. I have a bad back the seats are fantastic and I have a bad back they are great on long trips. Constantly Averaging 28mpg it’s dependable and I know it will hold its value.
"06  2, 2022",I love Rav4,"A little too big for myself but I love this car.
I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again."
"05 29, 2022",Best bang for the buck,I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.
"05 25, 2022",I love my Rav4,"Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.
Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also."
"04  7, 2022",RAV4 Limited,"Purchased the vehicle new and have had EXCELLENT gas milage, no problems at all, cargo space is almost as spacious as a Lexus RX350 and it is NON-turbocharged.    Performance and acceleration is extremely good for a 4 cylinder engine.
I would recommend it to anyone."
"06 12, 2021",Dude it’s a Toyota!,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I’ve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I’ll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
"06 10, 2021",Great ride,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
"06  9, 2021",We only buy Toyota always,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it’s fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
"06  8, 2021",Great Toyota SUV; Acceleration hesitation at 5 mo.,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
"06  8, 2021",Too soon to tell,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
"05 30, 2021",I love this vehicle.,I feel safe and very comfortable in my “Limited” rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can’t wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
"05 26, 2021",The best Mid size SUV you could buy!,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
"05 24, 2021",Best  car I’ve ever owned!,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
"05 22, 2021",3rd Rav4 we've had.,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
"05 13, 2021",not compliant,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
"05 12, 2021",The best car,"im in love with this car, i really recommend this car to a friend and family. 
the most beautiful car and is so comfortable car."
"05 11, 2021",Wonderful small suv,"this is my 2nd Rav 4 my 1st was a red one 2015. Loved that car too. 
Only complaint I have is the the lack of space in the front. And the red color had changed. Now I have a white Rav and it is classy and beautifully dramatic!"
"05 10, 2021",My second RAV4,"The 2021 RAV4 Premium is a great value.  Performance is adequate, with ease of driving and maintaining  being optimum.  Its a very comfortable SUV for gaining access and exit from the interior. The RAV4 is easy to drive, plus it's quite comfortable on longer trips.  Fuel mileage is quite good also, with the mid-30s in mpgs. This last generation has a very good rugged look, resembling a 4-Runner.  I highly recommend it."
"05  7, 2021",Love Love Love,I love my new RAV4 it is so user friendly the drive is amazing and I have all the safety features I got the Lunar Rock color and I love it
"05  3, 2021",Toyota’s are the best!,I’ve been driving them since 1970.  I Learned how to drive a stick shift on my 1970 Corolla.  Their cars are very reliable and I feel so safe driving in one.
"05  2, 2021",I’m getting used to the Eco Features,My CRV died. Had to get a new used car quick. All I could find was high mileage high price. So decided to go with a lease because I just can’t deal with bad service anymore. Earl Stewart has an excellent reputation for service. I miss all the cup holders and the extra storage layer of the CRV and the space to put my purse. Not sure I’ll keep the RAV4 after 3 years.
"04 29, 2021",Absolutely amazing value for the money!,"Car has so far met all of my needs, loving the Apple play feature! I think it’s perfect! Very spacious! I’m ready to blast through the snow with this beast!"
"04 27, 2021",Nice car,The Rav 4 LE is easy to drive/handles well and is great on gas.  Sufficient legroom in the back seat.  Nice looking exterior and interior.
"04 27, 2021",BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,GREAT SUV VERY ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE BIG SCREEN FOR GPS AND SOUND SYSTEM AMAZING HAS SYM MUSIC GREAT OVERALL AND A FAM CAR THATS THE BEST PART.
"04 26, 2021",First “Brand New” Car,"Purchased brand new on March 31. My first new car purchase - others in past purchased used.

Excellent vehicle and with incentives/financing, excellent value. This is my 2nd RAV4. Currently own a 2011 model as well. Love both!

Only complaint is the headrest. Feels like I am resting my head against a rock! Otherwise great!"
"04 25, 2021",Gorgeous Color!,"The car met and exceeded all my needs. The color, Lunar Rock is absolutely gorgeous. A few other features I love include keyless entry/ignition, audio, 2 toned color along with the geometric patterned seats, sunroof,  & 5 USB ports. The MPG is impressive & I am grateful for vehicle with AWD."
"04 23, 2021",Sexy - Fun to Drive,This car with the sport program allows me to drive on all surfaces.  The history of Toyota and the RAV4 line are know for quality and service.
"04 20, 2021",Love my new RAV4,"I really like my new RAV4.  I’ve only had it a day, but I think it is going to be just what I wanted.  The only thing that I didn’t realize at the time of purchase was that it didn’t have a function so I could open my garage door.  I really would have liked that."
"04 19, 2021",Very good mileage on gas,Rav 4 has plenty of room and power and great on gas mileage. The comfort level is great with no road noise. Has plenty of room in the rear for hauling luggage and boxes.
"04 19, 2021",very smooth,I love my car nice smooth ride very comfortable  lots of room inside   very nice looking  rich looking  love the color  I just love it
"04 19, 2021",It's okay.,It takes a lot of time to learn the complexities of this vehicle and I'm still learning this vehicle after 2 months. The owners manual has been helpful even it sends to different pages to finally get to the information you need.
"04 19, 2021",Great car. My third RAV4.,"Love the size of the car, the way it rides and it’s reliability. Sorry they dropped the CD player as I am an older buyer used that all the time in my last vehicle."
"04 18, 2021",4th RAV4 in a row.,"Comfort, stylish, roomy, and a smooth ride. I’ve been driving RAV4’s since 2005 and have always been completely satisfied. The technology is amazing too. I would certainly recommend this car."
"04 15, 2021",Most reliable car I own,"Spacious, good gas mileage, drive is smooth. Has wi fi. Comfortable, big, lots of technology features. Good car size and awd. Great safety features such"
"04 15, 2021",Don't like the engine stop and start system.,Overall I do like the toyota rav 4. However I'm not a fan of the on off engine gas saving system. It causes vibration at take off pedal shudder just a rough start after engine start is engaged. Also when putting it in park in the engine on off mode it goes into park real rough. When the system is disabled it doesn't have any of the issues I have mentioned its like a different car. Toyota has some engineering issues with the system that they need to work on. The owners manual says that all the things I mentioned are normal but I don't like it. Had the 2018 rav4 it didn't have that system it drove great and got decent gas mileage
"04 13, 2021",We are content so far. Pretty good purchase,"We went to look at the Hybrid version of Rav4's but we were told that they wouldn't know how soon they'd get them back in stock, so we decided to buy a gasoline version of XLE Premium with all the options and accessories we wanted, the price after tax and fee ended up being over $40K.  We didn't know we could've bought a Limited trim model for such price until we came home with the new Rav4. Oh, well, with all the options and accessories we added, with the Limited, it probably would've gone over $43k, so I guess it was a good purchase.  This Rav4 is a replacement for our aging 2007 BMW 530xi Wagon with now over 210k miles on it.  Compared to the BMW which was $62,7k when we bought it new, the Rav4 has almost everything our BMW has, plus more technology.  Rav4 rides pretty good, it has a solid feel, not very cushy but it's not stiff, either. Only downside compared to the BMW is the sound insulation. Rav4 is a bit louder on freeway than the BMW.  Now the Rav4 has about 550 miles on the odometer, Gas mileage so far has been GREAT at around 32mpg combined as we drive it on freeway a lot more than in the city. The engine sounds quite entertaining(funny), that's probably because we aren't used to hear a 4 cylinder engine sound for 14+ years.  Cargo capacity is great, LED headlights and LED fog lamps are very bright.  We are still learning how new safety technologies work and how to use some stuff. For only a bit over $40k, it has everything we needed in a car, it's a pretty good purchase. We are very happy that we could save quite a bit ($20k to $30k) by switching to Toyota from BMW."
"04 12, 2021","Great SUV, space for my grandkids","This SUV is what I was looking for. It has room for my grandkids. It drives 
really nice. It has a lot of features. I love my sunroof."
"04 11, 2021",Excelente,Es lo máximo todo muy confortable excelente a/c las luces me encanta todo en sentido general muy cómodo los asientos las luces led me encantan
"04  9, 2021","Brand new model for us, so far it's great","We have driven only Toyota's for last 30yrs & all have been  economical, durable and fun to drive. I drove (& still am) driving my 2000 Camry. It was bought 2nd hand 20 yrs ago & has been coast to coast. I'm sure this Rav will too."
"03 31, 2021",BEST RELIABLE CAR EVER,"This car has all of my needs, the special features are unbelievable  & the drive is so smooth. This cat is sexy & comfortable to drive. The gas mileage is out of this world & the trunk has a lot of extra space."
"03 29, 2021",Very nice car,"I love our RAV4. We decided against the hybrid, but they seemed nice too. About the only negative thing I could say about it is that the engine is a bit loud at higher RPM’s, but nothing too crazy. It’s very comfortable and gets good mileage. I anticipate keeping this vehicle for a good 200,000 miles or more."
"03 29, 2021",My forever vehicle,Looking for a smaller vehicle but a suv. Toyota’s r dependable. My husband wanted me to get a Toyota as they will last for a long time.
"03 29, 2021",GOOD CHOICE,"THIS SUV FOLLOWED 8 YEARS DRIVING A QUALITY SEDAN. I LIKED THE HIGHER BODY, INCLUDING SEATING,  THE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE RIDE, ITS RESPOSIVENESS AS A VEHICLE. HAVEN'T DRIVEN IT LONG ENOUGH TO  JUDGE IT FURTHER YET."
"03 28, 2021",First Car I’ve Ever Owned,After doing extensive research and loving the sporty look I knew the RAV4 XLE was one of my top options going into the dealership. Drives great and highly recommend to anyone considering it!
"03 28, 2021",Muy complacido.,"Excelente SUV, cumple con mis expectativas. confort, buen manejo, buen  rendimiento por millas  excelente tecnología, estabilidad, elegante figura, buen power, seguridad. Por  lo que puedo afirmar y recomendar como  un  excelente SUV."

"03 24, 2021",Exceeded my expectations,"More than I hoped for! Still trying to figure out all of the electronics, but it's just a matter of finding the time. Totally love it!"
"03 21, 2021",Just bought it. Love it so far!,I love the look inside and outside of the vehicle. Runs great so far. Look forward to  driving it this summer! Love the new sunroof!
"03 21, 2021",Love this car,This car has everything I need.  I am more concerned about safety features than style but my Rav4 XLE has it all.  I am so happy with it.
"03 17, 2021",2021 RAV4 awd,"I had a 2007 Toyota Camry. Had it from new to 2021. No problem. Just regular brake, tires, oil change, etc. I want a suv now. I like reading and look at cars on internet. I look at a hundred reviews of all cars that are in same class and size as the RAV4 . It all came back to Toyota and rav4.  Some reviews were ok and some were great. But with last Toyota Camry experience. I am sticking to what is good and works. And I picked the RAV4.  I did not pick the Toyota Camry. Because it is two inchs lower to ground than my last Camry. Even   though the Camry has awd option."
"03 13, 2021",LOVE the RAV4!,"This is my 2nd RAV4. I love the size, reliability, and look.  Drives great is winter weather.  Our Great Dane mix fits perfectly inside too!   :)"
"03 12, 2021",I love RAV4 because it is always reliable,"It meets all my needs.comfortable,spacious,all wheel drive and best mid size SUV. Fun to drive.good on mileage and good for long drives.Very nice exterior.So lucky to have this car."
"03 11, 2021",Car I own,"This vehicle is more than I thought. The suv is very spacious, has the bells and whistles of a luxury vehicle for the price the comman person could afford. I don’t know why I waited so long. As Leman Toyota is a dealership that will meet all of your needs and wants. You don’t get this experience at the big city dealers."
"03 10, 2021",Best car I have bought,The comfort is great for a smaller car I am a big guy .alot of leg room smooth ride by far the best car I have purchased.
"03 10, 2021",Happy with purchase,I am so far happy with my new car. I am excited about the newer technology and the way it drives. Very pleased to drive a new vehicle.
"03  5, 2021",NEW RAV4 2021  XLE,"So far so good! Still learning the Navigation system- Only had it 4 days!! :)
Love the SUNROOF/MOON-ROOF! Never had one!
Has good engine pickup for being a 2.5L."

"03  1, 2021",Coolest Car I've Owned.,"This vehicle's exterior and interior design are stunning. I love the sky silver metallic look of the Rav4. Adjusting the seat on the driver is easy and fun. The car is SUV and higher than a sedan, which works out perfectly for me. I was concerned at first that it would be too small, but you can fold the back seat to make rooms for storage."
"03  1, 2021","Bello mi carro, I love this","Me encanta mi nuevo Carro,  nada como el olor a new car , el color super espectacular, gracias a los trabajadores en especial a la señora Mary Correa por ayudarme en todo el proceso."
"02 25, 2021",Not as many features as my Chevy Silverado,It drives very well in the snow and is roomy. It doesn't have the pick up I'm used to that was in my Chevy Silverado.
"02 25, 2021",It is a fun easy car to drive,This is our 5th RAV4. We like them. They work for us & have grandkids car seats buckled in the back seat. Easy to drive!
"02 24, 2021",Great purchase!,"I love the style of the vehicle, color, has all the bells and whistles I need, along with great gas mileage.    I purchased the Rav4 Adventure and love the look inside and out."
"02 21, 2021",LE feels stripped for such an expensive vehicle,"Seat belt alarm is ridiculous. Toyota must think we're all children. Have to go back to dealer to disable it. Interior should be better. Everything feels cheap and not well designed. TIre valves not long enough. Under hood latch is cheap. Interior lights not bright enough. Horn needs to be louder. Should be able to dim Infotainment screen. I was expecting more for a $30,000 vehicle. Thin hard plastic steering wheel should have told me all I needed to know. It better be a trouble free vehicle. After 26+ years, it should be better!"
"02 19, 2021",DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH,This was by far the best car purchase I have ever made! Very satisfied!! Feels like driving on clouds. Do not have to tank up so frequently.
"02 17, 2021",Love my vehicle,"Love how this car meets all of my needs. Very spacious and love all of the bells and whistles. I especially love the heated steering wheel, especially in the wintertime."
"02  7, 2021",This is a good car for us I always use Toyota cars,This car meets all my needs it is why I asked for to Yury Vazquez and it’s what I get from him. I’m very happy with the experience and the only thing is the interior 💺 that after all yesterday I tell my husband that I forget about the vynel seats because it’s more protection for the seats.But anyway I’m very happy with my car 🚗.
"02  7, 2021",Good car for me and my family.,"I like it.My kids like it.We are happy with the car,good to go. I like outside and inside the only thing was that I like the vinyl seats but for now one is ok ✅ we can handle it."
"02  7, 2021",Great Vehicle,"This is the 2nd RAV4 I've owned.  I really like the improvements they've made from the 2016 to the 2021 models.  It's fun to drive, handles well under all road conditions and gets great gas mileage."
"02  6, 2021",Most comfortable car  I ever owed,"Feel very safe. Beautiful interior and exterior, useful  equipment. Low gas usage. 
I will definitely recommend my family and friends RAV4 2021.  Most comfortable car I ever had a chance to drive."
"02  1, 2021",I love it,It’s got tons of room. The design is beautiful. I love the color Luna rock. It’s a great family car. I love that the seat can boot up.
"01 28, 2021",Great car,Very nice car. Good value. Nice options. Great color.  Comfortable. Good runnner. Just what I had hoped for in a new car.  Affordable luxury transportation.
"01 23, 2021",The car  met all my needs.,"Love the gas mileage  on it. And the car is very comforter ,space,and elegant.  Love that it connect  my phone using the bluetooth  not a Aux cord."
"01 23, 2021",This is my First Rav 4,Needs more horse power.  The ride is a little more bumpy going over holes in the road than expected.  Passenger seat does not go back far enough for tall people
"01 11, 2021",I love my new car,This car was what I wanted. It has all the positive aspects  of a safe and reliable  vehicle. Well designed and very comfortable.  I am very happy.
"01 11, 2021",Living my new Toyota,This Suv met my needs with a nice body style. Also has upgraded technology from a lot of usb ports and new computer monitor with apple play. It has a smooth drive and leg room for the family
"01  8, 2021",even better than my 2018!,This 2021 was very similar to my 2018 but a few extra standard features like power driver seat. unfortunately does not have front and rear bumper alerts
"01  4, 2021",This is our 3rd Toyota and the only kind we’ll own,"This is my forever vehicle, I love how it rides, plenty of room especially the back seat, it fits 2 car seats and still room for a person to sit. Drives and handles great, a big bonus was the weather tech floor mats!"
"01  4, 2021",Nice to get a new Rav4,"It meets our need for a new car at an affordable price. Some newer technology but not overload.  Does not have CD player or power seats and doors which I will miss. Seats are comfortable seem small but I am going from a Chrysler van to A Rav 4. We traded in a 2007 Rav 4 so we are use to the size and we also still have our van so it not a big change..  
Great gas mileage so far ,nice ride and handles well also.  Love that it has AWD , phone capabilities plus more.  Beautiful car easy to learn new technology."
"01  2, 2021",Comfortable and convenient,"The newer designs really load up on features, and keep you up on technology. The RAV4 comes in various packages depending on your needs. And you can easily get features added for the most part. The only minor issue is that the charging and data ports are still all USB-A and 2.5A. Wish they had the newer USB-C and fast-charge ports. I did get the wireless charging pad though."
"01  2, 2021",Second. Rav 4 Ihaveowned.,Second Rav 4 I have owned.  Wont drive any other SUV .  Great vehicle for the money.  Lovethesafety features.  Love thenewbody style.  Love the new color.

"12 31, 2020",I was looking for an affordable yet sporty looking,This vehicle has all the blows and whistles I was looking for in an SUV.  I’ve never owned a Toyota but did my research and decided on a RAV4.  Very impressed with all the blows and whistles it comes with!!
"12 30, 2020",Most comfortable car I've ever owned.,"This vehicle is comfortable  , economical and safe. A good purchase for price. This vehicle looks very elegant , spacious and easy to navegate. This is my second rav4."
"12 29, 2020",A perfect size.,"It meets the needs for us being retired. Easy to drive, enter and exit the vehicle. Automatic hatch is great. Dual air and heat is terrific. The backseat is very good to ride in."
"12 27, 2020",First new car I've owned,"Easy to drive and being a Limited, has lots of sensors making for a safer drive. Love driving this car. The only criticism is how far I have to duck my head to get into the seat."
"12  4, 2020",Best car I've owned so far,The vehicle is a great car it has all the amenities i need in a car and the gas on it is great looks sporty and classy and a great vehicle all around
"12  3, 2020",Compré la RAV4 2021,"Compré la RAV4 2021 XLE. La guagua cubre mi necesidad de un vehículo espacioso, alto y moderno. Tiene buen rendimiento de gasolina y te da seguridad. Recomendada"
"12  3, 2020",Best vehicle,This is my second Rav4 and I Love it! It's just the right size and the price is great. They made the process stress free! Thank you!
"11 30, 2020",The car is nice.,It is good.  A little sluggish.  Transmission could be smoother.  Covers everything I was looking for.  The door arm rest could use more padding.  Cenre re console is a little tight on the right leg.
"11 29, 2020",Great gas mileage,"The RAV4 is great on gas mileage. I am use to driving something bigger, so it is an adjustment for me. It is roomy & the technology is taking some getting used to. Overall, it is a great vehicle."
"11 28, 2020",Most reliable car,"This car is excellent,  the best of the best,  I am very happy,  I will recommend this car to everyone, I feel I am driving an airplane."
"11  8, 2020",A cut above,"Totally surprised me as to the amenities and functions, while providing a spacious and comfortable ride, totally worth a serious look to see if it fits your needs."
"11  2, 2020","Very reliable. Love all the safety features,",This car meets all of my needs. Love the body style and how roomy it is. Love all of the safety features that are standard on this vehicle.
"11  1, 2020",Love it!,"It's just the right car for me.. Fun, sporty, comfy! It makes me want to roadtrip! And it gets great mileage so I'll be Roadtripping for sure!"
"10 29, 2020",This car has everything!,"This car has so many features. Love the heated seats and steering wheel,
automatic lift/closure of back door, just everything! It is large enough to haul things and yet small enough t maneuver and park."
"10 21, 2020",This is my fourth Rav 4 (7th Toyota) in a row,"The car fits my needs in terms of comfort and performance.  My dogs fit comfortably, I never worry about mechanical issues, it is beautiful, a joy to drive, and I love all the “bells and whistles”!  7 Toyota cars in a row with NEVER an issue or complaint.  I am proud to be a Toyota owner.
The color lunar rock is spectacular.  The sound system amazing and heated steering wheel a blessing!"
"10 20, 2020",I LOVE my new vehicle!,"I love my Rav4! It has so many features and drives so well. It's a dream on the highway and in city driving. And, the sound system is perfect as I love music!"
"10  6, 2020",Very reliable car.,This car is just perfect for driving to and from work. It is very comfortable. I love the all the new  upgrade that was done for the 2021 make. I love the color of the vehicle too.
"12 14, 2022",Everything is good except for power,I’ve owned this car for a year and put 20k miles on it (2021 Toyota RAV4) and everything on it is fairly decent except the engine and transmission I live on a mountain so there are lots of hills and curves and the transmission is DEFINITELY not geared for hilly terrain or maybe it’s the weak Mickey Mouse motor either way there appears to be a delay when you push the pedal down (it’s almost gotten me t-boned pulling out of a business onto the busy town road because it took so long to take off) so if your wanting something with remotely any power DO NOT get this car looking back now I would trade the decent gas mileage for a little more power and maybe it’s just my dodge Cummins I’m used to but this thing is weak sauce when it comes to the motor and power when you need it!
"11  1, 2022",Car was certified when we bought it.,We are not happy! We hit a small bump on any Pa road and it feels horrible!! No smooth ride. No power! No beeps for lane changing. Gas mileage is horrible! My daughter has a large suv and we followed them to Fl and back and it cost me more for gas! She has a Traverse. Never again.
"08 22, 2022",It’s Good & It’s Not So,I purchased a new 21 Limited with the Advanced Tech package And Limited Grade All Weather package.                             Its very very loud under acceleration. The highway  pavement noise and wind noise are barely tolerable. I have a bad back the seats are fantastic and I have a bad back they are great on long trips. Constantly Averaging 28mpg it’s dependable and I know it will hold its value.
"06  2, 2022",I love Rav4,"A little too big for myself but I love this car.
I had a used Rav4 before, drove about 10 years, loved it. Also I was able to sell it pretty high price ($4,500) comparing the year and the mileage (over 200,0000 miles). So that is one of the reason why I bought Rav4 again."
"05 29, 2022",Best bang for the buck,I've have a Rav 4 premium wich was purchased in feb2021.ive had zero problems and the car accelerates like a rx350 which I cannot understand where people want to tell you the car is slow . the car was purchased because of extreme back problems which I am on disabled for.the car does everything as well as my dad's girlfriend's 2017 Rx 350.the gas mileage is amazing.
"05 25, 2022",I love my Rav4,"Amazing performance for a 4 cylinder. First time I ever owned something without a V8, and I am impressed.
Good handling. great interior and very comfortable. Good MPG also."
"04  7, 2022",RAV4 Limited,"Purchased the vehicle new and have had EXCELLENT gas milage, no problems at all, cargo space is almost as spacious as a Lexus RX350 and it is NON-turbocharged.    Performance and acceleration is extremely good for a 4 cylinder engine.
I would recommend it to anyone."
"06 12, 2021",Dude it’s a Toyota!,"This is the 5th Toyota I have own. Toyota knows how to make a product that last, looks good, rides amazing, and will turn heads for years to come. I’ve own the RAV for just a few days but look forward to years of enjoyment and feel I’ll be able to hand it down to my 7 year old daughter in about 9 years."
"06 10, 2021",Great ride,"The 2021 RAV4 is a real treat. It is large enough to be extremely comfortable; even in the back seat, and small enough to be practical. It rides like my Avalon yet has plenty of space in the back to be able to haul things like beach chairs and coolers. Great car."
"06  9, 2021",We only buy Toyota always,Meets all our needs love air in backseat so far it’s fantastic great room in way back love auto open back hatch love trunk cover and automatic power driver seat
"06  8, 2021",Great Toyota SUV; Acceleration hesitation at 5 mo.,"Overall, love this 2021 XLE Rav4 as I did the 2018; including the new features.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the gas saving feature of engine stop when idling with break, has a very rough restart to pull away.  Also, I now have a maddeningly pronounced hesitation of 1-2 seconds before acceleration from a stop or slower speed.  This is a safety problem when merging in heavy traffic.  Hopefully can be adjusted at next checkup."
"06  8, 2021",Too soon to tell,"I was looking for a compact SUV. Didn't need all the bells and  whistles.  Its sporty looking fun, and I am excited about the gas mileage"
"05 30, 2021",I love this vehicle.,I feel safe and very comfortable in my “Limited” rav 4. I am getting ready to drive across country and can’t wait to do so in my beautiful RAV4!
"05 26, 2021",The best Mid size SUV you could buy!,Absolutely love it after comparing it to so many and actually taking the time for the purchase the RAV4 was by far the best. Perfect size for extra room and still midsize.
"05 24, 2021",Best  car I’ve ever owned!,This car fits all my needs! It is spacious and stylish. I was and am impressed with all the safety features in this vehicle. Apple car play is a plus!  10/10 would recommend!
"05 22, 2021",3rd Rav4 we've had.,Like the way it drives an the safety features. The seats are comfortable. The  backup camera is nice. The  AWD is great for going off road.
"05 13, 2021",not compliant,"The exterior of the vehicle meets the expectations, the performance and the interior but the accident prevention system (PCS) does not work, so that you receive a warning you must first have the accident. What is the use of a system that is to prevent and can not even warn you before and the worst you are paying for it."
"05 12, 2021",The best car,"im in love with this car, i really recommend this car to a friend and family. 
the most beautiful car and is so comfortable car."
"05 11, 2021",Wonderful small suv,"this is my 2nd Rav 4 my 1st was a red one 2015. Loved that car too. 
Only complaint I have is the the lack of space in the front. And the red color had changed. Now I have a white Rav and it is classy and beautifully dramatic!"
"05 10, 2021",My second RAV4,"The 2021 RAV4 Premium is a great value.  Performance is adequate, with ease of driving and maintaining  being optimum.  Its a very comfortable SUV for gaining access and exit from the interior. The RAV4 is easy to drive, plus it's quite comfortable on longer trips.  Fuel mileage is quite good also, with the mid-30s in mpgs. This last generation has a very good rugged look, resembling a 4-Runner.  I highly recommend it."
"05  7, 2021",Love Love Love,I love my new RAV4 it is so user friendly the drive is amazing and I have all the safety features I got the Lunar Rock color and I love it
"05  3, 2021",Toyota’s are the best!,I’ve been driving them since 1970.  I Learned how to drive a stick shift on my 1970 Corolla.  Their cars are very reliable and I feel so safe driving in one.
"05  2, 2021",I’m getting used to the Eco Features,My CRV died. Had to get a new used car quick. All I could find was high mileage high price. So decided to go with a lease because I just can’t deal with bad service anymore. Earl Stewart has an excellent reputation for service. I miss all the cup holders and the extra storage layer of the CRV and the space to put my purse. Not sure I’ll keep the RAV4 after 3 years.
"04 29, 2021",Absolutely amazing value for the money!,"Car has so far met all of my needs, loving the Apple play feature! I think it’s perfect! Very spacious! I’m ready to blast through the snow with this beast!"
"04 27, 2021",Nice car,The Rav 4 LE is easy to drive/handles well and is great on gas.  Sufficient legroom in the back seat.  Nice looking exterior and interior.
"04 27, 2021",BETTER THAN MY OLD ONE,GREAT SUV VERY ROOMY AND COMFORTABLE BIG SCREEN FOR GPS AND SOUND SYSTEM AMAZING HAS SYM MUSIC GREAT OVERALL AND A FAM CAR THATS THE BEST PART.
"04 26, 2021",First “Brand New” Car,"Purchased brand new on March 31. My first new car purchase - others in past purchased used.

Excellent vehicle and with incentives/financing, excellent value. This is my 2nd RAV4. Currently own a 2011 model as well. Love both!

Only complaint is the headrest. Feels like I am resting my head against a rock! Otherwise great!"
"04 25, 2021",Gorgeous Color!,"The car met and exceeded all my needs. The color, Lunar Rock is absolutely gorgeous. A few other features I love include keyless entry/ignition, audio, 2 toned color along with the geometric patterned seats, sunroof,  & 5 USB ports. The MPG is impressive & I am grateful for vehicle with AWD."
"04 23, 2021",Sexy - Fun to Drive,This car with the sport program allows me to drive on all surfaces.  The history of Toyota and the RAV4 line are know for quality and service.
"04 20, 2021",Love my new RAV4,"I really like my new RAV4.  I’ve only had it a day, but I think it is going to be just what I wanted.  The only thing that I didn’t realize at the time of purchase was that it didn’t have a function so I could open my garage door.  I really would have liked that."
"04 19, 2021",Very good mileage on gas,Rav 4 has plenty of room and power and great on gas mileage. The comfort level is great with no road noise. Has plenty of room in the rear for hauling luggage and boxes.
"04 19, 2021",very smooth,I love my car nice smooth ride very comfortable  lots of room inside   very nice looking  rich looking  love the color  I just love it
"04 19, 2021",It's okay.,It takes a lot of time to learn the complexities of this vehicle and I'm still learning this vehicle after 2 months. The owners manual has been helpful even it sends to different pages to finally get to the information you need.
"04 19, 2021",Great car. My third RAV4.,"Love the size of the car, the way it rides and it’s reliability. Sorry they dropped the CD player as I am an older buyer used that all the time in my last vehicle."
"04 18, 2021",4th RAV4 in a row.,"Comfort, stylish, roomy, and a smooth ride. I’ve been driving RAV4’s since 2005 and have always been completely satisfied. The technology is amazing too. I would certainly recommend this car."
"04 15, 2021",Most reliable car I own,"Spacious, good gas mileage, drive is smooth. Has wi fi. Comfortable, big, lots of technology features. Good car size and awd. Great safety features such"
"04 15, 2021",Don't like the engine stop and start system.,Overall I do like the toyota rav 4. However I'm not a fan of the on off engine gas saving system. It causes vibration at take off pedal shudder just a rough start after engine start is engaged. Also when putting it in park in the engine on off mode it goes into park real rough. When the system is disabled it doesn't have any of the issues I have mentioned its like a different car. Toyota has some engineering issues with the system that they need to work on. The owners manual says that all the things I mentioned are normal but I don't like it. Had the 2018 rav4 it didn't have that system it drove great and got decent gas mileage
"04 13, 2021",We are content so far. Pretty good purchase,"We went to look at the Hybrid version of Rav4's but we were told that they wouldn't know how soon they'd get them back in stock, so we decided to buy a gasoline version of XLE Premium with all the options and accessories we wanted, the price after tax and fee ended up being over $40K.  We didn't know we could've bought a Limited trim model for such price until we came home with the new Rav4. Oh, well, with all the options and accessories we added, with the Limited, it probably would've gone over $43k, so I guess it was a good purchase.  This Rav4 is a replacement for our aging 2007 BMW 530xi Wagon with now over 210k miles on it.  Compared to the BMW which was $62,7k when we bought it new, the Rav4 has almost everything our BMW has, plus more technology.  Rav4 rides pretty good, it has a solid feel, not very cushy but it's not stiff, either. Only downside compared to the BMW is the sound insulation. Rav4 is a bit louder on freeway than the BMW.  Now the Rav4 has about 550 miles on the odometer, Gas mileage so far has been GREAT at around 32mpg combined as we drive it on freeway a lot more than in the city. The engine sounds quite entertaining(funny), that's probably because we aren't used to hear a 4 cylinder engine sound for 14+ years.  Cargo capacity is great, LED headlights and LED fog lamps are very bright.  We are still learning how new safety technologies work and how to use some stuff. For only a bit over $40k, it has everything we needed in a car, it's a pretty good purchase. We are very happy that we could save quite a bit ($20k to $30k) by switching to Toyota from BMW."
"04 12, 2021","Great SUV, space for my grandkids","This SUV is what I was looking for. It has room for my grandkids. It drives 
really nice. It has a lot of features. I love my sunroof."
"04 11, 2021",Excelente,Es lo máximo todo muy confortable excelente a/c las luces me encanta todo en sentido general muy cómodo los asientos las luces led me encantan
"04  9, 2021","Brand new model for us, so far it's great","We have driven only Toyota's for last 30yrs & all have been  economical, durable and fun to drive. I drove (& still am) driving my 2000 Camry. It was bought 2nd hand 20 yrs ago & has been coast to coast. I'm sure this Rav will too."
"03 31, 2021",BEST RELIABLE CAR EVER,"This car has all of my needs, the special features are unbelievable  & the drive is so smooth. This cat is sexy & comfortable to drive. The gas mileage is out of this world & the trunk has a lot of extra space."
"03 29, 2021",Very nice car,"I love our RAV4. We decided against the hybrid, but they seemed nice too. About the only negative thing I could say about it is that the engine is a bit loud at higher RPM’s, but nothing too crazy. It’s very comfortable and gets good mileage. I anticipate keeping this vehicle for a good 200,000 miles or more."
"03 29, 2021",My forever vehicle,Looking for a smaller vehicle but a suv. Toyota’s r dependable. My husband wanted me to get a Toyota as they will last for a long time.
"03 29, 2021",GOOD CHOICE,"THIS SUV FOLLOWED 8 YEARS DRIVING A QUALITY SEDAN. I LIKED THE HIGHER BODY, INCLUDING SEATING,  THE QUIET AND COMFORTABLE RIDE, ITS RESPOSIVENESS AS A VEHICLE. HAVEN'T DRIVEN IT LONG ENOUGH TO  JUDGE IT FURTHER YET."
"03 28, 2021",First Car I’ve Ever Owned,After doing extensive research and loving the sporty look I knew the RAV4 XLE was one of my top options going into the dealership. Drives great and highly recommend to anyone considering it!
"03 28, 2021",Muy complacido.,"Excelente SUV, cumple con mis expectativas. confort, buen manejo, buen  rendimiento por millas  excelente tecnología, estabilidad, elegante figura, buen power, seguridad. Por  lo que puedo afirmar y recomendar como  un  excelente SUV."

"03 25, 2021",Very comfortable ride.,"The RAV4 is a perfect fit for me. Easy to drive, very comfortable and economic.  I would recommend this vehicle to my family and friends."
"03 24, 2021",Exceeded my expectations,"More than I hoped for! Still trying to figure out all of the electronics, but it's just a matter of finding the time. Totally love it!"
"03 21, 2021",Just bought it. Love it so far!,I love the look inside and outside of the vehicle. Runs great so far. Look forward to  driving it this summer! Love the new sunroof!
"03 21, 2021",Love this car,This car has everything I need.  I am more concerned about safety features than style but my Rav4 XLE has it all.  I am so happy with it.
"03 17, 2021",2021 RAV4 awd,"I had a 2007 Toyota Camry. Had it from new to 2021. No problem. Just regular brake, tires, oil change, etc. I want a suv now. I like reading and look at cars on internet. I look at a hundred reviews of all cars that are in same class and size as the RAV4 . It all came back to Toyota and rav4.  Some reviews were ok and some were great. But with last Toyota Camry experience. I am sticking to what is good and works. And I picked the RAV4.  I did not pick the Toyota Camry. Because it is two inchs lower to ground than my last Camry. Even   though the Camry has awd option."
"03 13, 2021",LOVE the RAV4!,"This is my 2nd RAV4. I love the size, reliability, and look.  Drives great is winter weather.  Our Great Dane mix fits perfectly inside too!   :)"
"03 12, 2021",I love RAV4 because it is always reliable,"It meets all my needs.comfortable,spacious,all wheel drive and best mid size SUV. Fun to drive.good on mileage and good for long drives.Very nice exterior.So lucky to have this car."
"03 11, 2021",Car I own,"This vehicle is more than I thought. The suv is very spacious, has the bells and whistles of a luxury vehicle for the price the comman person could afford. I don’t know why I waited so long. As Leman Toyota is a dealership that will meet all of your needs and wants. You don’t get this experience at the big city dealers."
"03 10, 2021",Best car I have bought,The comfort is great for a smaller car I am a big guy .alot of leg room smooth ride by far the best car I have purchased.
"03 10, 2021",Happy with purchase,I am so far happy with my new car. I am excited about the newer technology and the way it drives. Very pleased to drive a new vehicle.
"03  5, 2021",NEW RAV4 2021  XLE,"So far so good! Still learning the Navigation system- Only had it 4 days!! :)
Love the SUNROOF/MOON-ROOF! Never had one!
Has good engine pickup for being a 2.5L."
"03  5, 2021",Best Rav 4 Ever,I’ve always on a RAV4 I was ready for a new RAV4 is met all my knees my colors my style my everything Would recommend to anybody and will recommend to my friends

"03  2, 2021",Great car,Chuck the sales guy was great ... great experience great great great. Would see chuck again fir sure . No doubt it was a great purchase

"03  1, 2021",Coolest Car I've Owned.,"This vehicle's exterior and interior design are stunning. I love the sky silver metallic look of the Rav4. Adjusting the seat on the driver is easy and fun. The car is SUV and higher than a sedan, which works out perfectly for me. I was concerned at first that it would be too small, but you can fold the back seat to make rooms for storage."
"03  1, 2021","Bello mi carro, I love this","Me encanta mi nuevo Carro,  nada como el olor a new car , el color super espectacular, gracias a los trabajadores en especial a la señora Mary Correa por ayudarme en todo el proceso."
"02 25, 2021",Not as many features as my Chevy Silverado,It drives very well in the snow and is roomy. It doesn't have the pick up I'm used to that was in my Chevy Silverado.
"02 25, 2021",It is a fun easy car to drive,This is our 5th RAV4. We like them. They work for us & have grandkids car seats buckled in the back seat. Easy to drive!
"02 24, 2021",Great purchase!,"I love the style of the vehicle, color, has all the bells and whistles I need, along with great gas mileage.    I purchased the Rav4 Adventure and love the look inside and out."
"02 21, 2021",LE feels stripped for such an expensive vehicle,"Seat belt alarm is ridiculous. Toyota must think we're all children. Have to go back to dealer to disable it. Interior should be better. Everything feels cheap and not well designed. TIre valves not long enough. Under hood latch is cheap. Interior lights not bright enough. Horn needs to be louder. Should be able to dim Infotainment screen. I was expecting more for a $30,000 vehicle. Thin hard plastic steering wheel should have told me all I needed to know. It better be a trouble free vehicle. After 26+ years, it should be better!"
"02 19, 2021",DEFINITELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH,This was by far the best car purchase I have ever made! Very satisfied!! Feels like driving on clouds. Do not have to tank up so frequently.
"02 17, 2021",Love my vehicle,"Love how this car meets all of my needs. Very spacious and love all of the bells and whistles. I especially love the heated steering wheel, especially in the wintertime."
"02  7, 2021",This is a good car for us I always use Toyota cars,This car meets all my needs it is why I asked for to Yury Vazquez and it’s what I get from him. I’m very happy with the experience and the only thing is the interior 💺 that after all yesterday I tell my husband that I forget about the vynel seats because it’s more protection for the seats.But anyway I’m very happy with my car 🚗.
"02  7, 2021",Good car for me and my family.,"I like it.My kids like it.We are happy with the car,good to go. I like outside and inside the only thing was that I like the vinyl seats but for now one is ok ✅ we can handle it."
"02  7, 2021",Great Vehicle,"This is the 2nd RAV4 I've owned.  I really like the improvements they've made from the 2016 to the 2021 models.  It's fun to drive, handles well under all road conditions and gets great gas mileage."
"02  6, 2021",Most comfortable car  I ever owed,"Feel very safe. Beautiful interior and exterior, useful  equipment. Low gas usage. 
I will definitely recommend my family and friends RAV4 2021.  Most comfortable car I ever had a chance to drive."
"02  1, 2021",I love it,It’s got tons of room. The design is beautiful. I love the color Luna rock. It’s a great family car. I love that the seat can boot up.
"01 28, 2021",Great car,Very nice car. Good value. Nice options. Great color.  Comfortable. Good runnner. Just what I had hoped for in a new car.  Affordable luxury transportation.
"01 23, 2021",The car  met all my needs.,"Love the gas mileage  on it. And the car is very comforter ,space,and elegant.  Love that it connect  my phone using the bluetooth  not a Aux cord."
"01 23, 2021",This is my First Rav 4,Needs more horse power.  The ride is a little more bumpy going over holes in the road than expected.  Passenger seat does not go back far enough for tall people
"01 11, 2021",I love my new car,This car was what I wanted. It has all the positive aspects  of a safe and reliable  vehicle. Well designed and very comfortable.  I am very happy.
"01 11, 2021",Living my new Toyota,This Suv met my needs with a nice body style. Also has upgraded technology from a lot of usb ports and new computer monitor with apple play. It has a smooth drive and leg room for the family
"01  8, 2021",even better than my 2018!,This 2021 was very similar to my 2018 but a few extra standard features like power driver seat. unfortunately does not have front and rear bumper alerts
"01  4, 2021",This is our 3rd Toyota and the only kind we’ll own,"This is my forever vehicle, I love how it rides, plenty of room especially the back seat, it fits 2 car seats and still room for a person to sit. Drives and handles great, a big bonus was the weather tech floor mats!"
"01  4, 2021",Nice to get a new Rav4,"It meets our need for a new car at an affordable price. Some newer technology but not overload.  Does not have CD player or power seats and doors which I will miss. Seats are comfortable seem small but I am going from a Chrysler van to A Rav 4. We traded in a 2007 Rav 4 so we are use to the size and we also still have our van so it not a big change..  
Great gas mileage so far ,nice ride and handles well also.  Love that it has AWD , phone capabilities plus more.  Beautiful car easy to learn new technology."
"01  2, 2021",Comfortable and convenient,"The newer designs really load up on features, and keep you up on technology. The RAV4 comes in various packages depending on your needs. And you can easily get features added for the most part. The only minor issue is that the charging and data ports are still all USB-A and 2.5A. Wish they had the newer USB-C and fast-charge ports. I did get the wireless charging pad though."
"01  2, 2021",Second. Rav 4 Ihaveowned.,Second Rav 4 I have owned.  Wont drive any other SUV .  Great vehicle for the money.  Lovethesafety features.  Love thenewbody style.  Love the new color.

"12 31, 2020",I was looking for an affordable yet sporty looking,This vehicle has all the blows and whistles I was looking for in an SUV.  I’ve never owned a Toyota but did my research and decided on a RAV4.  Very impressed with all the blows and whistles it comes with!!
"12 30, 2020",Most comfortable car I've ever owned.,"This vehicle is comfortable  , economical and safe. A good purchase for price. This vehicle looks very elegant , spacious and easy to navegate. This is my second rav4."
"12 29, 2020",A perfect size.,"It meets the needs for us being retired. Easy to drive, enter and exit the vehicle. Automatic hatch is great. Dual air and heat is terrific. The backseat is very good to ride in."
"12 27, 2020",First new car I've owned,"Easy to drive and being a Limited, has lots of sensors making for a safer drive. Love driving this car. The only criticism is how far I have to duck my head to get into the seat."
"12  4, 2020",Best car I've owned so far,The vehicle is a great car it has all the amenities i need in a car and the gas on it is great looks sporty and classy and a great vehicle all around
"12  3, 2020",Compré la RAV4 2021,"Compré la RAV4 2021 XLE. La guagua cubre mi necesidad de un vehículo espacioso, alto y moderno. Tiene buen rendimiento de gasolina y te da seguridad. Recomendada"
"12  3, 2020",Best vehicle,This is my second Rav4 and I Love it! It's just the right size and the price is great. They made the process stress free! Thank you!
"11 30, 2020",The car is nice.,It is good.  A little sluggish.  Transmission could be smoother.  Covers everything I was looking for.  The door arm rest could use more padding.  Cenre re console is a little tight on the right leg.
"11 29, 2020",Great gas mileage,"The RAV4 is great on gas mileage. I am use to driving something bigger, so it is an adjustment for me. It is roomy & the technology is taking some getting used to. Overall, it is a great vehicle."

"11  8, 2020",A cut above,"Totally surprised me as to the amenities and functions, while providing a spacious and comfortable ride, totally worth a serious look to see if it fits your needs."
"11  2, 2020","Very reliable. Love all the safety features,",This car meets all of my needs. Love the body style and how roomy it is. Love all of the safety features that are standard on this vehicle.
"11  1, 2020",Love it!,"It's just the right car for me.. Fun, sporty, comfy! It makes me want to roadtrip! And it gets great mileage so I'll be Roadtripping for sure!"
"10 29, 2020",This car has everything!,"This car has so many features. Love the heated seats and steering wheel,
automatic lift/closure of back door, just everything! It is large enough to haul things and yet small enough t maneuver and park."
"10 21, 2020",This is my fourth Rav 4 (7th Toyota) in a row,"The car fits my needs in terms of comfort and performance.  My dogs fit comfortably, I never worry about mechanical issues, it is beautiful, a joy to drive, and I love all the “bells and whistles”!  7 Toyota cars in a row with NEVER an issue or complaint.  I am proud to be a Toyota owner.
The color lunar rock is spectacular.  The sound system amazing and heated steering wheel a blessing!"
"10 20, 2020",I LOVE my new vehicle!,"I love my Rav4! It has so many features and drives so well. It's a dream on the highway and in city driving. And, the sound system is perfect as I love music!"
"10  6, 2020",Very reliable car.,This car is just perfect for driving to and from work. It is very comfortable. I love the all the new  upgrade that was done for the 2021 make. I love the color of the vehicle too.
"10 16, 2023",Hard to beat,"Drove this '22 Rav4 throughout the US SW for over 3000 miles in 2 weeks without any problems and averaged 30+ mpg.
Went through CO, UT, NV, CA, AZ, NM. Pleasant to drive and certainly comfortable enough. I have no complaints at the moment, and it doesn't have the CVT!"
"10  8, 2023",A two Toyota RAV4 family.,2022 Toyota RAV4 LE. I purchased this SUV new in 2022. It is the second RAV4 in our family of two. My wife purchased her 2018 RAV4 Hybrid limited new in 2018. She has depended on and enjoyed her SUV for 4 years now. Her experience influenced my decisions to buy a Toyota RAV4.
"08 13, 2023",Rav4 XLE are problematic.,I purchased this Rav4 XLE last October and have had continuous problems with the a/c system. The evaporator in the front of the car is extremely poor quality and very fragile. The least little bit of road debris will puncture it. Toyota will not cover this weak design in their warranty and are very rude when approached with dealing with the issue. I’m selling this vehicle as soon as I get it repaired!
"05  9, 2023",2022 Toyota RAV4 XLE - Serra Toyota Birmingham,"My family has always been devoted and loyal Toyota owners for years. My dad had a Celica and a Corolla. My Aunt had three Camrys back to back 1999 LE Gold Edition, 2004 XLE , 2007 XLE and her daughter my cousin had Camrys as well and a black Camry Solara SLE V6. My sister today has a Corolla and so does my cousin. My Uncle has an Avalon. Toyota loyalty runs deep in our family. They have never let us down.

The RAV4 is no exception from the Camrys and the Corollas. We had a 21 Camry LE that we bought new and eventually upgraded to the 22 RAV4 XLE. Loved the Camry also.

The quality, reliability, resale value, and value you get of a Toyota is unbeatable! You just cannot go wrong with buying any Toyota."
"02 17, 2023",Quality and comfort is lacking,"I am 6’4” tall. This car is not made for tall people. The center console is wider at the top and the trim is shaped in a way that it digs into the side of my knee. The bolsters on the seat are too hard and they dig into my hips. This is not a comfortable car for larger people. In the 15 minute test drive I didn’t notice these issues. Now that I drive it every day they have become painfully obvious. The acceleration is not as good as the 2018 I had even though there is a more horsepower. The ride is slightly better. The climate control is note very good. It acts like it reads the outside temperature and not the inside. I got into the car on a sunny day and it was hot in the car. The ac would not work because it was only 67 outside. Also, the ac has a high pitch whistle when it is running. I miss my 2018. I think it was a much better vehicle."
"02 13, 2023",Great overall vehicle,"Not outstanding in any single category other than reliability, but rock solid overall.  It's a rides nice, has a functional interior, looks good, and performs well. Certainly no negatives. The gas mileage has been 30+ overall and 35+ on the highway if driven at the typical speed limits. The only annoying feature is the auto engine off that has to be manually turned off with every start."
"09 14, 2022",Great car and great dealer.,"This is my 4th RAV4 from Heritage Toyota in Catonsville, MD. I love the car(s) and the dealer. The RAV4 is the most reliable car I've ever had"
"09  9, 2022",The RAV4,Slightly noisy engine. Leather seats not first quality. Finnish needs to be updated. Pretty spacious for the value. Gas guzzler in town with AC. Should be more compliant.

"07 11, 2022",2 Toyotas & Counting!,"I have owned 2 Toyotas but my family has owned many many more. My first Toyota was a 2021 Camry. Beautiful and well equipped car.

My family and I needed something that sat higher up off the ground because my 86 year old grandmother has issues getting in and out of cars, as does my 62 year old mother. The RAV4 was the best choice. But I will recommend a Toyota to anyone. Great cars!"
"04  2, 2022",Good Purchase,"This is the first SUV I have ever owned. It is easy to handle after transitioning from a sudan. The safety features, sunroof, and Apple Carplay are my top favorites.

"01  9, 2024",Radio turns 2023 Rav4 to a DO NOT BUY,"Comparing our old 2022 Rav4 against our new 2023. Wish we kept the 2022. The 2022 was more comfortable.  The driver seat on the 2023 feels like there is a bundle of fabric on the rear of the seat. 

The radio of the 2023 is a piece of junk. It is enough to NOT buy the car. That bad. Loses sync with the phone. Radio goes to mute after phone call and requires car to be shut off the reset. Hard to see what channel the radio is on. Many more problems.

Bottom line is if you don't listen to your radio the 2023 Rav4 is fine...if not DO NOT BUY"
"01  3, 2024",Make sure you love this before purchasing.,"Yes but realize the seats are not comfortable for long road trips and the front seats are at least one - 1.5 inches shorter than most other cars. The radio is beyond difficult to operate and once ONE phone is paired with the car - other phones cannot be paired, and finding simple radio stations is excruciating painful.  Zero logic.  Also this auto shows time on the center console and the only temperature reading is on the drivers speedometer screen. And the front door handles are located on the front of the interior door so if you have a purse or child or package in one hand - finding the handle to close the door is awkward, heavy and not functional. Overall not a bad car but for the price - I would have thought Toyota could have done a much better job."
"11  6, 2023",CarPlay and Toyota Drive Connect Issue,"I recently purchased a 2023 RAV4 Hybrid and love the car in general.  That said, I have one major complaint.  Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I was using my iPhone connected to the Multi-media screen through CarPlay, when the iPhone maps app disappeared and I got a splash screen saying “Experience Toyota Drive Connect.”  There was no way to exit this screen apart from pulling over and restarting the car and reconnecting the iPhone.  I googled this issue and saw various possible solutions, but none worked.  I called Toyota and after multiple delays, was told that the only way to get rid of this screen is to purchase a subscription to “Go Anywhere” which includes Drive Connect and Remote Connect.  The cost is $15 per month, plus whatever tax you pay in your locale.  While Go Anywhere has some nice features, it should be an option, not a mandated purchase to utilize CarPlay.  It seems to me that this is essentially extortion, forcing owners to purchase a subscription in order to use CarPlay.  This is beneath the high standards of Toyota.  I’m sure that Toyota could disable this splashscreen easily should they so desire."
"10 20, 2023",Great service,Went to the dealership for my first service. Dawn Thomas was my advisor. She did a fantastic job of explaining the process and what to expect in the future. Thanks Dawn
"08 15, 2023",Love my Rav4,I love my Rav4.  It's not only fun to drive but is a sharp looking vehicle.  It has plenty of room for passengers as well as our 2 dogs.
"07 19, 2023",Great car with only a few minor shortcomings,"Beautiful, well running car. Excellent mileage, quiet, with comfortable ride. Lots of advanced safety features. I miss the CD player, and radio is too complicated—user friendliness could be better."
"05 15, 2023",Interior scratches super easy,The interior scratches VERY easily. A complete waste of money. I have had cheaper cars in the past that were almost impossible to scratch on the inside. I’ve only owned mine for a week and I am seriously considering trading it in. If I wanted a car that you had to be super gentle with I would’ve purchased a luxury vehicle.
"05  8, 2023",New Navigation System takes getting used to,"Traded a 2016 RAV 4 Hybrid Limited for gas 2023 RAV 4 XLE.  It was a pain to get navigation system working w Apple car play.  I like the old navigation map better, it showed more infor on highway exits.  The SOS emergency call button service is something I now have.  Don’t care for engine down cycle at stops but can switch it off.  Gas mpg is 25 not 28 which is pretty good.  Must push harder to close door.  So overall I like the new RAV 4.  Would have kept the Hybrid but getting close to the last year the big batteries under warranty."
"05  7, 2023",Completely Satisfied,Traded my 2018 RAV4 XLE for 2023 RAV4 Premium the difference is day&night smooth ride more quiet a lot of performance cruise control works a lot better so far completely satisfied
"04 13, 2023",Rav4 2023,"Just love it.Great gas mileage,comfort,style.I would recommend this vehicle.Rav4 was a great choice.Test drove most suvs and drove this once and ordered that day.Clearwater Toyota the best."
"03 18, 2023",STOP THE SWAY,Car sways and pulls back harshly even though i turn off sway. Taking in AGAIN on Tuesday. Had 2020 Rav 4 no problems. There is really something wrong. Only 1200 miles.
"03 15, 2023",Love my RAVA,The most luxurious and elegant vehicle I have ever purchased. This car is state of art in so many way. Really outstanding Toyota with all the bells and whistles.
"03 10, 2023",Attractive styling and good value,"I purchased this vehicle one month ago after having a Lexus RX350 for 5 years. Although I bought the Limited package, there are a few options that aren't available that I was used to having in the Lexus, specifically the feature of the seats and steering wheel automatically going to the preset position when entering the car. The driver's seat area is somewhat small due to the car being small. The ride is fine and road/engine noise is not terrible considering it has a 4 cylinder engine. I purchased the vehicle due to Toyota's reputation for reliability but, with only 800 miles on the vehicle, I cannot accurately rate reliability."
"01 19, 2023",rav4 not as good as it looks,This vehicle performs poorly. When you are merging from a side road into the highway you better make sure that there are no cars coming because when you hit the gas to accelerate the Toyota rav4 does not respond. It makes a lot of noise but no power. ( Very dangerous) Also the engine is very noisy. It sounds like a lawn mower.  In addition the glove compartment is very small. Once I put the vehicle manuals inside the glove compartment I could hardly fit my proof of insurance and the vehicle registration. Also you have to slam the doors otherwise they don't close properly. I am not happy with my rav4 performance. Will not recommend it.
"01 18, 2023",My Rava 4,"My purchase was exciting ,Drove and the Ride was just what I expected ! The salesman was great  explained all the features  ! I love the car and performance Toyota was a good place to do business with"
"01 18, 2023",My little Rav 4,"I have only had my Suv for about a month, but I love it! Two things I wish I had gotten but didn’t— the automatic adjustable seats and power lift! Lots of room! Took on trip to beach and got great gas mileage! Runs great!"
"01  9, 2024",Radio turns 2023 Rav4 to a DO NOT BUY,"Comparing our old 2022 Rav4 against our new 2023. Wish we kept the 2022. The 2022 was more comfortable.  The driver seat on the 2023 feels like there is a bundle of fabric on the rear of the seat. 

The radio of the 2023 is a piece of junk. It is enough to NOT buy the car. That bad. Loses sync with the phone. Radio goes to mute after phone call and requires car to be shut off the reset. Hard to see what channel the radio is on. Many more problems.

Bottom line is if you don't listen to your radio the 2023 Rav4 is fine...if not DO NOT BUY"
"01  3, 2024",Make sure you love this before purchasing.,"Yes but realize the seats are not comfortable for long road trips and the front seats are at least one - 1.5 inches shorter than most other cars. The radio is beyond difficult to operate and once ONE phone is paired with the car - other phones cannot be paired, and finding simple radio stations is excruciating painful.  Zero logic.  Also this auto shows time on the center console and the only temperature reading is on the drivers speedometer screen. And the front door handles are located on the front of the interior door so if you have a purse or child or package in one hand - finding the handle to close the door is awkward, heavy and not functional. Overall not a bad car but for the price - I would have thought Toyota could have done a much better job."
"11  6, 2023",CarPlay and Toyota Drive Connect Issue,"I recently purchased a 2023 RAV4 Hybrid and love the car in general.  That said, I have one major complaint.  Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I was using my iPhone connected to the Multi-media screen through CarPlay, when the iPhone maps app disappeared and I got a splash screen saying “Experience Toyota Drive Connect.”  There was no way to exit this screen apart from pulling over and restarting the car and reconnecting the iPhone.  I googled this issue and saw various possible solutions, but none worked.  I called Toyota and after multiple delays, was told that the only way to get rid of this screen is to purchase a subscription to “Go Anywhere” which includes Drive Connect and Remote Connect.  The cost is $15 per month, plus whatever tax you pay in your locale.  While Go Anywhere has some nice features, it should be an option, not a mandated purchase to utilize CarPlay.  It seems to me that this is essentially extortion, forcing owners to purchase a subscription in order to use CarPlay.  This is beneath the high standards of Toyota.

When you are merging from a side road into the highway you better make sure that there are no cars coming because when you hit the gas to accelerate the Toyota rav4 does not respond. It makes a lot of noise but no power. ( Very dangerous) Also the engine is very noisy. It sounds like a lawn mower.  In addition the glove compartment is very small. Once I put the vehicle manuals inside the glove compartment I could hardly fit my proof of insurance and the vehicle registration. Also you have to slam the doors otherwise they don't close properly. I am not happy with my rav4 performance. Will not recommend it.

2023-01-20 00:00:00,,"I bought this car as my first and it never broke down in 13 years. Worked flawlessly. I'm actually shocked, it rarely needed maintenance. It's a beast of a vehicle. I'm finally getting a new car only because I need to get a 4WD/AWD for the snow, but if you don't need that, it's a gem."
2022-09-22 00:00:00,,"Dependable, comfortable, no major mechanical issues in 12 years, great pick-up, good storage, many amenities, fun to drive."
2021-05-07 00:00:00,,"For a small SUV it has a lot going for it. Lots of space in back, nice back seat and storage everywhere. Handles well and is tight. The 2.5 I4 engine has plenty of zip. I would like a little more leg room up front, I have long legs, but I am doing OK with it. It's a very solid vehicle. Very happy with my decision to go with the RAV4."
2019-08-02 00:00:00,,"Front left&right ball joints replaced at 150,000 mi."
2020-03-13 00:00:00,,"This car has a recall that effectively permanently disables the rear toe alignment adjustment by coating it in epoxy.  

This results in increased wear and tear on the suspension and tires, and if you require alignment, the cost to replace both lower forward control arms which can be more that $600.  A tidy profit for Toyota and Toyota dealers.

I'd stay away from this vehicle, and from Toyota, who thinks that it's an acceptable practice to pass on the costs of their engineering failures to the consumer years after the purchase."
2019-12-16 00:00:00,,"Hi Guys!

I love the RAV 4. This is the 4th 2010 model i will be driving for so many reasons. I have never driven the V6 Limited option so i decided to get one. This is putting it mildly - This RAV4 is a Fuel Drunkard! 

It does Avg of 10.9 MPG and i don't understand how this is possible. My Ford Edge 2013 Limited 3.7L V6 does 19/20MPG while my 2014 Venza V6 does 22/24MPG. 

Previous RAV4s did about 23/24 MPG and never felt the pain in my Gas Budget. Please i need help urgently. What could be the issue? Various checks have been made on the Vehicle and no issue found. 

Please HELP as i am about to go crazy. Thanks."
2018-12-04 00:00:00,,"I kept my garaged-kept Rav4 maintained religiously at Team Toyota ever since I purchased it - Oil change, tires rotate, this safety check etc  There is no sign or warnings, one morning it won't start and need to be towed to Team Toyota - diagnostic call - that it need to replace the engine - it's died.  Where is that Toyota will last  - last - last to 200K+ miles - they don't die.  NOT TRUE   quite disappointed - I have to pay $5000 to replace an old engine they found with 2 years warranty.  SAD
Yeah, update - the replaced old engine is working,  but I hesitate to drive Rav4 for a long distant.  I will continue to keep up the maintenance.  will see."
2019-04-12 00:00:00,,"Virtually no issues with this car other than a sway bar link and a heat shield clamp in 125k miles.  It's not the most comfortable car in the world, but it is practical and goes great in the snow.  The seats are not comfortable at all and if you are over 6', this vehicle isn't for you.  Other than that, no real complaints. I have a Limited model with leather and all the bells and whistles.  It doesn't look the fanciest, but everything works as should.  22-29 MPG.  Can't beat that for a 4wd vehicle."

2017-01-21 00:00:00,,"Thought I would share my experiences in case someone is looking for a nice used vehicle. I've owned my Rav since it was brand new(2010). Very reliable vehicle. Have had next to zero issues except recalls which cost nothing except a little time. The V6 engine is probably the strongest part of the car. Tremendous acceleration, smooth, and avg. 22 mpg. I'm still on my original brake pads and I'm at 50,000 miles. The cargo space is deceivingly big inside. Mine has the spare tire on the rear gate, but that is actually an advantage because it opens up a lot of underneath storage inside the cargo area. The few downsides would be that the rear seats are a little hard (but they do have plenty of room and they recline), the steering is a little numb on center, and their is torque steer if you gun it from a standstill (and I have 4wd). But the engine is so powerful there is no need to gun it. The 4wd drive is very good and includes a lock feature for really slippery conditions. Because it's a 2010 it doesn't have all the latest technology, but if you're looking for a dependable car that's fairly comfortable with a lot of room and a great engine, you'll be happy. In a few years I plan to give this car to my daughter for her first car.
UPDATE-Jan. 2019
Still loving the reliability. Ready to hand this over to my daughter with no reservations. Still on the original brake pads at 59,000 miles. These new turbo 4 cylinder engines can't touch the smoothness, the power, and reliability of this 6 cylinder engine."

Front and back were crushed but my wifi and I walked out of the accident... With minor whiplash.   We're ok.                     So, we looked for another RAV4 with the same style.  Found 2010 LIMITED V6 4WD (love the V6 power) with only 20,000 miles.  This is better because it has backup camera and smart key--love that feature.    We are going to use this car for many many miles and long long years.  Best SUV we ever had.  Btw, we had a Touareg and it's ok."

2016-10-10 00:00:00,,"With nearly 84,000 miles, I have very little trouble with this car.  The trouble is in the form of a few recalls.  I have looked at newer RAVs and still prefer my old one as Toyota has removed some convenience items such as a double glove box (the new RAV has only an opening at the top where the old second glove box was), the sunglass holder above the windshield (I like having a place to put those), and a covered middle console (it is now open).  Cutting corners like that will not necessarily make me a repeat customer if I can find another car I like as well.  If Toyota would return some of the convenience items, I for sure will be buying another RAV.  It also handles very well in snow (a big necessity in Minnesota).  My main focus when I buy a car is how comfortable the seat is for me (I am 5'2"" and the seat makes or breaks the car for me).  My RAV fits that bill and I like the fold-down seats and huge hauling capacity in the back.  My only real complaint is the noise level in the car.  There seems to be a lot of wind noise which results in my having to turn up and down the radio/CD player.  Other than that I am a huge fan of this car."
2016-09-16 00:00:00,,"I have 120,000 miles on the car, maintenance includes oil changes, tires, brakes.   What else can you ask for,  Road noise is a little loud,  comfort is ok,   This is a good vehicle."

2014-07-25 00:00:00,,"Upgraded from an Altima due to the arrival of my daughter. The V6 engine and transmission are oustanding. Interior is overall great, seats are comfortable, equipment on limited is generous. Trunk is very spacious and practical. 

I purchased it on 43000km, now at 100000km. I've had a few surprising bills on it, specifically 3 shocks, a wheel bearing and a sticking parking brake cable, as well as a loose cable to the backup camera and an occasional glitch where a random radio button doesn't work.

The ride is at best acceptable but not as smooth as I'd hoped, I put the softest tires on possible which has helped too (the Toyo a20's were not good)

This will be my one and only RAV4, the thought of downgrading to a 4Cyl from the V6 is not appealing so when this needs to be replaced I'll get something else."

2015-12-23 00:00:00,,"Classic Toyota gave us a car buying experience that we will never forget. We drove in from Kentucky to visit with family, and to buy a car for a better value. We had looked at our Capital One email who referred us to classic Toyota in Waukegan. Once at the dealer we were met by Diana Romero who was our sales and leasing associate. Diana was friendly, knowledgeable, and she offered us coffee, snacks, and just had a wonderful personality. Diana gave us back our faith in car dealerships because of previous experiences we had vowed never to go to a dealership and purchase a car. We told Diana our monthly price range and she was able to stay within a close proximity to what we wanted, and she was very honest from the beginning about what Toyota financing could offer. I will definitely refer friends and family to that specific dealership. :)"
2013-08-08 00:00:00,,4 times in the last 2 years the vehicle would not start because the brake pedal was locked and not moveable.
2013-03-13 00:00:00,,"I wanted a well rated small SUV with lower owner cost, so I recently bought a 2010 Rav4 and love how fun this car is to drive! 

PROS:
The V6 has lots of power and better gas mileage than my last car (a Mercedes C300) and I love that the Rav uses regular grade gas.
Lots of cargo space, roomy back seat, and the radio's aux is great for using Pandora on my iPhone.
Nav and back-up camera are great features!


CONS: Hands free phone system's mic is poor quality.
Braking is a little slower than I'm used to.
Cup holder insert is too small for a travel cup and without the insert, it's too big.
Not a big deal, but a little frustrating.

Overall, I LOVE this car!"
2013-03-05 00:00:00,,"After having both a 2002 and 2004 CRV,
I bought a 2007 RAV4 with the V6. It had greater usable cargo space and the V6 got 22mpg when the 2 CRV's never got over 21mpg with a 4 cyl.
The 2007 RAV4 got totaled in an accident, so since I was very happy with it, I bought another identical V6 4x4 base model. I bought it with a Toyota trailer hitch and I have no problem towing a 8x5 Big Tex trailer loaded with a John Deere 2320 tractor plus 3 Labs in the back cargo area in 3 large dog kennels every week 80 miles to a farm I own in the next county over.
The total weight of the trailer and Tractor is 2850lbs. I still get 16 mpg with that load and the power and braking are more than adequate."
2013-02-03 00:00:00,,"I brought the 2010 rav4 limited v6 awd brand new on a lease. I owned it for almost three years and have put 26,000 miles on it. The v6 engine is amazing, super fast and can pass anyone. The JBL stereo system is awesome. The bluetooth works good. The rav4 doesn't like corners and takes longer to break then most small suv's. If you open the moon roof while you are on the freeway, there is too much noise. The leather seats are not very comfortable. But other than that, great car and Toyota sells the best cars out there. I never had a problem."
2012-12-12 00:00:00,,"Pros:
handles surprisingly well with good acceleration and steering, decent gas mileage, good JBL sound system, interior foot lights are sweet, 4WD mode is great since it is superior to AWD, heated seats, very little serice work needed except re-torquing the drive shat every 15,000 miles, interior design is good especially the fold flat rear seats, lots of cargo space with easy access.
Cons:
very noisy-can't even talk on the phone due to noise level, small steering wheel, poor visability out the rear but all cars are like that now, front license plate gets damaged in car wash."
2012-11-08 00:00:00,,"I bought 2010 Rav4 base 4x4 at Carmax on my return from overseas.
I needed a reliable, roomy SUV quickly for a long road trip.
I love to drive.
Fully loaded with stuff, using a/c, 28mpg highway (despite only 4 gears, a happy surprise).
Totally reliable, lots of storage room, side swinging rear door ok, full size spare tire a godsend.
Grossly uncomfortable driving position for this 6'2"" 210lb male, no lumbar support, my knees rubbed against console and window controls.
The worst was the loud, arthritic creaking from all the RAV4's body joints on launches, turns and stops!
It sounded like a Yugo.
What's up with Toyota?
I traded it in on a used GLK."
2012-10-01 00:00:00,,"After wanting to downsize from my minivan with the additional goal of improved gas mileage, I initially test drove a pre-owned Ford Focus and it was ok but quite compact especially the second row leg room. I happened upon the RAV4 in the same lot. I really liked how spacious the leg room was in the second row and I really liked the back storage. I am 5'2"" so the cargo door is a plus because I had to be on my toes with the van hatchback.The full sized spare tire is also a plus; I read some neg reviews about its location but I think it's much easier access. My combined gas mileage is 25.4 M-F due to hwy commuting; on the weekend which is more in town it's 25.1. Overall a good value."
2012-09-28 00:00:00,,"Have had this car for 2 years now and clocked 20k miles on it. From the outside the Sport package is quite handsome and aggressive. I don't even mind the tire on the door. Then you get in and drive it. The 4 cyl/4 speed gets the job done, but there is no joy. The handling is good for a Sport Ute but can be jarring and at times uncomfortable particularly on long trips. Tight cabin for a 6' tall guy. Interior bits are cheap. There's plenty of space for your stuff which is why we purchased the car, but coming from a '04 BMW 325i this car is a little disappointing and leaves me longing for days of yore. Toyota cheaped out on this car and it shows."
2012-06-11 00:00:00,,"I have had this car for a year and a half.
Toyota is the worst company to deal with.

After 7,000 miles the brakes made a garggiling sound and would not come to a complete stop.
I have my wife and kids in the car up in the mountains on a sunday afternoon.
Called Toyota and they wanted to charge me $500.00 to tow the car to a dealership.
Towing NOT covered under bumper to bumper.

Also the tires on the car only lasted 22,000 miles.

The radio will turn its self off for no reason.

In June 2011 I was rear ended while I was at a stop and the person was going 50 MPH and the car did so well in the accident. I was very impressed how well it took the hit from the other car.
2011-07-11 00:00:00,,"We bought the 2010 Rav4 base model 4 cylinder because we owned a 2003 4runner and wanted better gas milage. the Rav4 boasted 21 to 27 miles per gallon. Yeah right! More like 21 all the time! Also the ""4 wheel drive"" isnt really 4 wheel drive. It is only active until you reach 25 mile per hour! Then it's just a two wheel drive. And did i mention the suspension? It was sooooo stiff you get beat up in the drivers set day in and day out. Over all i was very disappointed and paid wayyyy too much for this thing! it just felt so cheap! Well we traded it in this week for a 2009 Subaru Forester!"
2011-06-21 00:00:00,,"Check engine light issue, will be covered by warranty.

We've taken it on 2 very long trips and it perfoms great.
We get over 26 mpg.
Our only gripe is that the bluetooth instructions in the owner's manual are complete garbage! I've had to take it to the dealer 3 times to get the bluetooth working.
The rep at the dealership (who told me she had to ""go to school to learn how to program phones for Toyota's bluetooth technology) had major problems trying to get our phones synched up.
It took her over 40 minutes to get it working.
She also stated NOT to follow the owner's manual instructions. What should be an easy application made difficult by Toyota's good for nothing instructions."

I love how the backseat folds down so easily (I had to take the seats out in the '04), there is a lot of room in the back, and the drive itself is great- smooth and not a lot of road noise. My main complaints are the cupholders and lack of change drawer! I drive 50/50 highway/city and get ~22mpg. I wish this could be higher but I have the V6, 4 wheel drive so I guess that comes with the territory!"
2011-01-04 00:00:00,,"We are a toyota family, going back to 1966 and my dad's 67 Corona. I couldn't decide between the forester, rav4 and the honda crv. What convinced me to get my rav4 was that it was the only one with a v6. We just drove our rav4 to Palm Springs, California and back, from Tacoma. We had 4 people and at least 500 pounds of climbing gear both inside the car, and on top of the rack. We averaged around 21 to 23 miles a gallon to LA and back. The car has a ton of power, and can cruise at 80 all day, even uphill and loaded down. With nokian happelita studded tires it is a tiger in the snow. 6000 on the odometer and perfect so far. You can sleep stretched out in the back. Best car I've ever had."
2010-12-06 00:00:00,,"We bought our RAV-4 at the beginning of the year. We got the RAV when the price dropped to the same level as the Forester. The stock tires were fine the end of the first winter. I bought some Blizzak DM-V1s for this winter as the OEMs have poor ratings for winter driving. No problems with combined mileage at 27+ mpg. The vehicle rides a little rough and the steering, brakes, and accelerator are a bit sensitive."
2010-12-03 00:00:00,,"I purchased my RAV4 after looking at the Honda CRV, Acura RDX, Kia, Mazda and Hyndai small SUVs. I was previously driving a 2007 BMW X3. I was able to get an excellent price on my purchase after using Edmunds dealer quote program, sales price was even $1500 lower than average displayed. I have driven my RAV4 for 600 miles and am already averaging 23 MPG."
2010-11-14 00:00:00,,I bought this vehicle after months of researching it and other vehicles. I can't believe I never came across anyone talking about the navigation system which does not allow you to use it when the vehicle is moving! I couldn't understand why the nav would only work sometimes and then on a road trip 2 days ago I finally stopped at an out of state dealer that told me why. It is so dangerous to stop to use the navigation system! I never would have bought either the car or the car with nav already in it. I feel cheated and betrayed and likely sell this car and demand a rebate from Toyota.
2010-11-12 00:00:00,,"Best cargo space in its class, lots of useful compartments. Was skeptical of the spare on back and swinging back door - now I love those features, make the car even more practical. Leg room in the second row is impressive. Acceleration is adequate. Gas mileage great if you drive carefully and don't unnecessarily rev up the engine; on a highway when driving not more than 65mph you can easily get 30 mpg. I own mine for 2 months now, I do 50/50 city/highway mix and my average mpg is 28.2, weather and driving conditions were perfect, though - during winter and sweltering summer days I expect the average mpg drop a little, perhaps to 27 not lower. Oil change every 5K instead 3K - like it too."
2010-11-09 00:00:00,,"I couldn't be more happier with my Rav4.  At the price point of the Base Rav4, I feel I got a reliable vehicle with lots of great features for my money.  Really like the side opening rear door, full size spare tire on the back, ease and location of controls, nice radio with XM Satellite, attractive exterior and lots of cargo space.  Also, quiet motor, no road noise and a smooth ride.  I have the extra value package which was worth every penny.  My Rav4 is a blast to drive and so far is trouble free.  I'm a satisfied customer and very happy with my decision to purchase the Rav4."
2010-10-29 00:00:00,,"I bought my RAV4 7 months ago and I've never liked a car better than my new one. Ride is smooth enough and all these things I read on reviews about vibrating and stuff, never experienced it except when I'm driving on  rough roads and unpaved ones, quite expected I would think. My car is the limited model and the convenience of the features really fits me well. The only thing I don't like about my car is how much I paid for it. Gas mileage is very reasonable since I'm primarily the only passenger plus my little dog, we're so happy to go out of town occasionally on weekends with comfort. I agree it's no escalade nor a Land Rover, but it certainly fits most responsible,low profile people like me"
2010-10-22 00:00:00,,"Being upgraded from 2005 Nissan Altima (Sedan). This is my first ever new car in my life. I love my Rav4 for the roominess, comfort & great performance. Fun & Steady driving. My family loves it. I4cyl has great power in it compared to CR-V.  Had to return the Sport model, as the sport tuned suspension did not give a comfortable ride for the rear seated passengers."
2023-02-11 00:00:00,,"I bought my Rav 4 with 150000 miles on it. I had a Toyota Corolla years ago and I couldn’t kill it. It was a great car. So when I purchased the Rav 4 I was confident that it would be extremely reliable. I’ve read about the excessive oil burning of the 2.4, but this is the 2.5. It was supposed to be the improved engine. I’ve had it for a year and have put so much oil into this thing. The records show on car fax that the oil was changed regularly by a dealership from previous owner. I add a quart and a half of oil every 350 miles. No engine lights and it hasn’t left me stranded, but it is very frustrating and expensive. I’m changing spark plugs regularly as well. They get fouled up with all of the excessive blow by from oil burn. I love the way it handles in snow. It’s great for that, but my next purchase will more than likely be a Honda."

I've kept it well-maintained.   All services, including oil change, filter change, etc. are done on time.  I only have 78500 miles on it.  I've pushed it to its limits when travelling.  The only thing with this car is, it's noisy.  You're not well protected from the noisy road.  Besides that, it's been reliable and handles well in snow and rain.  I recently changed my 4 tires but that was after 5 1/2 years.  So, it is a car that I recommend.  It’s still reliable after 9 years."
2021-12-03 00:00:00,,This is a great car. I do love it!!!!
2017-09-07 00:00:00,,"We bought this car with about 85,000 miles and now it has over 170,000! It had one owner and was babied. It still runs like brand new and I have only had to pay for scheduled maintenance, new batteries, and a few minor recalls which were free of charge, 4 wheel bearings, both coil springs, and breaks. The MPG is exactly what Toyota puts out, and that's with my heavy foot. When going downhill the car will sometimes look for a lower gear, but nothing serious. The V6 engine is unbelievably amazing, it takes off fast! I absolutely love this car and it handles back roads exceptionally! When it finally dies on my family I will not hesitate to buy another!"
2021-09-01 00:00:00,,"this is a wonderful reliable vehicle, have over 136000 miles mon it and have had no issues with it, it is a solid well built vehicle and i would continue buying these type of vehicles"
2021-08-29 00:00:00,,"Toyota makes reliable cars, but nothing is perfect.  I've had to replace axles, struts, replace valve cover gaskets, and the usual wear items.  When a vehicle gets to 120k and over, you have to expect such things.  But compared to all the other smaller SUV's, these have the least problems overall.  
These Rav4's are my wife's choice, and she likes them a lot.  And believe me, I'd hear about it if she didn't.  And yes, I like them too."
2021-07-24 00:00:00,,"Purchased in December, 2020 with ~56k on it. V6 has great acceleration.  I'm averaging about 22 MPG in mixed highway and city driving. Average 24 MPG during long highway drives. Only annoyance is the rearview camera isn't working, this seems to be a problem for this model year. The wiring inside the back door needs to be repaired. Other than that, very happy with it. TONS of space inside when using the space under the rear floor.Technology3 out of 5 starsPerformance5 out of 5 starsInterior5 out of 5 starsComfort4 out of 5 starsReliability4 out of 5 starsValue5 out of 5 stars"
2021-03-24 00:00:00,,"Have about 95K miles on it. Bought in 2013 with 17K miles on it. During ownership had to change out the water pump, AC condenser and O2 sensor. Still super happy with it and would recommend."
2020-09-23 00:00:00,,"It’s an SUV w/a roof rack, trailer hitch, tinted windows. Breaks were done 6 months ago, tires are good!"
2019-11-23 00:00:00,,"This 2011 Toyota RAV4 we bought used in 2012 because a young man who bought it new lost his job and couldn't keep up the payments.  We saw the vehicle while searching online for a good used vehicle, went to see it and bought it after we drove it.  It has been the most trouble free vehicle you can imagine, second only to our 2002 RAV4 which is still running great.  Toyotas rule!"
2019-10-25 00:00:00,,"Wow...I love my Rav, even with the old style swing out rear door, its a cool factor and I have the space under the rear floor that is perfect for groceries! Very dependable and nimble around town vehicle, there's just not much to not like about it. I purchased mine used with about 52K miles from the second owner who I knew. They were purchasing a new 2017. 

It was purchased new and serviced from our local Toyota Dealer exclusively and they had all the service records from day/mile one. Over the now eight year history it has never missed a service interval. I purchased the vehicle in October 2016 (cash) and have only replaced the battery, had a break job and just put on new tires at this last service interval at 89K miles. That's it folks...nothing else has been done to it and it gets around 26 mpg consistently. At eight years old it has a few battle scars...what eight year old car doesn't have shopping cart or door dings?! 

When my friend gets ready to trade that 2017...I told him to call me!"

2018-09-09 00:00:00,,Quality is synonymous with Toyota and the RAV 4 is a prime example.  I  had no maintenance issues in the 4 years I owned the RAV4.  This vehicle had great storage space with nooks and crannies everywhere.  Especially useful was the concealed area which other vehicles use to store the spare tire.  I didn't realize how much space I was using until I moved everything to another similar sized SUV.  It didn't fit and I am still frustrated by this.  I loved the moon/sun roof.   The only negative was handling in the winter ice and turning.  I slid through several intersections and just barely avoided an accident with the median on the opposite side of the intersection.
2018-08-27 00:00:00,,Its a personal preference. Had a truck before this. Overall it's ok. Not really my style of vehicle. At the time of purchase was not really looking for what I bought. Because of mechanical and safety issues with previous vehicle was main reason for buying it.
2018-07-23 00:00:00,,"This was a wonderful little car for us that we just outgrew. It is the perfect height to get in and out, was super-reliable and easy to handle. The Limited model has many nice features, including leather seats that wore well."
2018-05-16 00:00:00,,"We have had the car in the shop several times because of the idiot lights. Have had sensors replaced and they go out for a while and then come back on, disconnected the battery. They go off for a while Nd then come back on. LocL defamer has no idea."
2018-04-30 00:00:00,,Best vehicle I ever owned and I am keeping it till the wheels fall off.  Just love this SUV.
2018-04-16 00:00:00,,"Very reliable, good fuel economy"
2018-03-25 00:00:00,,"I have driven three different cars and this one takes the cake! I got the V6 which can be a gas hog with a heavy foot in the city. The interstate gets awesome mileage! The engine shifts very smooth and steering is easy, just like butter and will impress you. I live in the Northeast where the winters can be rough and the 4WD is a dream! The car gives you a lot of confidence in snow as well. It handles well on back roads as it does on the interstate and city. If the car ever breaks down I will not switch to another car!"
2018-03-01 00:00:00,,Buy it.  I loved it and passed it on to my granddaughter.
2018-01-29 00:00:00,,"Outstanding power and acceleration.  Good mpg.  Very good features for the time.   I would absolutely by it again, especially with updated features of current model."
2016-04-30 00:00:00,,"If you're looking for a SUV that handles and drives like a sports car, this is your whip."
2017-04-18 00:00:00,,"The vehicle is very steady even in sharp turns, as it has electronic stabilization control.  This is also a very powerful, fast vehicle for an SUV!  Only drawback is gas mileage averaged 21 mpg over 39,000 miles."
2016-12-04 00:00:00,,best car you could get...money wise...safety wise....mpg wise......
2016-11-19 00:00:00,,"This has been a fantastic vehicle. Has great passing power, great visibility, and of course Toyota reliability.  My girlfriend and I purchased the Rav to replace her 2003 Ford Escape. I drive the Rav 30% of the time and after two years,  there are a few things I have found annoying.  The front seats are as comfortable as bar stools.  There isn't a lot of adjustment for the driver, and none for the passenger.  I'm 6' 1"" - even with the seat all the way back and the thigh support tilted down, I don't have enough room.  We still own the Escape and when we swap back and forth between vehicles, the lack of room and comfort for the front passengers in the Rav is evident. The driver's door and steering wheel controls are not lit.  Why are the foot wells constantly lit, but they couldn't have the window and door lock buttons lit?  We have the limited model which comes with the push button start.  With this option you can't have the stereo on unless the engine is on.  Even with these small complaints, we would purchase again."
2016-07-30 00:00:00,,Bought last week. Most expensive vehicle I have purchased. Have been sick of buying cheap cars and having in shop more than actually driving. So far love it. Not a fancy interior but functional and easy controls. Outside looks great. Brakes do grind a bit when first take off but once going stops. Live in Upstate Ny so hopefully it will cut through the snow with the 4 wheel drive. Not sure how the automatic 4 wheel drive will work but we will find out.Performance4 out of 5 stars
2016-04-20 00:00:00,,"Reliable but dated, tinny, poor material quality. Archaic instrumentation. Interior comfort is well above average."
2016-04-15 00:00:00,,"So a daughter totaled my awesome 2004 Camry XLE. (She was ok just minor concussion) I research everything even to replace a toaster oven! Decided to replace my old car with a loaded used Rav4 as my wife's car is another sedan (2009 Camry Hybrid) Bought this cream-puff Jan 2016 which oddly was traded in on a new Caddy. One owner, no accidents, well maintained etc with 22k and excellent condition. Have had it for 4 months now and it's everything I had hoped. Got a chance to drive in snow including up a steep hill and it was almost boring how well it gripped even on original OEM tires. Overall just a far smoother ride and better built than a new 2015 and 2016 I had tried. The power is more than adequate and smooth with good handling. A highway trip in heavy rain <>70 mph gave 28 mpg. Running errands in suburbia and commute yields 23-24 mpg. Not bad for what this thing can haul inside and yet still be easy to drive and park. The JBL system sounds decent with FM but awesome with CD or iPod playing. It's not an exciting vehicle to drive but it is very comfortable and pleasant. I'm surprised to read of others with squeaks/rattles as mine has none thankfully as I can't stand that. One negative is the cup holders are poorly placed but hey if that's all I have to complain about I'm a happy camper."
2016-04-12 00:00:00,,I found this car easy to drive. Very responsive.
2016-03-18 00:00:00,,I bought this car for my wife who loves SUV's and this one is no exception. I bought it 22k miles and it has served both of us very well in the past 2 years. We are now closing on 60k miles and so far we have only had to replace the Stock tires at 30k miles - which was the only bad thing we thought. Other than that we have stuck to a good 6-7k maintenance schedule and haven't had any problems with it. Some cabin noises such as squeaks and the brakes groan a bit.. but apart from that it does what it is built for. The V6 has amazing passing power and can really get off the line pretty quick. I have put the care through the paces and it hasn't let me down so far. Excellent room for moving etc. - we were able to stuff a LOT of furniture in our car and it just drove without even a slight lag. Good gas mileage for an SUV - I average 25 mpg with about 50% highway driving.
2016-03-13 00:00:00,,"I was driving at highway speed when a car ran a stop sign and stopped right in front of me.  The anti-locked brakes worked perfectly, allowing a great reduction in speed before impact.  The collapsible front end did what it was supposed to do.  The air bag deployed with no problem.  Car is totaled but I'm untouched.  I loved the car: it had great pickup, was comfortable and roomy and drove well.  I have replaced it with a 2016 RAV4 Hybrid."
2016-01-26 00:00:00,,I bought my rav 4 base model in 2012.  It's an upgraded 4wd base model with a sun roof.  It has great acceleration but am very disappointed with the gas mileage for this vehicle.  It seems to be on the low end of 22mpg and with a small gas tank seem to be at the gas station twice a week for a fill up.  What is even more depressing is the floor carpet in the interior.  On the drivers side the carpet is already torn by the left foot rest.  I never expected that for an owner who takes the best care of a vehicle.  It will cost lots of money to repair it.
2015-07-26 00:00:00,,"Here's the thing with Toyota.  It's ALWAYS been their thing.  Unless you upgrade to ""Limited"" (or in the old days LE, etc) - you get the cheapest stuff around as far as fit and finish of the interior.  Time was, under the hood all things were equal.  Not anymore.  Anyone who owns the BASE MODEL 4cyl 4WD MUST know how much of a lag there is if you need quick acceleration.  This thing is THE slowest responding dog I've ever driven.  Off the line, it's okay but if you need a passing gear, wow, it's bad.  This is directly the result of Toyota keeping selling costs down but it completely sacrifices the performance not having at least a 5 speed transmission.  I had a 2008 Corolla S before this which had better acceleration.  Thankfully, if you switch the shifter to 'sport' it downshifts more rapidly.  Traction control and safety features are great on this car.  The standard headlights are pathetic.  No fog lights standard either.  I've upgraded to better lights and also have installed foggers.  Makes a major difference.  The wheels are simply painted steel which I was fine with until three years in, they are already rusting.  Again - irritating.  OEM tires (Kumho) were also pure junk.  Finally, the stereo.  Now, I didn't expect a massive sound system but again - always with Toyota - it's not a Limited so they install something you would have found in an American car from 15 years ago.  Piece of absolute junk.  There are component speakers in the front doors and ONE WAY speakers in the back.  The sound in the rear is just terrible.  I've upgraded the rears and it made a good improvement.  A compass on the rearview mirror also would have been handy.  Don't get me wrong, I DO like this SUV.  Overall, I'm picky but those are the things for me that stick out.  It rides smooth, it's ultra reliable, it's quiet, very good in poor driving conditions, love the swinging rear door, plenty of room, AC blows SO COLD, lots of storage.  For those complaining of the cup holders, take the rubber insert out.  Simple.  Those were only there so one COULD use a can if you wanted to.  Also, like that it came standard with electronic fuel economy readings.  We have been driving Toyotas in my family since we owned a 1979 Supra.  Amazingly reliable."
2014-10-20 00:00:00,,"We just bought a used 2011 Base FWD RAV4 with 24K mi on it as we were outgrowing a 1999 Corolla with 199k miles.  This RAV4 is pretty stripped down but does have tinted glass.  The acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder and the car is quiet.  We get 24-25 MPG suburban driving, 28 mpg hwy.  Kids are comfortable in the back, and there is plenty of storage for our needs.  Visibility good."
2014-09-09 00:00:00,,"purchased a 2011 Base rav4 4 cyl with 35K,traded in a 03 Hemi Ram Quadcab,compared to the ram this is a riding lawnmower on steroids,now i can pass a gas station,the fit and finish is excellent,rides very nice for a short wheelbase vehicle,i find the 4 cyl to be very adequate for daily driving,mileage is good also,the interior is roomy,if you like the glitz and glamour look,this wont do it for you,personally,i prefer basic and reliable,banking on the toyota reliability to serve me    well for a number of years,overall very pleased."
2014-03-24 00:00:00,,"This could have been a great car, but some issues keep it from even coming close. For one, this is the loudest car I've ever owned. It rattles, creaks, and squeaks like no other. On a typical drive I'll hear rattles from the sunroof, dashboard, some random panels on the drivers side, and the cargo area. The brakes make a grinding noise every morning when I depress the pedal. Some of the noises are so loud it makes the driving experience miserable, especially for a 2011 model. If you're considering one of these, I highly suggest driving with the stereo off so you can hear for yourself. I'll likely never buy a Toyota again after this experience. I've driven 15 year old cars quieter than this."
2013-04-07 00:00:00,,"I just bought a 2011 RAV, and for me it was a no brainer. I've always had Toyota's -- so maybe I'm biased in that direction -- but the test drives convinced me.

I live in the Sierras, so I need a vehicle with high clearance. At first, I wanted a jeep, but driving two of the Liberty's was like driving a car weighed down by boulders. I couldn't believe how sluggish the Liberty was....Then I drove the RAV -- the thing took off like a rocket. It was almost too responsive -- I tapped the pedal and it would lunge forward. And the MPG is almost as good as that of my aging Corolla... 

It could be that after a while paint chips will fall off, or whatever, as others have said. But I am happy so far."
2012-12-27 00:00:00,,"Love the dealer.
Hate this ""SUV"".
I live in the northeast; I've always owned a 4WD to insure mobility in the winter months.
This vehicle does not fit that bill, in the least.
If you need a vehicle that needs to be functional and not just cute, find something else."
2012-10-20 00:00:00,,"2011 RAV4 Limited 4cyl. 4x4.

For me (6'3"") I find seat bottom short and uncomfortable. Mom (5'4"") loves the seats. Ride isn't terrible but still bounces around like SUVs do. Rides nicely on highway. One of the quieter vehicles. Visibility is pretty good. Storage and cargo space is great. 

Mom is averaging 14mpg because she drives short 3-5 mile trips to the store or doctor and frequently sits in traffic. But, it's still 3-4mpg below lowest EPA estimate. 1 highway trip 1000miles I averaged close to 30mpg.

There is no hill holder on the 4cyl. 4wd model. Car rolls back quickly and easily if stopped on incline and remove foot from brake. Very disconcerting. Only thing my mom does not like."
2012-08-10 00:00:00,,"Have a 2011 Rav 4 Limited, owned for close to 2 years now.
Have had in shop 3 times for rough start and idle.
First time they reprogrammed ECM.
Last two times no error code registered and dealer can't replicate; so nothing they can do.
Rear View camera only works intermittently.
Dealer can't fix unless malfunctioning when car is in shop.
Paint is poor quality too many chips to touchup.
Engine on occasion has raced out of control, not a floor mat issue, but Toyota doesn't know what is wrong.
Front cup holders are awful.
Traded from a 2006 Hyundai Sonota and wish I had it back."
2012-07-18 00:00:00,,"I will never gain buy a Rav 4 and I am doubting if I buy another Toyota. Bad Paint, broken rear-view mirror, pieces falling off my inside and outside my vehicle and no help from Toyota everything is a outside force they can't prove that its a factory defect. WOW Really, my car doesn't have a dent on it on the outside or inside
it still smells new and just think my car just made a year old in June 2012 can't wait for another two years to see what else falls off. I have always stood up and preferred Toyota vehicles over any other brand but it seems to only be their older models. It doesn't matter how long the car runs if it has fallen apart before you can put the miles on it is worthleless"
2012-07-03 00:00:00,,"In April 2012 I bought a Toyota Rav 4 2011.
It is July 3 2012 and already there is a penny size paint chip that came off the hood.
The dealer will not even report it let alone have it fixed.
There are lots of reports of bad paint being used on Rav4s for years.
And Toyota ignores it."
2012-06-03 00:00:00,,"I bought this RAV4 for Toyota quality. I wanted a quality, V6 , 4x4 small SUV. Overall, I am satisfied so far. (I just got the base model-keep in mind). 
Acceleration and power is great. Ride could be better, but not bad. Terrible air vibrations when driving with rear windows down (my Liberty did same thing?) Overall interior and exterior functionality is really good. Except...Toyota, this SUV needs a flip-up rear hatch! V6 engine is a little loud for a new Toyota...could be the upgraded alternator. Gas mileage is good...24.2 mpg average...about 28 hwy driving conservatively. Hopefully will increase with synth. oil next month. Overall...7 out of 10 stars so far."
2012-03-14 00:00:00,,"15K mile Update - Well the tapping noise is gone but honeymoon is over. I still like the RAV4, but now all the little things are starting to poke their heads out. - It definitely rides more like a truck now than when I bought it, with the suspension sending me jarring messages over all but the best of roads. - There are also little rattles and squeaks coming from the riser by my head between the driver and passenger door. - The driver's side window rattles a little (just a tiny amount but it's definitely noticeable to me) - The noise from the rear when doing 25mph or less is horrible. It sounds like a squeaky/rattleing cage. I've looked at all the seals, made sure everything was tightened and nothing helps. - Gas mileage has been stagnant...still 18-20 city and 22 - 25 highway. Other than that, it does what I need it to do (hauling kids to sports, school activies, shopping runs, etc.) so I won't complain too much. My next vehicle will probably not be another RAV4 but I wouldn't downplay it if someone told me they were considering buying one."
2012-03-09 00:00:00,,"being my first new car I should think I'd love it, or at least like it, but I hate this thing.
It is too cramped feeling inside, the cup holders are ridiculously worthless and out of reach, it's such a stripped down model I can't believe I paid what I did for this.
I have always driven luxury-level cars which seem to be a thing of the past, but this is bottom of the barrell in my view and I can't wait until I can get rid of it.

this will not be good when I go on cross-country trips and won't be able to have a cup of ice water or tea close at hand"
2012-02-25 00:00:00,,"After six weeks with my new RAV4, I remain impressed.
The car is comfortable, handles well, and has more than adequate pick-up.
There is plenty of room in the back seat for my three boys and the cargo area seems big for this segment.
We took the RAV4 onto the beach last week and it handled the deep Delaware sand like a champ.
I have been averaging 23.7 - 24.6 MPG around town and
 rural back roads.
During highway trips, I have averaged 26.5 - 27.3 MPG. When you have the sunroof open (even with the windows closed) the car is still fairly quiet, there is no loud resonance you sometime get in cars equipped with sunroofs. By the way, I'm 6' 1"" and I have plenty of room in the front seat."
2012-01-30 00:00:00,,"Biggest problem is poor MPG. Bought becuase of the published MPG range. Actual MPG is consistently on the low end. We live in flat Florida. Most driving is rural and occassional light city traffic. 3rd row seet is soo cramped my 6 & 9 year-olds have to sit sideways, if any-one is sitting in 2nd row. Took to dealership (Deluca) to have MPG checked. Service lady treated us like were idiots and later lied to us about how they checked to see if there was any issue (told us a mechanic drove it of 30 minutes continuously at 35mph and MPG was 28MPG). Impossible test. Wish we had bought the Durango or the CRV. Will trade this off soon! (Previoulsly loved our Corolla!)"
2011-12-29 00:00:00,,Comfortable and very good handling. I leased it at World Toyota in lakewood NJ and was impressed with the efficiency & honesty of the dealer and the price. The whole process took 2 hours. I realized later I was charged for the 1st months payment which was suppossed to be included. I emailed the sales mgr and he agreed to refund the payment without hesitation.
2024-05-12 00:00:00,,"312000 miles, body was in great shape until a deer hit it a month ago.  Burns no oil.  Insurance totalled it because of repair costs.  We bought it from them, they sent us a check for the difference and it is still very roadworthy.  Love this car."
2024-01-13 00:00:00,,Liked everything. Could fit all items going to college for the first time. Great vehicle for daughter coming home 9 hours from college
2023-11-13 00:00:00,,I had my Rav4 for 7 years and it served me so well. It holds cargo well and has plenty of handy storage spots. The V6 is fun to drive and accelerates well. If looking to buy one I would look hard at getting that engine. I think I averaged around 22 mpg with mixed driving. The only significant downside to it was the small fuel tank. The range is about 230-250 miles on a tank.
2015-09-29 00:00:00,,"Recently purchased a pre-owned  6cyl.2012  rav4  with 22,000. Noticed a low level droning starting at 40 mph. It would go away with foot off the gas. Took it back to Toyota and they said the Transmission had a bad bearing . Will put in a re-manufactured Trans. Hope that does it."
2022-11-10 00:00:00,,"Going 150,000 Miles without any major problems- just the routine oil change, tire rotations and wear and tear. I've had to replace the tires a second time after driving about 60000 miles this year. The engine runs great and with the pickup you cant tell this is 4 cylinder engine. The gas mileage I get is pretty decent at 23/mpg could be better but given that this is a bigger car than your average sedan.

One other thing to note is the JBL speakers are truly enhanced if you were to get a professional to upgrade your sound system with a radio that supports Android Auto/Apple Carplay.

This will be a hand me down once my first grader gets to High School... These Toyotas last forever! Ever heard that before?"
2022-08-24 00:00:00,,"My opinion the size is right not to big not to small, I like the ride."
2020-08-01 00:00:00,,"Mostly used for car camping and local minor hauling, not even 60,000. But if it would tow more I wouldn't consider selling it for another ten years.  Had to replace alternator but that may have been my fault. Otherwise, no issues. Reliable, gutsy, comfortable."
2021-02-28 00:00:00,,"My dad brought a 2012 rav4 limited in 2012 and it is still running good it has been 9 year, just a few problems here and there. It's v6 performance is excellent (if you buy the v6 version) and the ride is super comfortable. It can just a bit noisy when you start it. The trunk is huge and the cargo size is even more bigger. You can adjust the 2 rear seat just like the front ones. The car doesn't have that of a problem in winter thanks to its suspension and it has 16"" or 17"" alloy wheels. I hope you have enough information to be able to buy the 2012 Toyota rav4. Trust me you will be happy with your decision!"
2021-02-22 00:00:00,,"I've been driving a RAV4 for the past 9 years and I've noticed that my only problem is with the tires. I don't know if I'm alone on this one but the tires seem to develop issues with time and usage. It's the shock today, bearing tomorrow, tyroid next, just something on the tire. Apart from this, great car!"
2019-11-13 00:00:00,,"I have a 2012 Limited V6 4WD. If you have a chance to get one of these you should do it! In my opinion it's the best looking Rav4 that's been made. I could have spent the same amount on a much newer SUV with similar miles but I chose the 2012 for a few reasons. 1) the 269hp V6. This is the same V6 from the Avalon and Lexus RX350. It was the fastest car in Toyota's line-up for a time. It's a proven engine with power to spare and they stopped offering it in '13. Any small SUVs with similar power have turbo 4 cylinders that take premium gas... plus turbos break and require more maintenance. It does fine on regular oil every 5000 miles - not expensive synthetic. 2) 4WD. This was the last generation with a 4WD lock button so you can lock the differential at 50/50 front/rear power under 25mph (technically 55/45). That's why these models say 4WD and not AWD. It still has an AWD system that's always active - in most cases you won't need it BUT having the ability to lock the diff is hugely important for deep snow/mud and getting unstuck- or getting through the worst conditions. Without the lockable diff Toyota's AWD system doesn't really keep up with a Subaru or other true 4x4s. 3) Full-size spare tire. Yes, that means the tailgate swings instead of lifts... but driving slow on a tiny spare sucks! It's already saved the day twice. 4) OPTIONS! because this generation of RAV4 is getting older I was able to find one with low miles and all the options I wanted. I have a backup camera, navigation, wireless bluetooth audio/calling, leather heated seats, dual zone climate control, sunroof... great value for the money. Finally, it's a notoriously reliable car even by Toyota standards... every review you will find from Consumer Reports to KBB to Edmunds rates it super high. I've yet to have any problems and that's why you see a TON of this generation on the road. This is my second Rav4 after putting 220k on my 2000.... I'm looking forward to every mile with this one. CONS The factory speakers are terrible (unless it has the JBL system). The interior door seals can be squeaky so you need to keep them clean/lubed. The handling and steering is not very sporty compared to the sport version, subaru, or mazda. Finally, Toyota's Entune system that connects to your phone for apps doesn't work for the newest phones and they don't keep it updated... Bluetooth audio and calling works great though. I average 21 mpg which isn't the best but could be worse considering it has 269hp. Toyota interiors always lag behind in my opinion and while it's comfortable, logically done, and perfectly adequate - it still feels a bit outdated compared to other brands."
2019-10-30 00:00:00,,"I have a 2012 RAV4 Sport FWD purchased as new. The current OD reading is 69,200 miles.
My wife has a 2013 CRV base model FWD purchased as new.  The current OD reading is about 46,000 miles.  We live in Southern California.  Both myself and my wife daily trip to office is about 6 miles highway.  We have few road trips (about 1000+ miles each year).  We drive RAV4 for road trips when we need rooftop cargo for skiing, camping or fishing while drive CRV for the other types.  Our experiences are real as consumer.
Now, let me make comparison. 
Honestly, both these rival models are very good in reliability and quality.
RAV4 has better in handling and will make you feel better grip on road surface while you have a little feeling of shaking in CRV like driving a boat.

The interior of CRV make you feel better in layout setting but the seats are stiff and uncomfortable for long rang trip.
The seats of RAV4 are very comfort.  Especially, the 2nd row was design as adjustable for adding 3rd row.  You can make 2nd row large legroom or roomy cargo space.  When we went camping without set a tent, we put down 2nd row back to make a bed.  Both myself and wife fit in.  I am almost 6' tall. 
Both have good power to easily pass high Sierra Mountains. RAV4 seems have a little better acceleration at low speed.

Let us talk about fuel econ.
I have RAV4 highway MPG about 25-26 with 87 regular gas while 20 in City. The fuel tank is a little more than 12 gal.  I have to add gas about every 300 miles.

The best value of CRV is the ECO mode which make 31-32 MPG. But you don't want use ECO mode when it is heading uphill. Because it feed fuel to 3 cylinders only with ECO mode.  Therefore it has less power while ECO mode is on.  It is good gas saving design during highway cruising.  CRV has larger fuel tank and better gas econ on the road trip.  I can drive from Los Angels to San Jose with one full tank.

So far, RAV4 has one small problem.  The power window on driver side has one loos bolt and nut on driving regulator. Cost me $135 at dealership to open and tight up the nut.
CRV has problem on the passenger side airbag warning light and cost $250 to fix.

Hope these information helpful to you.
Again, RAV4 in fun to drive over CRV and comfy while CRV has better MPG."
2019-08-06 00:00:00,,"I love my rav4 2012 it’s been very good in snow, rain and heat and very cold weather I am getting a newer one yesssssss"
2019-08-06 00:00:00,,"I hated that the tire was on the outside.  After having a child with special needs (wheelchair), I've changed my viewpoint.  I needed the height of the cargo area that is offered by the 2012 RAV4 to be able to put the wheelchair in the back.  All newer models with the tire underneath do not work for our situation as they've lost at least 6 inches in height."
2019-03-21 00:00:00,,"Car has great pick up with the 6 cylinder engine. It was very easy to for me to integrate the technology with my phone and to get the navigation started. Didn’t necessarily want a moon roof, but enjoy it more than I ever thought I would."
2018-12-28 00:00:00,,"I have 2012 Rav4 with 3rd row seating.  I bought this in 2014 with still 6K warranty left on it for a very reasonable price. The Good - Reliable, dependable, easy to service, standard services. Large corgo space when thrid row is folded. Newer models do not have this size cargo space. The BAD - Seats are not suitable for 6 feet tall folks. Back and Neck hurt, now i developed full time issues. Fuel economy is not that great. Acceleration is lacking. Dealers try to sell bad OEM tires that go bad before their stated end of life, better to buy tires from Costco or Walmart. Also you can replace the in-dash CD with a Android unit from ebay."
2018-10-06 00:00:00,,"Disappointed, The electric moduler device. Went out.I had 40,000 miles on car. Had no warranty left. Electronic control module."
2018-03-06 00:00:00,,"2012 does not have backup cameras, but I never had them so don't miss them. It was a great buy and value.  So far, so good.
Many months, still a terrific car."
2018-08-31 00:00:00,,I put about 135000 miles on this vehicle in 6.5 years. It is a good ride and works fine on the highway. The 4 wheel drive however was not what I expected. It did not handle the deep (14 inch) snow drift in in my drive way this past winter. and left me stuck in several logging paths that my old Chevy Silverado 1500 would not have. I did not expect the same power from the RAV4 due to the clearance but the wheels did not lock together and the one with the least traction tended to spin.I would not buy another one with 4 wheel drive. I did like the vehicle and would recommend it for highway use.
2016-02-06 00:00:00,,I took this suv in april 2012.  this small suv is a good choice. I had a bad time deciding between this suv and the Honda crv.  I don't regret buying a Toyota rav 4 sport 4 cylinder . but I regret spending this much and getting the expensive options . the car has its issues like the slow and weak motor. it was to weak to drive in san francisco . I had trouble climbing hills and thought the car was going to slide back down the hill. the brakes have been a problem. I had them changed in august 2015 and still they make a loud rubbing noise.  the brakes  don't work very good. but I have to admit the car looks cool . it has plenty of interior space for a small suv. im averaging 19.2 miles per gallon I do more city driving then highway. most driving conditions  the car is fast enough even for the I 95 its good enough but needs big improvements in horse power. the radio sucks big time. the sound is low and terrible. the car is easy to drive in south florida and easy to park . backing out is not so good and has bad blind spots. I don't like the door opening from the side and lack of space  problems in los angeles . I couldn't open the door all the way sometimes. the sunroof makes odd noises even when closed . the interior noise is bad and loud. it takes  a while to get use to that much noise. not to comfortable on long drives because the seats are to hard. but still I recommend the rav4 because it has more pros then cons .
2017-03-25 00:00:00,,The seats are slightly less comfy then I hoped and the windshield wipers clean in a wierd pattern. But overall I love my rig. Great mileage for the cargo space and a v6 4wd. I wanted a Tahoe/suburban for my hunting and fishing rig- price stopped me from getting one. Settled for a 2012 rav 4 and actually am glad i did. - 6 months later I am even more happy with the decision. Great rig!
2017-09-13 00:00:00,,"Five years and it's still a winner. Good ride and handling. Outstanding acceleration and braking. Came with run-flat tires and I replaced them at 50,000 miles. Never had any problems or dealer issues. Would buy again except V6 is not available any longer. Only complaints are lower-than-expected gas mileage and too-small fuel tank."
2017-07-02 00:00:00,,"I loved her, but I need the more advanced help available on newer RAV."
2017-06-28 00:00:00,,"Reliable and high resale Toyota Rav4, low miles"
2016-10-26 00:00:00,,"Thought it was only fair that I write one on these since, I have read so many.  I bought my rav4 pre owned and certified. It has been a very good suv. It has surprisingly good pick up for a 4cyl. I have no problems with the family in the car passing others on the road when needed. I have had knock on wood no problems in over a year of ownership. The back seats are comfortable and recline. The front seats are comfortable as well. It is ok in the snow not a 4 wheel drive jeep but it gets the job done like most awd vehicles."
2016-09-07 00:00:00,,"We've owned this car for 3 years now. It's been a very reliable and sporty SUV. Really love to drive it!! When you need to get up and go, this SUV gets you there fast, and safely, my I add. It's got airbags all over, with traction control and anti-lock brakes that keep you safely on the road. Very fun and exiting vehicle to drive. I would recommend this SUV to anyone!"
2016-07-14 00:00:00,,"This 2012 RAV4 Base is my first SUV and I'm pleased with my choice.  I needed a fuel efficient, roomy, do-it-all car for my daily commute, driving the kids, and something my partially disabled wife could drive, too.  I put about 9,000 miles on the SUV since I bought it used in January, including a couple days of central Maryland snow.  So far, this RAV4 does everything well enough and nothing spectacularly.

Performance is adequate.  The 2.5 liter four-banger has enough power for my commute and in-town driving.  Highway merges aren't a problem as long as I'm willing to gun it hard.  The power is barely adequate with three passengers and highway merging is dicey.  My overall fuel economy is a pretty good 27 MPG.  Braking is effective.  The long pedal travel was disconcerting enough that I had the dealer re-check the brakes.  The brakes work well under all conditions once I got the feel of them.

The car holds the road suprisingly well, much better than I expected from an SUV.  The steering is predictable and solid.  The four-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and the gear changes are merely noticeable, even under hard acceleration.  I hardly notice them any more.

Front seat comfort is okay.  I'm 6'4"" and weigh about 310 pounds.  Leg room is sufficient and I have plenty of headroom, about three inches.  I wish the seat had better thigh support.  The seat cushions are very firm, almost hard.  The side bolsters hold me in place nicely, even during hard curves and corners.  All of my drive times have been shorter than an hour.  I have no information about longer trips.

The rear seat is surprisingly roomy.  Teenagers (up to 5'8"") can sit behind me and still have enough room to be comfortable.  I could sit behind me and have enough room!  The rear seat cushions are as firm as the front seat cushions.  However, my teenaged rear seat passengers ride for short trips and haven't complained.

My main interior complaint is the frikkin' noise!  A lot of engine and tire noise penetrate the cabin.  Road noise is so bad that I can't listen to the radio.  I stopped playing the radio during my commute lest my ears ring painfully at the end of the trip.

Cargo and storage is cavernous.  I love it!  I'm glad the first owner did not get the optional third row seat.  There are plenty of pockets, cubbies, and other cavities for small things.  The cavernous cargo space is a boom box, though.  I think half of the road noise is amplified back there."
2016-03-05 00:00:00,,"- The 6-cilinder RAV4 2012 has better gas mileage than the 4-cilinder RAV4 2010 (I leased a RAV4 2010 for 2 years before buying the 2012)
- It has better performance than the Cadillac Escalade
- So far it is a trouble free car, 75,000 miles
- Do not trust the dealer, check your car after picking it up from maintenance
- I had small traction trouble in the snow, probably because I used the wrong tires
- This car has excellent brakes, I HAD THE CHANCE TO PROVE IT. The RAV4 2010 4-cilinders had the worst brakes on the market.
- I gave it a 5-start rating because in average it deserves it."
2016-02-16 00:00:00,,Great around town and short trips. Very easy entry/exit due to low height and large doors. Very low maintenance costs...just normal service required. Very versitle cargo area.
2015-11-10 00:00:00,,"I have owned multiple RAV4s; and my family has purchased 6 Toyota cars/SUVS in the past nine years.  Our feeling is that the management is profiting by diluting the quality of the brand.  The 2012 RAV4 is a relatively competent vehicle, in that it handles all kinds of weather with little drama. It also has large and flexible capacities to move people and goods and very good visibility.  The platform has not evolved over a decade of changing oil prices and it remains highly inefficient at 23 miles per gallon in combined driving over 36000 miles for the 4 cylinder model.  The 4 speed transmission belongs in the stone age.  The brand dilution is most notable in some of the interior materials and the quality of the electronic interfaces.  The seat materials in the base and sport models are poor.  The seats have relatively good padding but they will stain if water is poured on them inadvertently.  Either the company did not test the materials or is profiting from the sale of Scotchguard.   The arm rests on the doors are akin to sand paper in the summer; make sure when you test drive this car you do not have on heavy coats as this flaw will become apparent in the warmer months.  Most of the interior is lower quality harder plastics, which scratch with ease.  The stereo options are uninspired.  In our case we experienced electrical problems just after the warranty expired and the dealership had little sympathy.  As mediocre as the ownership experience was for this car, it appears the newer models are even less desirable.  I look for Toyota to refocus on solid engineering platforms and the highest quality customer experience and to eschew their search for marketing gimmickry and the bottom line that keeps their cars in a constant state of recalls."
2015-11-07 00:00:00,,"Single driver, excellent condition, very low mileage, Kenwood entertainment center and rear view camera."
2014-06-13 00:00:00,,I too think the transmission feels wrong. It seems to slip and jerk more than any car I've owned before. Brakes sound as if they are dragging especially as I first drive down the driveway. The power port is inaccessible if drinks are in the drink holder. I like having a full sized tire and one which you needn't unload the storage space to access. Be sure to check the pressure in it if having low pressure readings. I dislike that you can not put longer items in to haul as I could with my old Ford that had a rear door that lifted up instead of to the side. I have yet to figure out how to put the baby anchor back in the roof compartment.
2014-05-23 00:00:00,,"I love my Rav 4.
I have had my car for just over a year and a half and have put 25,000 miles on it.
I have to drive a lot for work and this car is perfect for it.
Its very zippy and I have no problems with wind on the highway.
My gas millage is usually around 25 MPG so I get about 300 miles per tank before I decide to refuel. It is very comfortable and I have had 4 adults on a long drive with plenty of room.
The storage space is amazing! When we went to buy my husbands highlander a few months ago they asked if I wanted to upgrade my Rav 4 to the new one, but I love the style of the 2012 model and did not want to upgrade.
Great car!"
2013-06-21 00:00:00,,"Very comfortable seats in this car even on long trips.
The leg room and storage in the RAV4 is excellent.
Lots of storage and room for luggage.
The rear seats recline and move forward and backward.
I have had the car in heavy winds and it handled the windy conditions well. Interior noise is low, compared to Honda CRV. Love 4wd button.
Reliability of the Rav4 is the best.
I looked at the reviews of the competing cars and read about the problems people have for their cars.
The Rav4 had minor complaints compared to others having significant problems. after market platinum 0 deductable warranty for $950 upgrading it to a 7/100k had to shop around for the price. 12k miles owned, very happy"
2013-05-24 00:00:00,,"I've had my Rav4 for a year and took it to the dealer to have the transmission checked.
When making a low speed turn, after braking then pressing the accelerator, the automatic transmission shifts roughly. It feels like a new driver just learning to drive a manual transmission.
The dealer test drove it, identified the issue, then said that was normal and there is nothing wrong with my Rav4.
Other dislikes: hard seats, brake too close to accelerator, doors sound tinny when closed, keyless ignition locks up randomly, too many lever controls on steering column (3 with wipers, lights, and cruise control)"
2013-05-03 00:00:00,,"It's been a year now since I bought the 2012 RAV4 Limited. I do love my SUV. It has plenty of speed. I don't drag race but when I want to pass drivers driving below the speed limit, it will accelerate definitely and easily since it is a V6. I drive in town most of the time and I am getting 25.5 mpg. If I am driving in bigger cities, though rare, with lots of stop and go, the mpg will go down to 25.3. Very little difference. Most of the time it stays on 25.5. There are no hills in where I live and even the places that I go. There's less traffic as well. My ride is comfortable. My only complaint is the road noise. This RAV4 has some of it. I notice it especially when driving on interstates."
2013-03-12 00:00:00,,"We just bought a 2008 limited model (25,000 miles) with the v6 and two wheel drive and can't be happier. The car is fast and smooth. The leather seats are very comfortable. We get about 23 mpg, which is better that the 4 cylinder Accord that we had before even though that car was rated at 12/31 and this Rav4 is rated at 19/27.


We have the optional third-row seat, which is small, but great in a pinch when we have a couple more kids to take somewhere. People can't hear us well with the bluetooth cell-phone link, but it may just be the phone causing that issue, not sure yet."

2013-01-27 00:00:00,,"I have had a problem with poor gas mileage since I first bought the car.
I am not happy having to get out of a warm car to put gas in the tank so frequently.
I have brought this problem to the dealer, the service dept, the regioal rep,
(BTY was very difficult to locate) and finally to phone ""caseworker."" The best mileage I got was 18.2 MG on the toll road.
Now, in the middle of winter 14.2.
Toyota says there is nothing wrong with the car.
Their reasoning is that I must use bad gas, it's winter, it's a 6 cyl, the EPA ratings are done under ultimate conditions and I should not expect that yype of mileage
I'm dumping this gas guzzler.
I had better mileage with my2007 6cyl Camry."
2013-01-13 00:00:00,,"I'm having problems where my new RAV4 V6 4x4 just won't start up. Eventually - it will start but Toyota doesn't seem to have any handle on this issue. I notices that a couple other reviewers have had the same problem.
I'm not willing to live with this problem."
2012-12-29 00:00:00,,"Bought this 2012 Rav4 in october. I really regret the choice. should have tried to rent one first. Firstly this is totatlly a girls car. Not a real suv because it only holds 5 people and there's not much room for luggage inside. Gas Mileage sucks. Car downshifts/4000rpm on some overpasses and ALL small hills at 70-80 mph. Wind blows it all over the road. Steering is too tight and erratic. ride is rough and transmission shifts funny like it can't decide which gear to stay in at certain speeds. Cheap radio speakers, sounds really cheap. No room for mens legs knees hit on both sides while driving. Hate it, but thank God it's my wifes car."
2012-12-11 00:00:00,,"Currently have 7,000 miles on my RAV.
I particularly appreciate the power and smoothness of the V-6.
As one reviewer noted, the accelerator pedal is a bit sensitive, but you readily adjust to that.
I consider fuel economy to be pretty good--23MPG in daily driving, 30 on the highway, at least if you're not trying to pass everybody on the road.
I would think the V-6 would be a must for anyone towing or carrying heavy loads.
And it's going away on the 2013 model.
(Of course, there is always the Highlander, if you want something much bigger and more pricey.)"
2012-12-08 00:00:00,,"Okay, so it's quite early to give a full review on our new car, since we bought it new just a couple of weeks ago. I had done extensive online comparisons between the 3 of the contenders in this vehicle category: the Rav4, Honda CRV, and the Nissan Rogue. We test drove all 3, as well as a Jeep Patriot, and considered but didn't drive a Hyundai Tucson. Toyota won out on a number of counts, not the least of which was the fact that we have been Yota owners for a long time, and have had great success. Toyota was also offering some screaming incentives which tipped the scales. 
So far of course, so good, but the gas mileage to date has been a bit disappointing."
2012-12-04 00:00:00,,"I bought the 2012 V6 4x4 sport a couple of months ago. I got the sport because of the lack of the tire on the tailgate. I guess I was not paying enough attention on the test drive. This is the most bouncy jouncy bumpy car I have ever driven. every tiny bump/crack in the pavement is transferred right to your kidneys. I'm not sure if it's because of the sport suspension or the 18"" run flats. It is better on the freeway.The V6 is also a bit too powerful for this car, if such a thing can be possible. A tinny box like this should not be able to go so fast. the throttle is also super touchy which can be unpleasant if you are too heavy with your foot. The mileage is mediocre at 18 combined driving."

It didn't start yesterday morning, it didn't start today at lunch.
 After reading all the directions and trying everything, it started on the 5th try.

I contacted dealer and will be bringing it in tomorrow.

Read another review that another customer was told to ""live with it"".
 I won't.
 This needs to be fixed or should be considered a lemon.

Will update after my service appointment tomorrow !"
2012-09-24 00:00:00,,"We paid close to 35,000 with all of the upgrades.
Since the first week we owned this car it had an intermitent no start problem.
Has been back to dealer 3or4 times.
Today we were told it had something to do with steering lock--and we need to just live with it--now that we know what the problem is we know it will eventually start..
They sent a tech bulletin to toyota
and maybe someday they will do something about it.
This is an uncomfortable riding vehicle--will never buy a Toyota again."
2012-08-15 00:00:00,,I've had the car for a week. It's the most uncomfortable vehicle ever and I'm regretting the purchase. I traded my 2008 Saturn Astra for it. I needed something bigger with 4 wheel drive.
2012-08-14 00:00:00,,"I mean it - the MPG is the fly in the otherwise stellar ointment here.
I drive conservatively but with a mix that's heavy on hwy miles vs. city, I'm straining to get to 23 average.
As the MPG rating was what initially drew me to the RAV4, I'm disappointed, but I still love to get into it each day and drive.
It practically drives itself, feels like a car, and doesn't lack power with the 4-cylinder.
You'll want to go with the air deflector if you get a sunroof; I regret it and will be looking into after-market, since there's a lot of wind noise."
2012-08-11 00:00:00,,"The V6 is as quick as my V6 Altima but without the drama.
The 4x4 and traction control means I just point and go, no tire spinning.
Mileage is so so, 16-20 in town depending on how hard you push it.
At 80 on the highway 22MPG.
At 60 26MPG.

The seats are OK, nothing great.
Noise level is OK, a little louder than my Altima.

The base stereo does everything I need, I just load up a flash drive and set it to random play.

I have had the car 4 months."
2012-07-30 00:00:00,,"i bought the car april 16 and its 3 and half months later. i waited
to gather more info for my review. the car overall is good. it runs smooth on normall roads . but in pot holes and going over train tracks jesus christ i thought my teeth fillings were going to come out . the car is kinda slow even for a 4 cyclnder. 

they conned me into buying the rav 4 with no money down and my finance rate at 6.00 so they got my payments as high as $ 355.83 a month for 75 months. but i got smarter in my old age and refinanced the rav at 2.00 percent with a bank in new york. so now my payments are $ 305.25 a month ."
2012-07-30 00:00:00,,"I've owned at least 6 or 7 Toyotas.
Land Cruiser, Camry, T100, 4Runner (3), Rav4s.
The first Rav4 we bought was in late 2010: a Base Rav4 4x4 2011 model.
We love it and still own it.
We decided to trade in our Honda in on a 2012 Rav4 4x4 Limited.
What a great vehicle!
Comfort, power, all the 4x4 traction a business SUV could want.
Sure, you're not going to pull stumps.
But for an architect & real estate broker, it works great.
We can take clients out to undeveloped lots in the winter and get back out again. The Rav4 4x4 Limited also has the way cool hands-free door entry system & 1-button exterior locking.
Leather, power sunroof, bluetooth & more."
2022-10-12 00:00:00,,"Drives well, looks decent, and is trouble free. Interior comes up a bit short. The control panel is a glare magnet with a bad user interface. Some switches are mounted under the dash where you can't see them, or on the steering wheel where you constantly hit them by accident. The driver's seat tilts but does not raise and lower. It has enough leg room, though. (I'm 6'3"".) There's plenty of space in the back with the rear seats down, but there are no tie down hooks or fence behind the drivers seat to keep cargo from sliding around dangerously.
This car understeers a bit too much for good handling, but it's heavy enough to keep contact with the pavement. With all-wheel drive, it's capable in bad conditions, but don't take it off-road since there are no skid plates."
2022-08-23 00:00:00,,I bought my RAV4 in 2018 the XLE 2013 it excellent I have no complaints the vehicle is excellent it has been to California four times and back to Nevada four with same tires and just change battery 8/22/22 at Toyota dealer the best vehicle ever never any issue with it a good tracking truck I would a another the same In the future thank you MM

My RAV4 was build in Canada and Mexico. Poor craftsmanship. My biggest regret."
2020-02-07 00:00:00,,"We have a 2013 Rav 4 Limited. It is perfect size for buzzing around town and for short trips as well. Easy to maintain. Very roomy inside. We often carry lots of stuff between our two houses plus two small dogs with plenty of space for all. The only thing missing is lumbar support for the passenger. Toyota universally doesn’t put it in because “all the stress is on the driver but it would be appreciated by passengers with bad backs. Toyota has a deaf ear to that. My wife principally uses it and loves it. Would buy another. Traded it for a 2019 Lexus NX primarily because it is the same size in 2021. Happily received $19,000 in trade. During the 8 years we had the Rav, we replaced the tires, brakes and shocks. Great investment and great quality."

2018-09-15 00:00:00,,"The lighting for the flat screen display is too weak.  It is unreadable in the daytime and very weak at night. The adjustment feature makes no difference.  I applied anti-glare film which helps a bit.  The hatchback doesn’t close properly.  It goes down about six inches, beeps twice and then stops.  I have to through this routine three to four times before it closes all the way.  I have cleared the door memory per the owners manual but that didn’t solve the problem.  I have the keyless entry and ignition feature.  Do NOT lose your key chain transponder.  It cost me $471 to replace.  If you lose both units a new computer must be installed in the car and two new transponders made.  That must cost a fortune.  Read the troubleshooting chapter in the owners manual.  If the transponder battery dies or the thing gets crushed you can still start the engine and run the car.  If I were buying another car today I’d get another RAV without question."
2018-08-26 00:00:00,,"love the suv,  except for one thing.  The transmission tends to ""pause"" between gears.  I brought this problem to the attention of three dealerships, but was ""blown off"" each time.    Finally I got a letter from Toyota extending the warranry on the power train, because of problems with the torque converter on some Rav4s.  That hejped, but dealers still will not take any action without charging me for diagnostics.  With the extended warr. I am not as worried now, but would still like to have it checked before I end up stranded out in some remote place. 

UPDATE:  Sold the 2013 to an attorney.  He took it in to dealership and demanded action on transmission problem.  They tested it and confirmed what I had been  trying to tell them for over a year.   The dealer completed the work at no charge (over  $1800.00), even though warrenty was over.  It helps to be more
forceful (and have a law degree I guess. )"
2022-02-24 00:00:00,,"Bought this car (XLE with AWD) in 2016 with high miles at the time (81,000).  It now has 161,000 mi and it’s as solid, strong, reliable and comfortable as the day I bought it.  
Plenty of passenger and cargo room.  Plenty of power from the 4cyl engine, especially in Sport mode.   Great gas mileage for an SUV.   And right up there with the most comfortable seats of any car I’ve owned (I’ve owned 43 cars).  
I replaced the tires with Pirelli Cinturatos, which enhanced the ride, quiet and road performance. 
One of the very best all-around cars for daily driving I’ve owned."
2022-01-23 00:00:00,,"Listen, I love my Totoyta Rav 4 limited. It drives nice, comfortable nice features.. but I can't get past the tailgate. ITS AWFUL. I bought it used last year, everything seemed great, then my tailgate had issues opening. I got my car in December,  live in Canada, so I thought maybe it's just too cold for it to work properly. Wrong. I didn't even have it for 2 months and I was having issues and they have yet to be resolved with any resolution in sight. Took it to the dealership, they said basically all I could do was grease it up and clean it. Huh? There isn't function to turn it off but it still doesn't open properly which is really annoying. I wish there was the option for it to open just like a regular trunk. The same day I was at the dealership a lady had the same issue with her car but it wasn't even closing or opening. 
How isn't this addressed when it's the main issue with this year's make. I am not very happy about it. Anyways just something to think about. The feature is nice when it works. Which is never"

I like the ride, the style and the convenience of the RAV4 Limited crossover.  All I wanted in regards to power is to be able to hold 77 MPH on the highway with the air conditioning on and it does that. This was my first Toyota and I'm disappointed some quality issues. My moon roof started rattling the day after the warranty expired, the interior  lighting is a joke, the rear head rests block the rear view mirror and the driver side seat pinches my bottom and isn't holding up well. The keyless entry has always been erratic. Sometimes I walk up to the car and it's unlocked when I know I locked it walking away. When I took it to the dealer, it works as expected. Nice car but I'll try another brand next time. I like my wife's Hyundai 2012 Tuscon a little better."
2020-05-07 00:00:00,,"I purchased this vehicle a year ago with approximately 80k miles. I have since put on another 20k miles, just surpassing 100k overall. I have had no non-standard repair during this time. Overall, the vehicle is comfortable, with balanced drive, steering and handling. The powertrain is adequate. I am using Eco mode and achieve an impressive 27.7 MPG overall. I am very pleased with my RAV4. I have the space I need. It's comfortable and capable for nearly all situations, even traveling and it is inexpensive to drive."
2016-09-26 00:00:00,,"Just retired and was looking to replace our 2006 Toyota Rav 4 - Found this 2013 at a local dealership, called to see if still available, went over to test drive, got the ""bottom line"" price and went home to think it over.  Went back 4 days later and bought it.  The salesman was awesome, the dealership itself has some problems it needs to overcome, but generally it all went well -  After 3+ weeks we got the paperwork from the dealership & paid for the tag, etc. so we are off and running and anxious to get this our new Miss Scarlet on the road.......
Update: Miss Scarlet will be 2 years old to us come this August and our odometer reading is now 32,700, we have put about 9,800 miles on it in two years with no problems - Still loving that Rav of mine!"

2018-12-13 00:00:00,,We love this car. My favorite of all the cars we’ve owned. Great when it snows. Never had any trouble getting in or out of our half circle driveway. A bit of an uphill slope at both ends. We just bought a 2018 Rav4 & so far we love it too.
2019-05-04 00:00:00,,"This SUV meets the needs of the typical SUV driver. It was priced reasonable, is very comfortable, has great space for passengers, as well as the cargo area. It is also designed to protect the passengers. I was rear-ended at a stop light. The idiot was driving at at least 35 mph. The back end crumple zone did its job and I was uninjured. The repairs were reasonable, and parts readily available. The gas mileage is very good, and I do a lot of stop/start in- town driving. I live in south Florida and the paint job still looks new. This is also the only vehicle I've owned where I could figure out all the different controls--very straight forward. Highly recommend this SUV."
2015-04-03 00:00:00,,"We noticed a very rough ride after we purchased the car. The dealer said we could buy new tires. We declined. We feel every bump in the road. Hopefully readers have some suggestions. Our current solution is with additional outdoor cushions which we place on the front seats. This is awkward but it helps. RJM

The rough ride is a real problem. After two years I have gotten used to it. However, we take our other car, a Lexus, for any long trips

The two other problems are the poor design of the map console which is impossible to see in bright sun light  and backing where the visibility is limited and in sun light you can’t use the back camera viewed through the console"
2017-10-27 00:00:00,,"I have owned Toyotas now for going on 15 years. I had decided I would never buy anything but Toyota. I had always had great sales experiences and liked the products. Recently I got a letter in the mail that my RAV 4 may have a faulty torque converter. After reviewing the signs I quickly knew that I had been experiencing the signs of this issue and had been for some time. I took my care to the dealership as instructed. After review I was told I did have a faulty converter but also now a failing transmission. Toyota refused to take responsibility for the fact that the defective part caused damage to my transmission. I have been to two other mechanics since who tell me there is no doubt the two are related. I have the unique opportunity of being a community health nurse in my area therefore I get to be really present in my community. I often have patients and other nurses ask me about my car my experience. I actually have convinced on of my fellow nurses and one customer to purchase a RAV4. Due to this situation and Toyotas refusal to stand behind their product I plan to use every opportunity I have to let everyone I come into contact with know that choosing Toyota is a mistake. I also have several friends who are car salesman, I am going to share this experience with them so that they can let interested car buyers know that Toyota does not stand behind their products and that they are a bad choice. I had planned to purchase another Toyota for myself and one for my daughter this year as she is going away to college. I will definitely never do business with you again and will make it my mission to ensure to encourage everyone I know to do the same."
2018-07-24 00:00:00,,"This is my first Toyota. I am the original owner with about 70K miles since purchase. Had an issue with transmission shudder but recall replaced the torque converter at no charge and extended the warranty for the transmission to 150K. I have had the Toyota extended warranty to 100K with free oil and filter changes. Dealership service has been very good. As stated in the Edmunds review the vehicle is no speed demon [4 cylinder, 176 HP] however I have never found it to be lacking of power when I stand on the gas, it responds well. Interior [dash] is a bit plain but all controls are user friendly. Does not have navigation as I get better navigation from my cell phone. Fuel economy has been very good based on driving conditions. I average between 26 and 32 [city, highway] and am light on the gas when accelerating. Entry and exit is good as it sits up higher than sedans which are a problem particularly for exiting by my spouse and myself. Would like fold flat rear seats when hauling cargo, otherwise an all around good vehicle. Will consider buying another Rav4 but with all the competition in a few years the market may change considerably. With three Toyotas [two Prius and one Rav4] in our history we will likely stay with Toyota. They do need to upgrade the interior to bring a little more class and keep up with its competitors.Performance4 out of 5 stars"

2018-08-08 00:00:00,,"So, this is our main car!  We go everywhere in this thing (wife and 4 kids).  The Pros: It is a Toyota with great resale value, 0 mechanical problems than regular maintenance (oil changes, brakes and tires), comfortable interior for the entire family, LOTS of cubby hole storage hidden all over this car, handles great on sunny/rainy/snowy days (I feel very comfortable with my wife taking a drive in the snow with the kiddos in this SUV).  For the 4 cyl engine, it has a higher tow capacity than any other comparable SUV I have found.  The Cons: Not really much to say here though have two very minor things to comment on: 1) the reverse camera does not allow you to toggle for directional tracking of where your car will be with the angle of the wheels.  This is a very handy feature to have that is missing here. 2) The USB plug barely charges your phone.  As this overrides the BT function of the radio and phone, your music and such are fed through the USB, but your battery will still drain.  Leaving BT on and having my iPhone plugged in on a 2hr drive my phone lost 23% battery life instead of charging.  Road performance.  I have driven Toyota's many times in my life and am a huge fan of the Rav.  It has a peppy pickup and go from stop or while in motion.  Sometimes (especially in my town where speed limit is often 25mph) maybe a little too much pep?  I find myself taking my foot off the gas very quickly to coast and ride the brake time to time in residential areas.  The visibility for the driver can hardly be beat than with the Rav.  Very few blind spots.  A U-turn does require a little more than a standard 2 lane road with the expansion of the wheel base, but still, for the extra foot length of the car to its predecessor, I'll make the swap.  Road noise is there but not bad at all.  You feel the road without feeling like you are being beaten to death by it, lol.  A smooth ride in a vehicle that can still hug curves at decent rates without squealing tires.  Interior comfort.  My kids have plenty of leg room in the back, and if the front passenger and driver are willing to give up a very little bit of theirs, adults can be in the backseat comfortably.   The cup holders for front and back are well placed, and the seats are comfortable.  Personally i feel the front seats have a bit more padding in them for the rump than the back seats.  As I am a bigger guy and my knees don't like me squatting into and out of sedans much any more, I find the access very easy without having to climb up and in.   The back area of the car with the rear seat up is quite large for a small SUV.  My Mastiff ( a 160lb dog) fits back there comfortably.  If I need both of my dogs to go somewhere, then the seats have to be folded down.  Gas MPG is decent for an SUV with AWD.  Before we moved to the mountains we were getting approx 26 in city and 32 on highway.  Now I need to get my car tuned for the altitude as we are down to 22/28 MPG."
2018-06-05 00:00:00,,Know your needs and seek out info on the competition...
2018-03-15 00:00:00,,"I really like this vehicle. No, I think I love this vehicle. I bought this vehicle from my dad who had this before me and he loved it. He is 82 and was just ready for another vehicle. The interior is roomy, the instrumentation is easy to learn and view and the comfort of the seats is fine. Seats are not as comfy as the Volvo I just sold but are good for an SUV. Has the heated leather (or imitation) seats that are comfortable and easy to maneuver and the gas mileage is awesome, especially when you put it in Eco mode. My dad didn't know about the different settings (said he never knew they were there) due to their awkward location but I am fine with it. I don't switch modes when I am driving anyway, I keep it on Eco. At present, the tires that are on the vehicle do not ride smooth and make a humming noise but I am convinced that is due to the tires, not the vehicle. I drive 120 miles to and from work so I need comfort, economy, a good sound system and storage space for my ""stuff,"" golf clubs, foldable chair, etc. So far this vehicle is excellent for what I need. I look forward to many years in this nice ride."
2018-03-10 00:00:00,,"This is our third consecutive Toyota RAV4 since 1966.  We’ve always been very pleased with the reliability of our Toyota’s.  However, it’s time to try something different.  The extra safety features in the new RAVs are pricing us to look at the other SUVs in the marketplace. I’m annoyed that even to have push button starter will force me upgrade thousands of extra dollars making it overpriced compared to other SUVs."
2018-01-23 00:00:00,,"I have had my RAV for almost five years now and it's been a great vehicle.  Despite being the first year of the redesign, this SUV has been super reliable.  I can't recall having anything fixed or repaired during the past five years.  It's been that good!  Aside from the reliability, the gas mileage is another highlight.  I usually get 28 MPG in mixed driving, which is outstanding.  I am a fairly conservative driver, but that is still outstanding.  I love the blue interior lighting.  Also, with 56K miles, I still have the original Toyo tires, which have worn very well.  I'll probably need to get new tires at 60K miles.  I have the basic sound system, not the JBL upgrade, and the sound is excellent...good powerful bass and crisp treble.  The bluetooth and navigation work pretty well, although the nav has slow response time and sometimes misses the target location by a half mile or more!  One gripe is that the fake leather gets very warm in the heat and doesn't breathe at all, leaving me with a sweaty back!  The ride can be a little on the firm side too, especially at lower speeds on side roads.  The highway ride is reasonably smooth and quiet.  Lastly, the interior design is a bit of a mish-mash...lots of different colors and textures that don't always look like they belong together.  Overall, I've been very happy with my '13 RAV4 Limited!"
2016-10-31 00:00:00,,"I've owned a Rav4 since 2013, the redesign model year. If there's one thing you should know, it is this:               The interior cabin is filled with rattles and squeaks.                In less than three years (still under warranty as I write this), I've had no less than 4 different rattles and tapping noises to chase down. This started before 1K miles!                        The materials are very cheap Chinese plastics. I had one HUGE dash vent rattle fixed by the dealer. I'd been to the dealer a total of three times to fix the other noises and a ""catch"" in the moonroof cover to no avail. So, I've had to watch youtube videos on how to take apart the dash pieces to fix them myself.                                      After taking the dash apart, one thing is apparent: If Toyota would use slightly better grade materials and have the factory workers put another few minutes into assembling the interior, this could all be avoided.               The other thing you should know about is the Info- tainment system. Toyota Entune system is a joke and all Nav head unit functions are slow and clunky especially when compared to other auto makes from the same era. It's like Toyota was 3 years behind the others in what they offered and how smoothly it works… another obvious COST CUTTING measure.                                                                                            Other than the glaring interior quality issues and a slightly harsh ride on the 18"" Bridgestone Dueler stock tires, the motor, transmission and brakes have been fine so far.

Last words: I bought this car blindly on the history of owning 9 Toyotas before it. My mistake but who would think these guys could build such a P O S after a long history with the brand?

The suspension is extremely stiff and you will feel every bump in the road (even the ones you do not see). After a 600 mile trip to Florida, my back was in pain for 3 days. In fact I always feel pain even after an hour of driving it. It is a beautiful SUV for sure... but it is like my last marriage.... I was fooled by my ex wife's good looks, and I endured a rough and punishing several years. Today I traded it in for a used 2010 Lexus ES 350 for the exact same price I paid for the 2013 RAV4..... Night and day smoothness!! And the soft seat cradles me like a baby. Never a Toyota again."

I retired and wanted a new vehicle. Would have gone with another RAV4 if the body style had changed more over the years. The dealership (the only one in Tallahassee Florida so you know who you are) offered the bests service of any I've worked with. Really wanted to stay with them but could not find a body style I like. ""RAVen"" had 53000 miles on her and provided great reliability. Only had to have routine maintenance. Still got good gas milage and it appears to be the average (26) for vehicles in that class.

The only complaint I have is the upholstery. I bought what I thought was leather but it turns out to be Soft Tech which is a vinyl. The color is beige and stains very easily. Seats have blue jean staining and it will not come off! The dealership is no help on this issue. They ""kinda"" change the subject when I bring it up. I would buy the RAV4 again but would just go with the cloth seats unless genuine leather is offered.

2013-09-10 00:00:00,,"Bought XLE June 26 2013 and I love it!!! Have 2000 miles and get about 27 miles per gallon in city. Have not made any road trips yet. I am 5'11"" and my husband is 6'2"" and we both are quite comfortable. Vehicle has good pick up so no worries about merging onto interstate. Test drove Mazda CX5 and Honda CRV. RAV4 offered more options in the base price
and the cabin was not as noisy. Black carpet shows every speck of sand. Floor mats are a flimsy for the extra cost (nearly $300.00). Ordered an extra set online (must more cost friendly) to have on hand. ""RAVen"" (I have named her) is a real looker. Removal of ""barn"" rear door was the best thing ever!!!! 

9/14/2016 Still love ""RAVen"".  I have 45,0000 miles on her.  She still looks and runs very well.  I thought I ordered leather seats but they are not.  The synthetic fabric stains easily and things like blue jean and  ink from paper transfers are impossible to remove.  Think Toyota should offer a choice of leather or the synthetic fabric. The gas millage is not as good as when she was new. Averages about 24 miles per gallon in city and a little more (28) on highway.  Will be replacing her in January 2017, not because I have any issues, because I will be retiring and want a new vehicle. Would consider a RAV4 if the body style changes greatly.

3/15/2017 Gave car to my daughter. RAVen had approximately 53000 miles on her. She is still a great car and has had no issues other than routine maintenance.

The Sport button and other buttons hidden behind shifter so low that you had to take your eyes off the road to make adjustments. My wife and I are not large people and we felt a little clostraphobic. What pushed us over the edge was that our 2 labs had no place to move in the back seat and the last straw was the short wheelbase and Bridgestone Duellers that caused every bump to vibrate the entire car. Have to mention that the Duellers were horrible in the snow. Pluses were gas mileage and looks. I couldn't take it anymore and bought a Highlander Limited and I haven't regretted that choice. Should have done that a year prior. Nevertheless, if you like a 1 person car and don't mind kidney vibrations the RAV is a good choice.

2016-10-06 00:00:00,,"I have a 2014 Rav 4 AWD Limited. For what I payed for this SUV I was not impressed with the interior. It is cheaply done. It took me three weeks to decide if I wanted it. My last 2 vehicles were Acura, so you cannot put these two side by side. The RAV4 gas mileage in the city is about 16-17mph. I don't believe their numbers they have listed anyway. I got to really appreciate the softex interior. I always had leather but as we all know it cracks etc. this softex looks like I just drove off the lot with this SUV. This was very smart of Toyota to put this in their RAV4. I never had a problem at all with the interior. I love the RAV4 but if I had my choice I buy the Acura. Nice little truck but it's not an Acura. Just like the Lexus IS like a Rav. I owned a Lexus and they do not compare to the RAV4 even a little."
2016-08-26 00:00:00,,I purchased this based on Toyota reputation. This is my 3rd Toyota. I purchased this car for my daughter hoping it will last her for at least 10 years.

2014-06-14 00:00:00,,"I have had this vehicle since August 2013 and have had absolutely no issues with it. I was somewhat surprised at some of the reviews in this thread as I have owned many Toyotas and have never experienced a problem they could not fix. I live in Arizona and we may have smoother roads than some of the cooler weather states, but I have found the Rav4 ride to be exceptional for this vehicle class. The features available on the Limited are outstanding, everything works perfectly and I love the versatility of the transmission.

2023-05-25 00:00:00,,"Simply stated, I love my RAV4. It’s 9 years old now & practically in show room condition. I only have 67,000 miles on it. It’s barely broken in. I’m glad I opted for the Limited trim. It has a lot of nice, maybe even luxurious features. In addition to the features that were standard with the car, I’ve added remote start & blind spot monitoring & cross traffic alert. A lot of people want to buy my car. I’ve done all the service & treated it gently. Too bad for them. I want to keep this car a long time."

2022-12-13 00:00:00,,"I’m unfortunately selling this vehicle currently. However, that is due to my cost for insurance. The vehicle itself is quite simply the best vehicle I’ve ever own. Bought at 89,000km and two and half years have brought up to 144,000km. Haven’t had to take it into the shop for mechanical issues once. I would absolutely recommend this vehicle or other RAV4 models to anyone."
2017-05-19 00:00:00,,Aside from the stereo going out within the first two years this has been a great reliable SUV.
2020-09-20 00:00:00,,"This is a 6 month update to my 9/2020 review of my trusty RAV 4 LE bought new in 9/2014.  In 9/2020 I wrote that the RAV at 51,000 miles ""has been Toyota reliable except for a failed CD drive at year 4.  There is bluetooth and a USB input so all is not lost.  Still comfortable at speed on smooth interstates.""  6 months later:  The RAV seems to me to be aging rapidly.  Total miles are about 51,500 --  I've driven only 2,000 miles in the past 14 months(!)  In addition to the unrepairable CD drive mentioned in September, the keyless entry system has failed.  Second:  The car's ride is now very unsettled -- I've had shocks and etc thoroughly checked by my customary dealer.  They find nothing.  Maybe my problem is new stiff tires?  -- But I think that's at best only part of the issue.  So the ride is now UNacceptable to me on any surface.   Realignments are necessary about every 2 years if your streets are as rough as mine.  So the RAV is still reliable & trouble-free mechanically, but noise and ride are wearing me out.  Others may not care or notice such changes. Other trim levels or more recent versions of this RAV may be quite different. Please note that Toyota recently did a thorough re-do of the RAV, so current new RAV's may be much different.  I will say -- my experience with the 2014 RAV is dramatically different from my 10 years with a 2004 Camry LE which overall was an astonishingly good ""basic transportation"" vehicle. I won't have this RAV for 10 years."
2020-09-01 00:00:00,,Great car the only thing I could tell you is the steering is very light must pay attention all the time to keep car in center of the lane
2019-11-28 00:00:00,,"This is quite possibly the most reliable, most useful vehicle I have ever owned. My last three vehicles are a 2013 Mini Cooper ""S"" Hardtop, a 1996 Chrysler Concorde and a 1996 Chrysler LHS. My 2014 RAV4 kicks them all to the curb.

The MINI Cooper is too dangerous here in ""HUGE SUV-LAND, Denver Colorado"". I was cut off and forced into the end of a guard rail by an ignorant Audi driver (and ...really ...aren't all Audi drivers ignorant and arrogant?"" The driver was arrested for leaving the scene and several other charges.

THe MINI Cooper was a total loss, so I bought a 2014 AWD RAV4 with only 36,000 miles on it. A ""Certified Toyota Used Car"" which means new windshield, new tires, new engine parts where available. It was like a new car with a similar warranty. I bought it from a dealer. BEST move I have ever made. The car is a dream. There is no stopping it even in these Denver snow storms. And that 2.5 Liter 4-cylinder actually chirps the tires shifting into second on hard acceleration. Plenty of power!!

My wife has a 2012 RAV4 Limited with the 3.5L V6, and I must admit ...it is an awesome powertrain, and sad that Toyota ditched it in 2013. Witness every time we go into a Toyota dealership a salesman approaches my wife and offers her a generous price for it, since the 2012 was the last year the 3.5L was offered on the RAV4. She politely declines. Her car is paid for, and likely to go 500,000 miles or more. It has over 100,000 on it and drives nice, crisp and tight like a new car ...still! In the old days we used to look to get rid of our cars when they hit 100K. Not Toyotas. Many Tacomas and 4Runners hit a million miles. A million!! 

Toyota has the right reliability formula."
2016-04-27 00:00:00,,"My 2014 RAV4 is the best car I've ever owned.  It gives me everything I want from a vehicle of this class.
At 51,000 mi the car is still A-1."
2018-08-17 00:00:00,,"When you buy a Toyota, you expect to have it fo 200,000 miles or more, and this is well on it’s way there. Zero major repair issues (knock on wood), strong highway mileage of 30MPG, and a great riding position make this the favorite SUV ever. We’ve had a Highlander, which was also outstanding, but the RAV4 is a little bit less and and a little bit easier. Easier to park, easier on the wallet. I would buy another one tomorrow.

About three years into owning the RAV4, the only issues we’ve had are a mis-signaling tire pressure warning (minor), and the failure of the radio system (annoying!). Apparently, the radio issue is something that’s well known in the Toyota owner message boards. Replaced it with one from an electronics store for $250, and it’s better and more current than what came with the car."
2019-06-12 00:00:00,,My sister in law bought a Rav 4 And all of the lights of the dash lit up and the dealer told her it would cost more to fix it then to buy another like vehicle.  So the dealer turned off the engine lights and they were able to trade it in for a Jeep which they have had now for 5 years with no problem.  The Toyota dealer also admitted that they had similar problems with the Camry.  Toyota used to be a good car but they are over rated.
2018-06-20 00:00:00,,"My onboard radio went out of commission at the 4th year. I spent another $780 to get a new one.They said the wiring and interface of Toyota radio was too complicated to work properly. I never drove a car with radio went dead first. Is this ""Toyota quality""?  OMG!  They ought to be ashamed of themselves. Not gonna buy Toyota anymore.  In addition to the radio,  my shock absorber tuber was leaking on the first 3 yrs, Toyota quality was once famous, not anymore! I'll buy Subaru next time."
2019-02-10 00:00:00,,"At about the 4.5 year mark, my radio/navigation console went out with a constant loading screen that changes in brightness sporadically. Not only is it a distraction while driving, but I was told by the dealer the repair would cost $1600 since the general warranty coverage was over past the 3rd year. My USB port is also not working. I bought the car new and this is very upsetting. You expect reliability with Toyota and I am shocked to have issues like these so early on. While searching the internet to solve this electrical issue, I found that this is very common of the 2014 Rav4 at the 4th year."
2017-02-06 00:00:00,,"We don't drive much so we only have about 6800 miles on our 2014 RAV4.  Here are the impressions. 1) Handling low speed is great.  Nimble and quick.  On the highway it's downright dangerous.  Wanders aimlessly with no road feel. Best snow driving car ever, though!  And we have had Jeeps 'forever'. 2) Brakes are terrible but dealer says 'normal'.  As you come to a rolling stop, like a traffic light, the pedal suddenly drop about an inch or more.  You react by pumping to brake to restore height. 3) Transmission shift great up and down.  CVT is impressive.  4) Interior issues include a) the silly armrest slides back and forth about 100 times a day when driving or getting in/out; b) Like most, the backup camera is pretty much worthless during the day/great at night.  Also, the angle of the screen forces the driver to lean to passenger seat to view clearly day or night. 5) Radio is very poor.  Turns on, Changes stations or modes or even volume by itself.  Even if you are not touching the steering wheel at all.  Dealer says 'normal'. 6) Great for little people but sucks if you are tall.  Getting in/out a challenge and, because there is no tilt function on the steering wheel, you smash your knees every time.  7) Annoyances include: a) Cheaped out idea to use the same switch on driver/passenger door locks saved them 10 cents but make it tough to use since lock functions are opposite on passenger door; b)  Downright silly programming on the rear hatch lift.  And poor button placement too.  Needs an exact set of circumstances to allow open/close. b) Also silly programming n the chime alerts.  You'll spend lots of time trying to figure out what it wants and getting it to shut up is often a multi-person game.; c) Information screen is worthless and tiny. d) Seat belt attachment point is too low.  You spend a lot of time just trying to get it high enough to connect. e) Supports for power liftgate are out pretty far.  Be prepared to whack your head often if taller.  New iisues: water flowing in around windshield.  2018 Update: I figured out the screwy radio issues: system remembers even passive steering wheel button contact EVEN WHEN CAR IS OFF.  Then, when you turn he car on, it starts going thru button command you may have accidentally hit while exiting the car.  Very strange.  Just try and replace the rear wiper. All blade  manufzcturers show their blades fit. They do not. Toyota wants you to buy from them alone for big $$$$."
2018-12-13 00:00:00,,"I have a 2014 Rav4. I have had nothing but electrical problems with locks and now my radio/cd/navigation.  I have had electronic malfunction with locks which have been replace numerous times.  It was fine when it was under warranty, but now that it is out of warranty. Right front passenger door won't open with key fob or with button on drivers side.  It needs new actuator to the tune of $260.00, which is simply a magnet in the door to signal the lock to open and close. I called Toyota and they would DO NOTHING.  How can you stand by your quality of your parts which can't even seem to last over a year?  This vehicle is 4 years old.  Now the radio stopped working. Same problem hundreds of others are complaining about with the same year Rav 4.  Are you kidding me? The dealer wants $1200.00 to replace.  I am disgusted in the quality and lack of responsibility of Toyota to stand by it's products and take care of their customers.  Are you looking at these reviews Toyota??  You have a lot of dissatisfied customers."
2018-10-05 00:00:00,,"Good price, looks, and gas mileage. It always starts,good acceleration.     Now.........Problems:  poor paint quality/rusting around doors and lower aspects of car, loud inside/sounds like a semi, rattling sound from dash/unknown origin, radio system went out/a known problem with this vehicle and the dealership repair is about $700, drivers side seat clicks and moves when in locked position, requires a fancy oil change that costs about $65 each time, no response from Toyota from an email detailing complaints, no support from dealership, which I understand, because limited warranty had expired..just as problems started showing up."

2015-02-12 00:00:00,,"After a year and several thousand miles, It is time for a review so others can use as a reference. The gas mileage is as advertised. Average about 26m/gal (mostly highway). City is about 21. Some people complaint about the transmission and the car's power, but it is not true. They must learn how to use eco mode and sport mode to bring out the car true performance (play with shift paddle some time also). With my personal experience, I use eco mode on highway and sport mode on back road or city road. The car has good surrounding view and I love the rear view camera. The cargo area is almost as big as my 1998 grand Cherokee and the rear seats could be folded real flat. 

Review update:

Currently in August 2017, This 2014 RAV-4 has been seized by my wife and I have to use her 2014 Prius-4 to get around town and to commute to work. The RAV-4 still running great without any issue. I just change oil and filter once a year. I did not bring the car back to the local dealer for free oil changes and checkup. I have no trust for anyone but me taking care of any vehicle I own and operate. I still make people mad at traffic lights because they did not believe the RAV-4 could be so responsive  at start (using the sport mode. I also make people mad with my Prius using the Power mode.)

After 3 years driving the 2014 RAV-4, we (my wife and I) have no issues. We found it quite fast when use ""Power"" button. Now the model is becoming old and out of style. I just wish that Toyota will come up with something slightly bigger with more ground clearance, more cargo area and adjustable rear seats (for smart cargo management). put exhaust pipe  in higher place undercarriage. We also want to see more color options for next generation. If we don't see new features, we might have to pick CRV instead."
2018-02-02 00:00:00,,"I have a 2014 Rav4 purchased new.  Has anyone had a problem with their RPM's surging or the Transmission not going into drive or not changing gears after the recalled Torque converter was replaced.  This only happens when it's cold.  My dealership has been trying to find the problem for 2 months to no avail.  I absolutely no problems until the torque converter was replaced.

Update 08/14/18  My dealership (Prince Toyota Tifton Ga) never found a problem.  I had video to prove the problem.  I have had no problem since the weather has been hot.  Only time will tell when winter comes."
2016-07-30 00:00:00,,Before you but a Rav4 there is a engine noise at 55-60 mph. The mechanic says that is normal but did not happen to us until 250 miles was put on the vehicle. Very sad because of the price you have to pay for the Rav.
2018-07-26 00:00:00,,"It seems that Toyota has determined that, like American car manufacturers, customer satisfaction is not as important as making every single penny they can from each customer. Example: after 4 years, the stereo system in our 2014 Rav4 has stopped working and is in a constant rebooting loop. There have been numerous reports of this online and the only solution (according to Toyota) is to purchase a new radio from them. Ridiculous! Toyota has dishonored their family name and is a disgrace to the Japanese  people - shame on them!Performance4 out of 5 stars"

2018-05-15 00:00:00,,"After ""only"" 4 years of having my Rav4 2014 now I don't have a functional sound stereo, instead I have a weird image, I went to Toyota dealer and they didn't find the problem, now I stuck with a vehicle that I didn't pay yet,  with no sound at all,I am very disappointed."

2017-11-30 00:00:00,,This SUV is is quite comfortable it has enough space for running around town but also to go out and camp or do other activities on the weekend. Soft ride when going over 45 mph but a little rough suspension on the rear feels like a truck suspension. One thing i do miss is the sunglasses holder. Also the navigation system seems outdated and the entertainment system is a little on the slow side. Other than that its a all in one package vehicle that feels complete. Haven't had the chance to take it out in the snow but will be doing it later in the year!
2014-11-22 00:00:00,,"I purchased a new RAV 4 in April of this year. My 2014 RAV 4 was the XLE with front wheel drive only which was rated for 24 city and 31 hwy mpg. I have over 5000 miles on it and have taken multiple highway trips and driven it to work locally each day. No mater what driving condition, I have only achieved 24 mpg.  I tried different gas octanes and no difference.  My Mazda's always achieved there rated mileage so the idea of my driving habits have nothing to do with it. This car is a lemon and the dealer will not even talk to me about it. I cannot promote this car that does not do what it was advertised to do.  Two years later and the gas mileage still sucks!  No improvement.
Update-2017: I traded this gas sucking RAV-4 and got a nice Honda CRV that gets 35 mpg as advertised.  On the RAV-4, the Berglund Toyota dealer in Lynchburg VA and Toyota HQ refused to back their advertising and did nothing but try to blame it on my driving! I will never buy or rent any Toyota product until I'm dead and will not drive one in heaven because all Toyota cars and dealers will be in hell!Performance1 out of 5 starsInterior1 out of 5 starsComfort1 out of 5 starsReliability1 out of 5 starsValue1 out of 5 stars"
2017-10-25 00:00:00,,"This is my 2nd RAV4 and will be my last.  It started out pretty great, I bought it new and now have 45K miles.  The sunroof rattles horribly and the dealer will not fix.  The brakes/suspension sound like its eating something yet 3 different shops have told me its just how it was made. As other reviewers have said at certain times of the day the sun hits the chrome interior dash trim and its blinding.  The radio/navigation screen is next to impossible to read in bright light, despite changing settings. The spare tire is only a donut. The seat fabric is wearing unevenly. The rear door/trunk doesn't have any automation and the tiny handle to pull it down is hard to find. The storage is limited and what is there is pretty useless.  All in all, extremely disappointed."
2017-09-13 00:00:00,,"40 months, 60,000+ miles and no major repairs. Just recently replaced tires, and we're happy with how the car has held up. Our only complaint is that the touchscreen has topped working after three years, something we've seen mentioned in RAV4 chat groups. Winter performance in PA has been strong. Would absolutely buy another one. Just got 34 mpg on 300 mile highway drive this past weekend."

If you don't have back problems but want them buy a RAV4. I have owned this for 6 Month's and have to take a loss trading it, it is that bad to sit in. The delay wipe has only 1 speed REALLY??? The cruise control is a lever attached to the steering wheel and when the wheel is in a certain position you tend to hit the wiper control. Brake rotors replaced at 20k not aggressive braking or towing, after much argument dealer replaced rear rotors not pads and wrote on the WARRANTY repair recommending I replace the front rotors, NO MORE TOYOTA'S for me. .

2017-07-30 00:00:00,,"Some reviews on here are a little unfair as they complain about lack of features. I know some of these features are on competitors entry level SUV's. But these people complaining should have paid a little extra to get the Limited version which has the interior rear hatch release, (4) cup holders in the back seats, power drivers seat, back up camera, etc. Front seat is comfortable for me at 6' 1"" and 200lbs. The only small complaint I have is the instrument layout is awkward and sometimes the shifting is noticeable when the air-conditioning is on. Overall I expect to get 3 to 4 hundred thousand out of this vehicle with very little problems, as I have with my other Toyotas."

The front end is so far out of alignment that I must replace tires every 16000 miles or drive on badly, unevenly worn tires.  I have had the car to 3 different alignment shops which verify the car is badly out of alignment.  This is an unfixable problem. Unfortunately it still falls within Toyota's specs.  I guess it is easier to change specs than admit this problem should also have been recalled.  I have also had repeated computer problems.  I feel that this car is unsafe to drive and a money pit."
2016-09-30 00:00:00,,"The ride is very rough , I can feel every single bump on the road. Now I have 32000 on it and dealer was never able to find the suspension issues. Also car seats vibrate because of bad suspension. Car looks great inside and outside, but when driving in city I feel like someone is trying to shaking me from behind.

2015-01-26 00:00:00,,We are a Toyota family having owned 6 cars and a truck but this car has really let us down. The gas milage is terrible. We average 22 and the best we have gotten is 24 on a trip to Florida. The seats are uncomfortable and the back seats have no cup holders or a power outlet. 4 adults fill this thing to the brim. There is no button inside or on the key fob to open the lift gate. It is an option that must be paid for extra. One would think this would be standard on the XLE edition. The touch screen is hard to use and the navigation will not let you make any changes unless the car is in Park. The car does ride and drive smooth but that doesn't make up for the other downfalls.
2014-12-16 00:00:00,,"This is my first Toyota but will be my last.  It has problems from the first month and the dealer is not willing do do any acceptable resolution.
The car runs OK but not better than competitors and there are numerous quality issues.
The navigation is not working properly and lost on the road at least once ever 5~6 uses.  I now use my iphone more due to its reliability.  Seat-belt locks when I put on, so I have to try many times to unlock it.  I often locks when I need to reach the glove box while parked in a parking lot, so I had to take it off.  The rear brakes make strange noise.

2014-10-08 00:00:00,,"1500 miles and three weeks since purchase.
Black with Terra Cotta - I like the interior colors versus all black.
Just finished a road trip. Milage since purchase 26.8 - estimate highway at close to published 29.
It is not a race car but I knew that. Wanted the range of milage we are getting. Enjoy the wide storage in the rear. Better than competition.
Front seat comfort is good - visibility is good using mirrors. Interior style is appealing. 
Challenges - none of which would change my decision. No Homelink - even in Limited trim. Didn't realize and would like. No rain sensing wipers - spoiled with this on another vehicle - and had a very rainy road trip."
2014-09-10 00:00:00,,"Recently traded a 2003 Hyundai Santa fe for the 2014 RAV4. Based mostly on price I leased the car, it's okay but styling is boring, ride is firm, interior is cheap. If a Hyundai dealer would have been closer to home I think I would have stayed with the Hyundai, or a KIA. Inconvenient storage(coins, phone). Seat fold downs in back are okay, but the front seat could have been included to maximize full length hauling . The doors sound cheap/hollow when you close them. Overall a little disappointed, I have never owned a Toyota before, don't think I would get one again."

Interior room is wider and back seat leg room is bigger.

The APPS button on radio is great, Weather provided by Weather Channel, along with traffic.

MPG much better than Escape.
I would highly recommend the Rav4."
2014-04-09 00:00:00,,"I got the top trim level and added remote start, homelink, and a trailer hitch.
Remote start and heated seats are great on those chilly, Midwest mornings.
I am a conservative driver, having traded in a 2008 Prius, and I am routinely getting between 32-33 mpg on the hwy, and about 27-28 in city driving in Eco mode.
This vehicle is fun to drive, and dollar for dollar is the best deal on the market.
I test drove the Honda CRV, Subaru Forester and Crosstrek, and the Mazda CX-5, and none could compare pricepoint and features.
Reliability and comfort have been fantastic!!"
2014-01-31 00:00:00,,"The Rav 4 is a responsive, small SUV and well appointed. The auto liftgate is handy and all the features you might want are available in the Limited. HOWEVER, if you have an I-Phone 4, you will not be able to load the contacts from your phone on to the bluetooth system! Wish they had told us that the contacts would load on the base models, but NOT their top of the line model. If this is important to you, and it should be, look elsewhere."
2023-05-09 00:00:00,,my car has been very good no major problems
2023-03-07 00:00:00,,"In 2017 I was looking at purchasing either a used CR-V or RAV4, so I was looking at the used car sections.  I was lucky enough to find my RAV4 in the exact color combo (blizzard pearl with tan interior) on the Toyota lot.  It had 25K miles on it and drove very well.  Now it has just over 72K miles and hasn't had any major issues, just routine maintenance (oil changes, battery replacement, etc.)  I have taken numerous vacations with this SUV and it held up well to driving in the Blue Ridge Mountains and another trip to Michigan and Canada.  This SUV is very comfortable and has all the bells and whistles I wanted.  The Blind Spot Monitoring and Lane Departure Warning are great safety features.  The only thing my RAV4 doesn't have is a heated steering wheel, but you have to purchase more expensive luxury vehicles to get that feature.  The heated front seats work great during the mild winters where I live.  Now that I've owned this SUV for six years, I look at other vehicles I might want to buy, but I love my RAV4 so much, I can't find anything I like that is better."
2016-07-03 00:00:00,,"I once had a 78 Cadillac Deville.It was like...buttah! But this Rav4? A very close ride.Smooooooooth ride,and it just feels ..luxurious! I have only had it for 3 weeks,but I am amazed every time I drive it! The Honda was a wonderful vehicle,but this? This is like...so luxurious! Actually,even tho it is MUCH bigger? It gets way way better gas mileage.The sound system? Goes up to 60!! Beautiful sound,better than my Bose home sterio..I just wanna sit n my Rav4 an listen to the XM radio all day..Cannot WAIT to take a nice long road trip! Got a stupendous color,and the black interior is so clean and classy.I think.. Cant wait to see what it is like in the winter! Seriously,this Rav4,is a fun driving experience..***Update..So,I love this Rav4 more than I ever thought ,especially this winter!,I put studded snow tires on it,much to the consternation of many of the 'old timers' .But ,I have a job that makes me HAVE to get to it,no matter what,and this has been a heavy duty winter so far.Many times,when I leave for work? The roads have not even been plowed.Im the first one on the road.My sweet Rav4 just eats up the snowy,icy road,like it was made for it! Slow and steady,and it will go anywhere!.For a minute,last fall,I considered trading it in towards a Toyota truck.I am so glad that I didn't! I love this vehicle,and yes,there ARE some blind spots,but Ive learned to work around them..In my opinion? This is the PERFECT winter vehicle.We call it""the Tundra mobile""...Gas milage,in the winter is down to 23 mpg,but its ok.The quality of the ride is amazing! Update..I am still in love with my Rav4.in the 3rd winter..Wonderful.I can go anywhere.STILL! the perfect winter vehicle.+++Update again..after 3 years? I STILL love this vehicle..Yes there are a few annoyances.The interior lights thing,{Youll see} and there are some HUGE blind spots.Luckily I am able to turn and twist and see them,and the camera helps too.To replace the rear wiper blade,you have to have a special tool,or go to a dealer.Other than that? I love it!  update..I still love my Rav4. The only issues have been the tps monitors.They are always on and replacing them {130$ a pop) dosent seem to make any difference..Ie learned to check the tire pressure myself.Cant rely on the monitors. one year later! Still! No problems with this wonderful vehicle except the TPS monitors..Ive replaces all of them.at great expense,but they still light up my dash.Oh well,nothing that some well placed tape cant remedy.Still LOVE my RAV$....same still.What an excellent vehicle!Tps monitors still acting up but thats a small wrinkle.  Update###Ive had this Rav4 for 6 years and it is still the most trustworthy vehicle Ive ever owned! The TPS monitors are just not...able to be fixed,but Ive learned to use a tie presser checker..All in all? A Fabulous vehicle!...year later.still love it.Replaced front and rear brakes,no other maintenance required.,92k miles..Still love this vehicle."
2022-12-30 00:00:00,,"Best Car I've ever driven that is like a truck; plenty of space , easy to load,
gas efficient, handles road very well, as comfortable as a luxury car."
2022-12-24 00:00:00,,"This vehicle has been remarkable for me….I just threw away the original tires.The original battery tested fine….they must have built this little gem on a “good” day because it has been just great….not getting rid of it any time soon and it is almost 2023!mind you…the odometer just turned over to 50,000 kms…..still a great car!"
2015-08-18 00:00:00,,"My speedometer is reading 3 to 4 mph below actual speed according to radar and confirmed by the dealership.  An average speed of 40 mph is a 7.5 to 10% discrepancy.  The warranty is 36,000 miles.  That equals to a loss of 2,700 to 4,000 miles of warranty.  Actual warranty miles will be 32,000 to 33,300.  Toyota refused to fix or replace the speedometer.  I went through arbitration on July 8, 2015.  I lost because there are no laws governing the accuracy of speedometers and that the 3 to 4 mph is within Toyota specifications.  In other words, Toyota dictates the accuracy of its speedometers and can therefore reduce the mileage warranty without the buyer being aware that this is happening.  In my view this is corrupt as I would not have bought the RAV4 if I had known that Toyota is actually selling me a lesser warranty.  Otherwise the vehicle operates fine.  However the screen is very touchy and has a habit of going bonkers.  I recommend using the tip of a pencil or a similar device.  Discard the navigation and have a separate GPS handy.  Again if I had known about the speedometer, I would have purchased an alternate brand as there are many out there.  Great for hauling stuff such as bags of dirt, mulch, compost, trees, rocks, and even 4x8 plywood.  Went tent camping without any problems and ferried it to a couple of islands.   Have taken a couple of 3,000 mile trips:  Speed averaged 75 on one and 83 on the other over plains and mountains.  RAV4 performed flawlessly and had no problems passing other vehicles.  MPG was anywhere from 26 to 29.  On secondary roads on trips the gas mileage averaged 33.   Very quiet engine but outside road noise was very pronounced (loud).  The backup camera and blind spot monitor are great safety devices that if you can afford them, they are worth it.  The lane monitor not very useful because it can't read lanes in a great variety of road conditions.   Very easy vehicle to maneuver and drive.  Learned to appreciate the automatic lights which I now leave on 7/24/365.  Wish it had a stand alone compass as it contained in the navigation screen.  Of course the navigation system is obsolete before you drive it off the lot because the data in the sym card is obsolete and Toyota wants $200 for updates which is again obsolete before you put it in.  Best to use your phone or a Garmin -- your phone is always updated and Garmin you can update it for free.  Does not have Homelink; was almost a deal breaker.  In August/September 2018 completed a round trip from Omaha to New Brunswick, Canada putting over 4700 miles.  Averaged 31.1 mpg going 70 to 75 mph driving west but got a little better driving east.  Again, the operation of this vehicle was -- no other way to say it -- flawless.  Recently moved to New Hampshire and because of the roads dictate the speeds, my mpg has jumped from 27 to 32.  Currently have 78,900 miles on it.  Battery went out at about 65,000 and brakes will need to be replaced at 73,000.  These are expected maintaince items but brakes lasting 73000 is excetional."
2022-05-10 00:00:00,,Just wanted to share that the car is still going strong in 2022. I find the regular driving mode more ecological than Eco for some reason (25mpg combined in Los Angeles). Only things to be aware of are regular replacements like break pads. No major issues otherwise.
2015-11-22 00:00:00,,"December 2021...Some minor changes ... The gas mileage is average for a vehicle of its size. The reliability has been good. But it is a great SUV, plenty of leg room (I am 6' - 1"") as I can really get comfortable in it, the interior is well laid out, love the way they did the leather, the ride is great, handles great for a vehicle its size. It is just the perfect SUV for my wife, dog and I. It is a fun vehicle to drive. Love the AWD (were in a very bad rain storm the other day and it handled outstanding, no problems with the wet roads).  STILL A BIG ISSUE...Still have the issue with the push button start button is that it can be left in another position other than off, in gear or neutral and start rolling forward or backwards even on a slight grade which can present a dangerous situation. Been there, done that and I really do not like the push button. With a key you had to take the key out of the switch, in the key off position with the transmission in park. Definitely a lot safer than the set up you have with the push button start. This has changed as we did not have an issue with the sun roof (another issue arises every year, sometime in late spring I have to take the vehicle in and get them to clean out the drain line for the sun roof. It plugs up at that time (I think it is from all of the pollen in the air at spring time when everything is producing vast amounts of pollen) and water will get in the headliner. It cost me $85.00 each time to get it cleaned out...and I need to clean the water stain out of the headliner. The dealership just states that is just normal...Yea, I bet!!!)"
2021-08-27 00:00:00,,"So we own one 2015 rav4 and we did not have a lot of problems with the car. We thought everything else was fine as well, but there are some other issues appears. First of all, the road noise is not acceptable. We did not notice this issue until we get a new chevy home. It's a significant comparison that the noise person in the second row has to suffer in toyota rav4 versus the noise level in the chevy for the second raw passenger. Also, we drove once on the road and it was very windy, rav4 almost get blew out of the lane and I had to adjust the direction of the steering wheel to be able to stay in the lane. Same windy situation for the chevy, chevy handles it pretty well. Also the transmission seems like very big gaps when the car is accelerating. It is a significant feeling that the car has some gap when transmission is trying to gear up. Information system is just almost not existing, but only for the very basic functions and the reverse camera. Generally saying, the only thing rav4 offers is reliability, but if you care about the comfortable level and more details of the interior just consider some other better choices such as Honda, Mazda, Chevy and so on."
2021-08-19 00:00:00,,"At 3000 one wheel bering start making noise 
Now at 70000 I got suspension problem 
Previous Rav4 drove more than 230 000 with a swaybar replaced… forget about Toyota reliability"
2021-08-15 00:00:00,,at 3000 km front ball bearing was changed now at 70000 km front end noise and it is impossible to drive straight
2017-02-04 00:00:00,,I have owned the car over three years and it has continued to perform as advertised.
2021-03-18 00:00:00,,"We bought our 2015 XLE FWD used in Jan 2018. It had 65k miles on it and was well maintained.

Spacious: Five adults can sit comfortably in this car and the trunk too is very big, with a low loading lip. In fact, you can even use it as a bench to sit on when picnicking. The rear seats fold flat so that you can carry longer cargo. It looks like the later gen model has less passenger and cargo space.

Gas mileage: In city driving, with a few minutes of idling thrown in (to run AC), I get 20-22 mpg. On the highways when I do a constant 75-85 mph, I get 28-31 mpg.

Performance: Good that Toyota hasn't moved to turbocharged engines for their best sellers in the US. Big, simple, naturally-aspirated engines are my favorite for their low-end torque. This vehicle has no problem accelerating and keeping up with 90mph cars on I-5.

Maintenance: No issues besides yearly oil changes and tire rotations done by a neighborhood family-owned mechanic. The first owner bought ToyotaCare. So, it was very well taken care of, at dealership shops. The only unexpected thing I got done was the rear shocks, as one of them started leaking, leading to bouncy ride. The parts too were super cheap, $70 for a set of two."
2021-03-16 00:00:00,,"I just picked up a super clean low mileage 2015 rav 4 xle for my wife. We moved on from a nightmare Honda CRV that was a lemon and broke down constantly and was never diagnosed, we got a BS run around from Honda. They Toyota dealer was awesome, straight forward with no bull. Picked out the car on Sunday and picked it up the next morning out of the dealer in 30 minutes. My son and I both have Tacoma’s so I felt right at home in this rav 4. More solid and roomier than the Honda ,better AWD system. Sold my last Tacoma with 265k running like a top. Unless you can afford an Mercedes buy Toyota"
2017-07-27 00:00:00,,"I still own this car while thinking of trading up to a Hylander. I was surprised over how much more room is in this model now. I am over 6 foot and fit comfortably. This is a well made vehicle. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small comfortable good looking suv. 

It's July 2018 and I still own this car and really like it. I haul grandkids, 2 grand dogs, pine straw, flagstone, mulch and other garden supplies as well as plenty of luggage and coolers when we travel. Good city and road car, Better than average ride and gas mileage. Toyota builds good cars ! Would recommend for the category."
2017-07-08 00:00:00,,"A surprisingly zippy little SUV, but too many negatives. The #1 issue that I have is the squeaks, creaks, and road noise inside this car. I recently discovered an industry term, 'NVH' - which rates Noise, Vibration, and Hazzard. This Rav4 has the WORST NVH rating. Sure wish I knew about this term prior to purchasing this car. On the hunt for a top rated NVH vehicle. I purchased this vehicle brand new, 2015 Rav4 Limited. Within the first few months, the dashboard began squeaking and creaking - I have a TBI, and cannot tolerate this type of noise. Plus, the road noise coming up into the car from the tires, frame, etc - is brutal. The dealership said that Toyota has 'templates, of an absorbing type of material. The dashboard would be dropped, template installed, problem fixed. Well, that particular squeak and rattle anyway. They informed me that if they went ahead with this repair, they would need to drop the entire dashboard - separating thousands of 'contact points within the dashboard - and the end result would be LOTS of more squeaks. Wow. Also, very very tight seating, even in the front seats. Unless you are a 'petite' person, and do not have any issues with serious road noise in the car while driving, it is a fun little car to bop around with, and the cargo room is fantastic. Update January 2021: Still do not like this car, for the same reasons posted. Plus it is also very top heavy with a very narrow base. But the gas mileage is quite impressive, especially when in the 'Economy Mode'. I would NOT recommend the Toyota Rav4."
2020-07-29 00:00:00,,"I have the white and so far had to have the roof repainted. Where shift is, it has gap I almost got some change in it.I glued some rubber to avoid that. It should have a boot on it. The horn sounds wimpy.There is no place to put your sun glasses. No garage door opener. I have put 10,000 on it no problems, so that is good."
2016-01-27 00:00:00,,"I traded a 2006 4 Runner for the Rav4, and I was impressed with the room. Although a bit smaller, the gas savings, the Rav4 is below others in it's class. If you have a big family think a larger vehicle, but for two or a young family (or retiree like me) it is OK. Go the extra mile and get the Convenience Package it makes driving much more enjoyable. 
After driving it for over 6 months, I wish It would have power seats. The XLE is uncomfortable on longer trips.

I finally decided on a Subaru Crosstrek, and like it 90% better than the Toyota Rav4. Better vision, handling and comfort on a trip."
2020-07-08 00:00:00,,"This is the most reliable vehicle ever. Handling, size, gas mileage, smooth ride, I LOVE it! However, the seats are not comfortable at all, and on top of that, my driver seat won’t raise me high enough to be safe. The almost crashed my amazing RAV yesterday because I’m 5’2 and the seat won’t raise high enough for me. There is a foot between my head and the roof at the highest seat position."
2020-05-15 00:00:00,,"Great in the snow, Handles and rides nice."
2020-03-13 00:00:00,,"Great all around vehicle. Handles good under all weather conditions,  except ice of course."
2020-03-03 00:00:00,,"We got our Rav with 13,000 miles on it. It now has 45,000 miles on it. Only issue was that it did not start once (Battery needed to be replaced). Other than that, we haven’t had any issues, just oil changes. We have taken it on several long road trips without problems. 27-28 mpg average driving very conservatively. Smooth ride with more than enough power for acceleration. Decent amount of space when rear seats are folded down. Overall, I would recommend this vehicle."
2020-02-27 00:00:00,,The Transmission have a problem... I change 2
2019-12-31 00:00:00,,"I bought used 2015 Toyota RAV4 limited AWD about two years ago with 28000 miles on it still under factory warrantee
I like the power jus like turbo, fast and super good in snow and wet conditions
Never had any problems,everything work great
Not good on gas, usually put it on eco mode city driving
Love BSM and LDA
Ground clearance 6 inch not that good"
2019-11-06 00:00:00,,Toyota quality is a joke.  False advertising.  At 20k brakes making noise. At 35k Car gas pedal is dead.  Car starts but when put in gear does not move.  Have to tow it to the dealership. Noise coming from right front suspension.  Called Toyota corporate and they could care less.   Would never purchase this brand again.
2019-10-25 00:00:00,,Just a GREAT car!
2019-10-11 00:00:00,,I purchased the limited addition. Handles well. Comfortable. Very good gas mileage. And the bills and whistles far exceed the cost far exceed the costs. Well worth the buy

2019-04-24 00:00:00,,Very reliable vehicle with mininal maintenance
2019-01-03 00:00:00,,"I bought this RAV4 over three years ago. No problems at all. I have 50,000 miles on it. I've been all over the country in it. Comfortable, plenty of storage, great gas millage, plenty of power. I also tow a 1300 lb pop up tent trailer for camping. Hopefully I get 250,000 miles out of it like my old one!"
2015-05-28 00:00:00,,"This is a great SUV with great handling, peppy engine, solid ride and economical. Driven it for over 8,000 miles now including a 1,600 mile trip up north. The Rav4 rides like a dream, but the best thing is how it does it. The 6 speed automatic transmission is silky smooth and always at the right gear. The engine purrs, it's quiet, peppy and dependable. When you crank it up in the mornings, there are no weird noises, no piston or valves noises, it just starts quietly and efficiently. I'm getting about 23 mpg in the city, about 31 on the highway.  By all means this vehicle is way much better than my previous Subaru Forester.A
Update:  At 13,500 miles the Rav4 has been handling very well.  Still rides great and shifts like new.  This is one great vehicle!"
2018-11-24 00:00:00,,"Most of the car is great, but there are some drawbacks.  If you really want a car where you can see the instrument panel, this is not it. My wife still does not see the temperature gauge and with good reason.  Even on clear days, reading the instrument panel, especially if there is bright sunlight.  Didn't Toyota ever hear of light bulbs?  There are times when you have a hard time even seeing the speedometer.  teh controls for heated seats and the toggles for the sport and eco modes are almost hidden from view.  The car does run well and is more quite than most cars I have driven.  The ride, though a little stiff, is fine and the handling is great.  If they correct the problems mentioned here, I will  buy a 2019 model."
2018-11-19 00:00:00,,Had a great time working with Luther the car wasn’t exactly what I was looking for. But he did his best showing me a 18 model and made me a proud owner lol. Thank you!
2018-11-11 00:00:00,,This is a grate suv fun to drive with a good price
2018-10-26 00:00:00,,"I drove this car for a little over a year. Never had a problem with anything. I loved her so much. I had put her through a couple fender benders but she was going strong. Once I was hit in the driver's door by a 90s RAV4 going 35 mph that left a sizable dent, but my passengers and I were fine. We eventually had to part ways when I was hit by a drunk driver, flipped twice, and landed upside down. I walked away very shaken up but completely unharmed. My only ""injury"" was some bruising from the seatbelt (but I maintain that was because I was hanging upside down for a few minutes before I was rescued). I had a 2015 LE model afterward, and it didn't hold up as well on slick roads but still a beautiful car. For comparison, I drove a 2012 VW Passat for 8 months and loved it but not as much as my RAV4, and then I had a 2016 Hyundai Tuscon for a few months and hated it. I would recommend everyone drive a RAV4, or at the very least a Toyota."
2018-09-21 00:00:00,,"I bought the Toyota rava 4 2015 in the first year it started making that squik noice in the brakes, went to the dealer store and they said the brakes pad need to be replace $250 , 1 more year of use and the same problem arise , I will contact Toyota main office to file a claim  this SUV must be recalled ,there are other so many customer facing  the same problem . I will make sure not to purchase a Rava 4 ever again."
2018-09-07 00:00:00,,"I’ve really enjoyed the past three years driving my RAV.  Now that my lease is coming to an end, I am seriously considering purchasing this RAV or another one with a few more features that I have missed.  I prefer to have automatic headlights, more precise low tire information, and power seats.  But I love the ease of doing and parking with this car. It’s been a fun car to drive."
2018-08-14 00:00:00,,"I had a wonderful experience .Chris Zymierski was extremely helpful,friendly and professional.Definitely i will recommend Mr.Chris Zymierski!!!"
2018-01-09 00:00:00,,"The only ""complaint"" I have so far is that the oil-change light comes on after 5000 miles instead of the 10000 mile service life of the oil. But it's easy enough to reset. Also I am not fond of the location of the cruise control lever. But that's the worst of it."
2015-12-29 00:00:00,,This is my first suv. VERY Impressed with the quality and road handling.  First snowsorm will be the true test.
2015-12-21 00:00:00,,"The brakes are awful.  Pedal sinks to floor while coming to slow stops.  Requires pumping to bring pedal up.  Dealer says everything in spec..  Next issue is steering.  The electric steering is very nimble but car wanders around lanes at highway speed.  You can hold the steering wheel rock steady and still drift in and out of you lane,  Dealer says everything in spec.  Last issue is the radio.  It changes modes, volume goes up and down by itself and, on the way home from the last service at Toyota, it turned itself on with high volume.  Less than 5000 miles since new.  

It's a cute, nimble car around town and the best snow vehicle we ever owned (traded in a Jeep).  If someone would address these issues it could be a real winner.

06/2017
Rear camera is great at night.  Completely worthless during the daylight hours or in rain  The angle of the srceen is great for back seat people but worthless for driver or passengers  up front.  Cannot safely be used.

Constant chimes and alerts are way overdone.  Many times, the alerts point to no cause and we give up and walk away with the beeping or chimes.  Sometimes not possible since doors won't lock.  Crazy.

Windshield is leaking some clear polymer.  Strangest thing evet.  First thought it was tree sap but it only appears in the exact same places.

This 'legendary' Toyota quality is a fraud.  So many simple things gone so wrong.  Last Toyota in our household.

Update 12.28.17 Still runs well and mileage is improving.  Some other things you should be aware of include: FEW BACKLIT SWITCHES. Very dangerous at night since placement of switches is downright silly at times. Not knowing what a switch does make it dangerous.  EXTREMELY POOR INTERIOR LIGHTING No lighting would be a better description.  Now that days are short you realize that there are virtually no lights throughout the interior - but especially in the rear areas.LACK OF A TRUE ADJUSTABLE STEERING WHEEL It moves about 4 inches up/down and the up lift height  is a joke. INFORMATION PANEL IS A JOKE Utterly worthless due to small size. INTERIOR PANELS LIGHTS DIM TOO MUCH  If your put your headlights on with your wipers (a law in our state) display lights like the clock are invisible..  CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW POOR THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN IS Because it does not adjust it is only useful at night. And even then you must lean over the center console to see it.  Dumb, dumb.  WATCH YOUR HEAD WITH THE POWER TAILGATE LIFT TUBES. Unique problem here. They are positioned perfectly to smash your head. I also have a Dodge Grand Caravan that does not cause brain damage."
2015-05-27 00:00:00,,"I waited to write this review, since I wanted to take a decent road trip.  Having just got back from a trip to and from Ohio to SC, I now feel I can write an honest review.  This is a great vehicle.  I have owned Hondas for the past 25 years or more, the latest being a 2008 CR-V, and was bored with the same interior look and features.  I test drove multiple vehicles, SUVs and sedans.  The RAV 4 is extremely nice looking (Pearl White) and runs and rides perfectly.  Got 29.6 miles per gallon on average, using heat, defrosters and air conditioning through rain, fog, and sleet. The RAV-4 Limited offers a comfortable ride, great handling. The heated seats/lower back are outstanding No complaints.  ****UPDATE**** Ater having this RAV4 for almost 3 years now, and after several long road trips, it continues to make me happy. The only problem I've had is that the tire pressure sensors are extremely sensitive and tend to show low air pressure frequently in winter months with temperature changes. Otherwise, the ride, acceleration, and gas mileage is great. Averaged 30 to 31 mpg on our most recent trip from Ohio to SC.   The power in the normal mode is so good for passing or entering freeways that I have never switched into sport mode. The economy mode's mpg was equal to using the normal mode, so why have a more sluggish vehicle and not gain anything? I drive in the normal mode all the time and with combined city and highway driving, usually average around 28 mpg and 27 in the winter.  Have had many back seat passengers remark on how roomy and comfortable the back seats are. Oil changes are a bit more expensive due to using synthetic oil.  The only changes I woukd make to do something with the cup holders, which are too deep for some items, adding a smaller, covered storage area for a cell phone or similar,  a button to program the garage door opener, and automatic headlights when windshield wipers are in use, and better speakers as the sound is not the greatest at lower levels. That being said, even without those fixes we would purchase the RAV4 again, without hesitation.  UPDATE: May 2018, now have almost 40,000 on the car. Still getting good gas mileage, recently 30 mpg on a trip from Ohio to SC. My only complaint is that the middle dashboard area where the console is has some squeaks and rattles that is annoying. Plastic on plastic, I guess. Otherwise, hauled two boxes with fully assembled outdoor rocking chairs in it a month ago, they fit perfectly. Lots of room I. The cargo area with the seats down. Have driven on many long road trips and the seats are comfortable, the ride is nice and the engine never struggles, even in the mountains. Great acceleration for passing.  Overall very happy with this vehicle. In fact, my husband wants me to get a new one so he can have this one, and I am not ready to part with it.Technology4 out of 5 starsPerformance5 out of 5 starsInterior4 out of 5 starsComfort5 out of 5 starsReliability5 out of 5 starsValue5 out of 5 stars"

2015-12-11 00:00:00,,"I have had this car about a month.  I live in the mountains and wanted a car with decent acceleration that would be good in winter weather.  The 2.5 engine has been fine even on steep hills at altitude.  I've driven it in snowy, icy conditions (with snow tires) and it handles well and feels smooth.  The automatic transmission can slide over to manual and a nudge of the shift lever up or down changes the gear.  This gives the car the clutch breaking of a standard transmission and I have used it on icy, snowy downhills when I don't want to brake a lot.  At first, I used the sport setting on hills, but I've found it climbs as well on the normal setting.  I got the Limited because I love the push button start (I'm a key loser) and the automatic headlights.  I also like the vinyl seats which are easy to wipe clean.  The technology features are helpful.  For example, a yellow light appears on the side mirrors when a car is in your blindspot and, when you're in reverse there is a warning if something is about to pass behind.  

Update- have the car 8 months- 10,000 miles
No mechanical problems.  
Driving this winter, it was really handy to be able to push a button and go into 4 wheel drive.  Twice during snowy, icy weather, I used it on an uphill highway ramp.   The second time, a light on the dash flashed ""4 wheel drive not on"" or something like that--hint, hint.  It gave me instant traction and shuts off around 25 mpg.  The all wheel drive was really excellent the rest of the time. 

Pros   
Roomy.  Decent back seats and plenty of storage area.
Headlights and fog lights great on dark roads
Smooth ride with good feel of the road
Two memory settings for the drivers seat!  I am 5'2"" and everyone has to move my seat.  My 6'2"" husband is comfortable as a passenger.  

Cons
Radio with Sirius is a touch screen-  It takes a lot of attention off the road to change stations or settings and it's impossible to see if the sun is hitting it.  Also there are no preset buttons for the radio.  I can change preset stations (on the touch screen) from the steering wheel but I still have to look down too much to see what is on.  

Short back window so the rear wiper only cleans a small area.  

Overall I'm happy with the car.  I haven't had problems with it so far.

12/17
I ended up trading  this car because I found the controls unsafe. I do mostly highway driving.  The Rav4 had a large busy touch screen that took a lot of attention while driving; not just because of the reflection from sun, but listings of radio stations (I have SiriusXM),  for example were small, and I needed to look down at the screen, even with the steering adjustment.  The heat mode control was in the center and low, with small stick pictures of the heat/def selected.  Also the on/off switch for the blind spot monitor is low on the right of the steering wheel and I accidentally shut it off once getting in with snow pants.  I tried to remember to check that the light was on when I started driving.  There are no dashboard warnings when it and other features, except for traction control, are off or on.  

I wanted a car with all wheel drive and I like all the techie features.  I got a 2017 Impreza Limited with Eyesight because it had a simple touch screen plus a screen on top of the dashboard, in the middle of the windshield, that shows radio info, heat/AC settings, etc. without looking down.   Also dashboard warnings when something is turned off or not working because of weather, etc.   It also has CarPlay, an app you can use with an iPhone and use voice commands (Siri) for navigation, etc."
2015-06-10 00:00:00,,"I get about 25.5 mpg overall. Gas mileage is up 3 mpg since a moved near the expressway. The cabin is fairly quiet and the ride is decent. Acceleration is adequate.  The seats fold down flat for over 73 cf of space. I love the way the sound system reads back texts aloud and the bluetooth is easy to pair and works flawlessly. Braking is excellent even on wet pavement. I have not heard any wind noise. The interior plastic scratches a bit easy, and that is my only gripe. I plan on leasing a new 2018 Rav4 LE come May. That model has all the safety features that are missing from the 2015 Rav4 LE."
2017-09-27 00:00:00,,"After reviewing competitive pricing online for Toyota RAV4's for cost perspective, we visited this dealer with our wish list and were immediately taken to a spotless 2015 RAV4 with unbelievably low mileage.  We would describe the car as ""barely driven"".
Anticipating a high price tag for this almost new car, we were very pleasantly surprised at the asking price.  We did not hesitate to secure the deal.
Our salesman knew his inventory.  After listening to our requirements, he understood our needs and simplified the process by offering 2 possible vehicles that would meet our specifications.   
What we thought would be a stressful search for a ""new"" car turned out to be anything but stressful. 
Steve Skolnick, our salesman, was happy and we were happy after a short transaction.  
We love the car and our pleasant sales experience!"
2017-09-25 00:00:00,,"This is my second RAV4 after driving a 2005 RAV LE for 12 years. I had no problems with the car and decided the flexibility of this model was worth continuing into my next car. I bought a CPO RAV4 2015 XLE. Lots of additional features on this one of course and the same solid vehicle I am used to. Visibility is slightly worse in the newer RAVs since they changed the design to eliminate that rear door and replace it with the lift gate. I am still adjusting to some of the changes but overall this is a great and reliable car. The seats now fold almost flat in the rear to create a cargo hold rather than having to remove them entirely. This is a plus. The rear seats also recline, it may be one of the most comfortable back seats out there. The ride is smooth (although in my case the shocks are  also newer, have to consider that!). Cup holder is better, it is deep well works fine and does not have any parts that need to be adjusted around your cup. Many added safety features compared to the 2005 and this is something I really like too."
2017-07-27 00:00:00,,"I debated between the Rav4, the Honda CRV, and the Kia Soul. All three were similar with regards to safety, but there were a just a couple of things about the Rav4 that edged it out over the CRV and Kia Soul with regards to safety. They were minor, but for me they mattered. I will state that prior to purchasing the Rav4, I had been driving a Toyota Sienna mini van for ten years (another GREAT vehicle!), so I was a little more Toyota aimed anyway. Regardless, I test drove all the vehicles. I did really like the Kia Soul, but at the time I had three cats and one dog, and I was soon going to be moving almost 700 miles away, so I needed a vehicle with the storage enough in the back for four animals. The Soul has a roomy storage space, but the Rav4 is bigger with regards to storage. That storage space is probably what edged the Rav4 out over the Kia Soul. The Honda CRV is another great car, but they are pricier.  The Rav4 had the space I needed, and the price I wanted, as well it was a Toyota product which I had become accustomed to driving. The car is comfortable, and transported myself and my four animals during the move comfortably. It is peppy and fun! Big enough that I don't feel swallowed by larger cars on the road, but small enough that I don't feel like I am taking up the road when I drive it. What would I change? Not much. I would prefer if the air conditioner had vents in the back and front. My vehicle only has A/C vents in the front. As well, Toyota has a thing about creating vents that can't be fully closed. This is an issue when someone up front is cold. So I would prefer if the side vents could close for passengers. However, this is a minor issue as typically I am the only individual in the car. Also, my particular model does not have electronic controls for adjusting the seat. I was quite surprised by this. That I would change, as it makes adjusting the seat a bit easier if the controls are electronic. As with my previous Toyota Sienna, the driver's window has an ""auto"" control on the window, so all you have to do is tap it and it rolls itself down by itself. With my Sienna, you could also use the ""Auto"" switch to allow the window to raise itself. My Rav4 does not have the ""Auto"" ability to raise the window. I would change that. These are the only things I would change, and they are extremely minor. They do not detract from my enjoyment of the car. Nor do they detract from the vehicle's performance. Given that my vehicle is two years old some of these things might have been changed already.  I would recommend a Rav4 to anyone who asked about it, and have done so. I love my 2015 Rav4!"
2016-01-24 00:00:00,,"I previously owned a 2007 RAV4, traded it in for a Ford Escape in 2012, and traded it in for a 2015 RAV4, that was a demo with 5,000 miles.  I like all the new features in the Limited, eg. power lift back door, navigation/maintenance screens, many app's, etc., a few extra conveniences that I am loving!  UPDATE AFTER 28,800 miles:  Continuing to be very pleased with my RAV4!  No complaints!  I went back to see Candace, my sales person, once and was happy to see she was still selling Toyota's. Thank you, Toyota, for building another very sturdy SUV!

2017-07-04 00:00:00,,"I love having head and leg room.  The seat of my Jeep was more comfortable for me than the RAV, but my husband likes it better.  I slip a pillow behind me so it feels like heaven.  The room is great over our Jeep Liberty.  Drove it 2,500 miles the first week and it just floated down the road.  We seemed to get about 28 miles to mpg from our calculations. We love RAV4's."
2015-11-23 00:00:00,,I didnt notice during the test drive because it was almost dark already. The hood is bouncing even at low speed and more on high speed. According to the technician from Toyota USA it is normal because they made the Rav4 body thinner than the previous for more mileage. Biggest mistake of my life but I learned a lot with this experience. Just waiting one more year coz still upside down. I will definitely trade this car.

2015-11-06 00:00:00,,"Bought a limited and have found out that the front seats are made for people under 6'. Drivers side is too narrow for comfort. Your right leg will ride on side buttress and not on seat cushion.  On long rides, you will be very  uncomfortable. It was my mistake and I will have to live with it. When you are test driving a new car, you tend to look at all of the bells and whistles, and forget about comfort. Please do not make my mistake. A very costly mistake.  I love Toyota's- had a Camry before the limited. Wow-talk about opposites-going from comfort and quiet, to noise and, ""can't wait to get out of that seat"" vehicle. Be wise and TAKE YOUR TIME"". Remember, there is a big difference between a regular car and an SUV.  You will be giving up comfort and noise level.  *** Update-5-6-17!  Car still uncomfortable for me. Still paying for a car I do not like. Would like to sell it and go back to a Honda or Toyota sedan-more comfort, more cargo space, better gas mileage! As for gas mileage- always subtract at least 5 MPG from window sticker. Getting around 22-23 MPG combined. Glad gas is cheap at this moment! As for the positives- looks good, made very well, tight body, tight engine- in other words, a Toyota!!"
2017-04-18 00:00:00,,We have three large dogs and needed more room in the back. Rear seats fold down flat and they have lots of head room. Took out lots of SUV's for test rides and the RAV4 was the most comfortable. Great pick up and handling.
2016-03-31 00:00:00,,"We are leasing the 2015 RAV4 AWD 6A LE, replacing a  comparable 2012 RAV4.  We do a lot of long distance highway driving and find it very comfortable.  Overall it is a step improvement over the previous model and we are happy with it, though  it is no luxury  vehicle.  Of the other SUV's we considered, it was the best manufacturer's lease deal.   We've been leasing to wait for better SUV fuel economy breakthroughs.  Now that a RAV4 Hybrid is available, that is our top purchase candidate.  

We considered Honda CRV, Subaru Forester, and Subaru Outback.  The much more expensive Outback was the best riding, best MPG, most luxurious , and much quieter, but we preferred the upright seating and compacter wheelbase of a true SUV.  Of the 3 true SUVs the Toyota was the quietest (both Honda and Subaru still have unacceptable highway wind noise after all these years) and smoothest handling at highway speeds.  

Like its 2012 predecessor, our RAV4 was flawlessly constructed.  The engine purrs and acceleration is very smooth.  Handling is good considering the higher center of gravity and weight of an SUV (Forrester wins in this category with it's boxer engine).  In strong wind at highway speed handling is jittery due to the high profile and short wheelbase- a lot of micro steering adjustments may be required.  

Mileage is decent, but not exceptional, and little better than the previous model despite the addition of an extra gear.  If I keep it under 65 mph I can handily beat the EPA highway 29 MPG rating.  However, on a recent 1200 mile highway drive at 80+/- mph, with some frantic stop and going around metro Washington DC, we averaged 27.6 mpg.  Overall I have averaged 26.1 mpg in normal driving mode, lighting up the green ECO LED most of the way.  2017 UPDATE: Just drove 1150 miles from FL to PA with several half hour traffic crawl delays, otherwise averaging 70-80 mph with average mpg of 29.5 in eco mode.

I have no problem with the electronic displays and controls.  Find them useful, easy to read, and intuitive.  Backup camera with guidelines is a great feature.  Basic stereo sound is nothing special; works well with USB or music player, easy to set up blue tooth connections.    It pisses me off that Toyota doesn't include a driver lumbar support in anything but the XLE model.  Seats are fairly comfortable though better for me if I use a  Back Joy Sit Smart.  Some other areas where you now get less than in the previous model: no overhead sun glass holder, only one in-dash storage box and a useless shelf above it, less console storage, glove box does not lock, no cross bars (but a cheap after market purchase if you need it, and at least you get roof rails on the basic models unlike the CRV), no back seat fold down lever in the storage area, no VARIABLE control for intermittent wiper, no full size spare, plastic wheel covers instead of finished steel wheels.  The extra charge floor mats are very cheap, better to get something after market.  Some pluses versus 2012, ours included a rear storage cover, backup camera, the rear seat headrests can be easily folded down to improve rear view visibility, in car spare storage and upswing rear door  makes rear access much easier, better MPG feedback tools,  quieter ride.

Rear visibility is excellent (much better than CRV).  However, the forward descending body side lines throw you off when trying to  align the car in a parking space.  Cannot see speedometer when driver seat position is elevated."
2015-09-12 00:00:00,,"We have had a lot of call backs and never ending problems with the engine lights. Do not think I would buy another Rav4
The hood of the car blows up like it is loose. Not good"
2017-02-11 00:00:00,,"First and foremost, you will NEVER EVER see anything close to 30mpg. If the wind is pushing you from behind and you are going down a large mountain slope you may get 27. But I average close to 23 mpg highway. Maybe 24 mpg on a good day if the wind is just right.  However 50-60 mph seems to be its sweetspot, you will average 35 or better, but for whatever reason once you hit the highway doing 70+ its all over. So on that end you are better off buying something with a V-8. Power is adequate but if you want to pass somebody it takes a while. The brakes are noisey especially if it sits outside for more than 12 hours, the rotors rust up very fast, but the noise goes away after 10 minutes of driving. Had an issue with a window leak the first day of my lease. Interior is roomy, very easy to get in and out of. Older friends getting in and out of the back seat sing praises. Back seats recline which is nice and also fold down for much needed room when moving large items. Dirt and road salt seem to find its way easily under the door trim which tells me in a few years you can count on rust issues. The 4wd is nice. It does what it's supposed to. Gives you the confidence to drive in almost any driving conditon. Overall, the LE model is basic transportation. Nothing flashy. Nothing to brag about, it just gets you to your destination and back. If it truly got 30mpg, I would like it much more and I'd probably keep it, but the fuel economy is what kills it for me."

2017-02-01 00:00:00,,"Worked for 8 years in Japan (Okinawa) and had three ""used"" Toyotas (fantastic vehicles - only thing I had to do was replace battery - tires - brakes ... AC on my Noah Lite Ace Van (8 years old when I bought it) didn't even require maintenance in 8 years of use in a the tropical environment of Okinawa)!!!  Alternatively this vehicle has disappointed, to say the least.  Acceleration is dangerous (in that you must wait 1 - 2 seconds for the computer to figure out what pressing on the accelerator means).  Here in Denver when you change lanes you need to make your move upon turning on your signal - have had close calls when other drivers (whose vehicles accelerate crisply) shot into a lane I was trying to get into.  Also, worse yet, this vehicle rolls backwards if you're on a steep upward grade when you put it in drive!!!  Very dangerous if anyone is behind you (dealer told me to increase revs when I'm in this situation ... if this was a manual that'd be a given ... but this is an automatic)!  So if you live somewhere like San Francisco this is the last vehicle you want to buy.  I'm very disappointed in Toyota ... perhaps it's because it's made here (as stated, the Toyotas I had in Japan were head-and-shoulders better than this Toyota-Japan-wanna-be).Technology2 out of 5 starsPerformance2 out of 5 starsInterior2 out of 5 starsComfort3 out of 5 starsReliability2 out of 5 starsValue2 out of 5 stars"

Don't buy one!"
2016-03-23 00:00:00,,"After driving four other brands in the Rav4 class, we felt it was the best compromise of spacious interior, comfort and mileage. The ability of the back seats to fold flat easily was a factor when compared with Volkswagen. A conventional automatic transmission was our choice over the Subaru and Honda CVT. The ride quality and looks of the VW and Subaru was superior to the Rav4 however.

After 5000 miles in the Toyota  I  would recommend driving some additional cars before selecting the Rav4. The cold start up is very annoying, instantly going to 2400 rpm instead of just starting and idling. The dealer says that is ""normal"". It may be normal, if so,  Toyota needs to change the design. Also the stereo is not intuitive to set up or use. You cannot delete a station, it can only be replaced with another, and occasionally  the touch screen seems to lock up and refuses any command.

This is my first automatic transmission car in a very long time, so I've had to make very sure not to use my left foot. If you even touch the brake pedal while accelerating the ecm commands the engine to idle. At least that's what Toyota says I did when attempting to merge into traffic and the throttle had no response. An interesting solution to unintended acceleration!

The Rav4 seems to be a dependable, use full automobile that is uninspired in every category so far.

As a follow up to the original review, Toyota and the local dealer say that the extremely hi rpm start is working as designed and that here is no way to change the idle. As to the brakes, they to are operating as designed- soft and mushy. I'm impressed with the increasing power the engine has  as it starts to break in. Also the small turning radius of the car is very impressive. So, a great working car that doesn't make me love it."
2016-09-18 00:00:00,,"Husband has owned Toyota trucks for 20 years.  We averaged 27 mpg on a 2000 mile trip through Colorado and New Mexico, with several mountain passes. It gets the job done!  Our RAV has 21,000 miles now and it's great for everyday use.  Bought it for the AWD for winter weather.  It handles very well in snowy slippery streets.  Disappointed it only had one car charger for our cell phones and garmin, plus the 1 usb port.  Our first long trip was a 12 hour drive to south Texas this spring.  That was when we realized the seats felt terrible. I drove 2 Honda Civics for 100K+ miles each and never felt the discomfort/pain that we have with this suv.  When the opportunity comes, I'm going back to driving a Honda."
2016-08-28 00:00:00,,"This car is SUPER reliable. I have had zero issues with this vehicle and expect to drive it for many years to come. The quality on the interior certainly leaves a bit to be desired, but after trading in my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (w 28k miles), I know better than anyone that all the fancy features and cabin comfort in the world do not make up for a mechanically unreliable vehicle. The Jeep was one problem after another, despite having very low miles.

In comparison, the Rav4 has needed nothing since the day I drove it off the lot. If some cheap details in the cabin are the worst thing about this SUV, then you know it's a good vehicle. Toyota did not cut corners where it truly counts with this vehicle (i.e. under the hood), except I guess people are upset about the v6 option dissolving. However, the 4 cyl is just fine for me. Do NOT buy this car expecting a luxury ride--buy this car because you want a vehicle that will get you where you need to go no matter what, and will last you 10+ years with minimal problems. Who cares if people think it's ""boring"" to drive? After my Jeep nightmare, I can tell you that it is WAY more boring to sit at a dealership for hours waiting for repairs!!

 When you start up the Rav you know you will get to your destination no matter what. At the end of the day, that's all I care about. If you're a buyer with similar priorities, you'll love the 2015 Rav4"

In the Fall, I took it on it's first long journey to take my son to college, several hours away...and for the first time my back was KILLING me after just a couple hours non stop driving . It was then, I realized just how uncomfortable the drivers seat was....no adjustable lumbar support, no good thigh support.  I used wedges, pillows, side leg support ...anything to help the leg and hip pain. Nothing worked.  I ended up using my old Ford Expedition for long trips the remainder of the year.  Never had issues with comfort in the Ford or even my wife's Nissan Altima.  Traded the Rav4  ( and Expedition) a year later for a 2016 Kia Sorento, which I made sure to take on a prolonged test drive before buying. Needless the say, the Kia's seats are excellent.  ........If you find the seats in your Rav comfortable, then yes, the Rav4 is an excellent choice and should provide reliablity and value for years and years."

2016-05-17 00:00:00,,"I owned an original 1996 RAV4 as my first car and was curious to drive the newest version 20 years later. 

The original RAV4 was like all the other small SUV's of the day. Cute, compact, good mileage and a fair amount of utility. Mine was the forest green, but the hood paint was flaking off for whatever reason. The radio only worked in one speaker and I couldn't tune too high on the radio dial or I got static. If I floored it, not a whole lot happened and I had to carry around a can of WD40 in the winter, because the locks froze open. But it ran like a champ for the most part and was cheap to maintain. 

My wife and I got a 2015 Toyota RAV4 AWD XLE on loan from our local dealer thanks to a recall on my wife's 2008 Scion TC. So naturally, I was curious. How did 20 years of evolution measure up to the original? 

The new one is a lot bigger than the old one. I was impressed with the space in my RAV, but this car has to be twice as big. It's really wide too and the driving position is a lot higher. It almost feels like you're sitting on a milk crate, with a wide view of the road and your surroundings. The load floor in the back is still low and I imagine there isn't much you can't fit in the back. There's some neat cubbie holes in the dashboard and console as well. 

The acceleration is definitely better than the original, thanks to about 50 more HP, but a bigger car carries more heft and you can feel it. From the numbers, it's dropped about 1.5 seconds in 0-60, but it could use more oomph. The handling leaves something to be desired too. The new RAV4 is easy over bumps, stops well, is very quiet on the road and the wheel is light and easy. But man, is it boring. Sport mode just means a feeling of more power, but nothing else. 

My old RAV4 was mostly unremarkable. It had its flaws, but for the most part it got me where I needed to go with minimal issues. I put 145k miles on it and only traded in because the AC failed and would have cost more than the car was worth to fix it. I saw it a couple of weeks ago actually and has to be well over 200k in miles by now. 

It's great great grandson seems poised to do more of the same. Makes sense as that's what Toyotas are these days for the most part. If you want something to get you to where you need to go with minimal effort, this is the car for you. If you need something that moves the needle a little more and gives you some driving excitement, this may not be the best choice. 

Perhaps that's why I traded in the old RAV4 for a Subaru."
2016-05-12 00:00:00,,Purchased a RAV4 2015 limited. Like the car but wish they would change the side mirror design very bad blind spot. Was just in a accident because of blind stop. Anyone else have this problem?
2016-04-28 00:00:00,,"Try before you buy! When we needed more cargo room to take daughter and dorm stuff back to school 100 miles away we killed 2 birds with one stone. Were considering a new Rav but a 10 minute test drive IS NOT enough so we rented a 2016 Rav4 Limited which was hard to find for rent and seemed to ride the same as a 2015 we had driven prior. The car served its purpose in 2 ways: 1: It got the job done. 2: It convinced us to keep our 2011. Why? Ok so if you drive mostly smooth highways it's ok. When tooling around/commuting on anything else it rides like a brick (yes tire psi correct) You feel every imperfection on the road.The other annoyance is the 6 speed which in theory makes sense but it's annoying as it constantly hunts for gears. The 15/16 just have an overall cheap feel inside and out including fake leather. Our 2011 by comparison feels solid, no gear hunting, not a squeak or rattle, nice ride, real perforated leather and great JBL sound. We have owned many fine Toyotas including our current Rav and 2009 Camry Hybrid but I think corporate greed has caused their quality to decline in recent years including far too many recalls some of which years later STILL don't have a fix which speaks volumes right there."

2016-03-04 00:00:00,,"I gave my reliable 10 year old Lexus ES330 to my son & bought the 2015 Rav 4. I have been driving my Rav 4 for almost a year now  and so far reliability has been great, it's what I would expect from Toyota. 

I chose the 2015 Rav 4 over the Honda CR-V for the Rav 4's exterior styling although the CR-V that I saw at the Honda dealership had a nicer interior. 

I must say I am quite dissapointed with the 2015 Rav 4's rough ride and engine noise in city-suburban driving but highway driving is a lot smoother and quieter. I am getting around 20-21mpg in suburban driving, and around 25mpg on the so-called real life highway driving with most of the time just me and my wife in the vehicle. 

City Toyota Dealership Service Department in Daly City, California is fine, but it is not the top notch, luxurious and quiet Lexus Service Department that I had gotten used to. 
 
Overall I am pretty satisfied with my purchase of the 2015 Rav 4 but I must say I cannot get used to the 2015 Rav 4's rough ride in suburban driving."

Worst bluetooh on the market! 02/06/16 Up date Still the worst bluetooth on the market! Nissan has Toyota beat 10 to 1 on theirs.You Can get in the car and take off and if the does not pair right you can't even use your cell phone. Have to stop and shut it down get out of the car to make a phone call! Not just the rav4 my wifes 2013 camry does the same thing on her bluetooth! come on toyota your letting Nissan beat you on this bluetooth deal! Your better than that!"
2016-01-30 00:00:00,,"After owning several Highlanders, all of which were great vehicles, I traded in a Sienna XLE van for a 2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE, silver in color, with a two tone black/gray fabric interior.  I have made two trips from Long Island to Rochester, and I am happy with the seat comfort, and how the trucklet handles on the highway. The ride is firm, but not bad for a short wheel base suv, and the steering is superb. It doesn't wander around on the highway. It goes where its pointed without drama, and steering effort is good while giving nice road feel. All the instrumentation is pretty intuitive. My phone paired easily to the Bluetooth, and works well with the in dash controls. With the 2nd seat folded, there is a lot of cargo room, which I have used to good advantage. The 2.5 176 hp 4 cylinder cruises easily, and I keep it between 67 and 72 mph with little effort from the engine. I had reservations about a 4 cylinder, after having many V-6 Toyotas, with around 270hp, but the RAV4 power is sufficient, if not overwhelming. You just have to time your passes a little more carefully. A little disappointed in the mpg, which turns out to be around 24, only about 2 to 3 more than the much heavier Sienna. I specifically did not want a CVT transmission, and the RAV4 delivers with a conventional, very smooth 6 speed automatic. I also considered a Subaru Forester, which I test drove, and has a nice exterior, and comfortable, well designed interior, but did not like the CVT, and did not like how it moved around on the road, unable to hold a straight line without constant little adjustments. I did not test the Mazda CX-5 or the Hyundai Tucson. I drove the Honda CRV, very nice vehicle, but did not want a CVT transmission. That said, I was disappointed that the XLE does not come with a power driver's seat or even synthetic leather. The Sienna XLE had both. I believe every vehicle is a compromise on some points, and I got the RAV4 because its been in production for years, and has great reliability. So far I'm not disappointed."

2015-12-30 00:00:00,,"I took my beloved 2006 RAV in for its 120,000 mile maintenance. and drove a new 2015 Rav 4 for the day.

I first noticed unfortunate design changes while attempting to get in the car. The seat was higher. The roof lower, and the steering wheel moved less. Anyone over 6 feet tall will not be comfortable getting in and out of the drivers seat of the '15 Rav 4.  That's a shame because the ample headroom and easy entry was one of the reasons I bought the '06 Rav 4.

Visibility from the drivers seat , which wasn't ideal in my 2006 Rav4,  was even further from ideal in the '15. The ribbon windows in my '06 model have become mere  slits in the '15. No backup camera is  a risky thing in the Rav 4; I had one installed after reportedly backing into objects hidden from view.  The '15 has even less view of what is behind it.

Clearly, tiny fashionistas with an obsession with squinty windows and headlights have taken control of design and the car suffers from it.

The only improvement I detected was a decrease in road noise."
2015-12-24 00:00:00,,"I just purchased the 2015 Rav4 LE.  I had a 2012.  After driving it a few days I'm missing my older Rav4.  
For starters the daytime running lights no longer exist.  When I use the headlights there is no small light on my dashboard to tell me my lights are on.  And my headlights do not automatically go off when I park my vehicle, the way the 2012 did.
The windshield wipers do not have that interment option anymore either.  
The console area has less compartments than the 2012 also.  
I'm just very disappointed that Toyota would take away these small options.  They make a big difference.
I did read reviews that there is less space in the 2015 Rav 4 and that is true.  But I was expecting that.Performance4 out of 5 starsInterior1 out of 5 starsComfort4 out of 5 stars"
2015-12-04 00:00:00,,"Shopped for a variety of vehicles that could be an answer to a variety of situations. The RAV4 checks all the boxes.  Oil consumption issues deleted the Subaru Forester from my list; the Crosstrek was a strong contender but the lack of room deleted it from my list as well. Vibration issues with the new Honda CR-V crossed itself off my list.  The Subaru Outback had a strong lead, but something in my gut said no.  The RAV4 meets most of my criteria. It's a sharp vehicle and Toyota has done its homework in tweaking aerodynamic features to maximize efficiency (vortex generators, anyone?).  I came out of a Nissan XTerra, which I loved but was killing me on ergonomics, and was a poor carpooling choice.  The RAV4 has a huge rear seat, room to drop the seats and sleep in this vehicle, good cargo carrying capacity, an AWD button that turns all four wheels up to 25mph on demand, a traditional 6spd transmission, great fuel economy (averaging 27mpg mixed, but I did replace the standard air filter with a K&N filter), revised IIHS crash test scoring, expected resale value, and (let's hope) Toyota reliability made me land on the RAV4.  The Limited is a rough rider, but 18"" wheels and a taut suspension are the reason.  The sport button adds life to this machine, and the eco button drains any pep - nice to know those features are there, though.  The navigation screen is dismal (best in class for navigation goes to Ford and its SYNC system - miss my C-Max, too!) Stop griping about the lack of a place to store your sunglasses - if that's all you have to complain about, life is pretty good."
2015-11-26 00:00:00,,"Love this compact SUV!  Great exterior styling, quiet ride, maximum storage in its class, wonderful back seat leg room, a navigation/audio package upgrade at a great price point, and end-of-year closeout prices that were eye-popping.   And oh yeah... that Barcelona Red got my adult kids' attention.  It's a great looking ride!  With Toyota's reliability and celebrated resale values, this purchase was one I was looking forward to for some time."

2015-11-06 00:00:00,,"I bought a new 2015 RAV4 in February. Have had issues from the start. Door locks worked intermittently, often I couldn't get back into my car - big safety issue! Took it into the service dept FOUR TIMES before they finally figured out the problem. This after my complaints being met with either disbelief or being told that I ""must be pressing the wrong button."" (Huh??) One of the times, they simply let it sit in the service bay for an hour and a half, then told me they had checked it out and everything was now working fine. (yeah, right.) Turned out it was the actuator in the front drivers door that was defective. (Had no idea what an actuator even was until then.) Since then, I've had 2 other ""factory defects"" - so far! It looks great, drives great, rides comfortably, but... I will never buy another Toyota!!!!"
2015-11-01 00:00:00,,"I got this 3 three weeks ago and its been great so far.  The engine in smooth and quiet.  The eco, normal and sport mode works great you can feel the throttle change dynamics.  I use the econ most of the time on city driving to save fuel and sport if I want to do passing maneuvers.  The steering is how a toyota drives.
The suspension is on the firm side but great on the freeway with very little body roll.  The cabin is quiet.  Drove from vegas to LA and back and averaged 28.  I got 25 on mostly city driving.  The navigation is great but  voice command could be better, sometimes it does not pick up what you are telling it to do.  The only missing here is adaptive cruise, forward collision mitigation and a dual chrome exhaust that I wished toyota should have added here."
2015-10-08 00:00:00,,"Bought it in Sept 2015, and it was the worst decision I ever made. The interior is very cheaply made.  It has one of the worst factory stereos I have ever seen. The speaker sound goes up and down by its self, it sounds as if I put a blanket over the speakers. The nav system is just as bad. When on the phone through bluetooth it also fades in and out and the person on the other end of the phone has problems hearing. The blind spot is not good, it needs to sound an alarm when wanting to change lanes, just some little flashing lights are not enough. The LDA (lane departure alarm) system is just stupid. If you are drifting out of your lane the car should push you back not just sound an alarm. There are a lot of other things ( way too many to list) wrong with this car. For just over $30K it should be a much better car. We bought my husbands car a 2015 Chrysler 200 for about the same price and his is by far a better car for the price. I will never buy Toyota again."
2015-10-02 00:00:00,,"I'm having a problem that rain and snow gather in the hood channels and the spray the windshield.  It temporarily restricts visibility.

Also the Bluetooth is hit or miss.  Sometimes it connects and I can make calls.  Other times it stops and starts the call several times before connecting."
2015-09-14 00:00:00,,Am I the only one who has a problem with the headlights? I can't see the road with the low beam headlights on. It's really dangerous. Complained to the dealer and they didn't want to hear it.
2015-09-05 00:00:00,,"Looking for safety features, Roof Bluetooth AWD XM no blind spots simple to drive with plenty of pep and almost 30 miles to the gallon on the highway nothing comes close to the RAV4 and for the price it's a steal trust me and it had plenty of storage space with the cargo cover factory tiny is amazing for visibility"
2015-08-17 00:00:00,,"This is an addition to my earlier review tiled ""2000 Mile Review"" shortly after I wrote my review, I continued to improve the MPG of the RAV4.  I reached 29.9 MPG and was about to take my first trip in it.  I immediately got 30 mpg as I entered the expressway, which meant I was at the cusp of getting there.  I suggest another decimal point be added to the instrumentation.  After 4 hours of driving I was at 30.1.  I ended the whole trip at 30.2 MPG average which I think is great!  The dealer originally told me I should get 24-25 MPG.  The visibility all around is great.  The seats are great because my legs did not go numb or feel any tingling in them like some vehicles I owned in the past.  Cargo space was great.  There was very little noise the entire way.  Acceleration was adequate.  I love the cruise control.  I can do all the highway driving with that and not have to use the gas pedal for hours. The vehicle does let me know if I am straying out of my lane just because it is that sensitive.  Most vehicles I cannot feel it if I am going out of my lane.  I also climbed several dirt hills to take a short cut and the RAV4 did just fine.  Overall I am still very happy with the purchase."
2017-04-16 00:00:00,,"We purchased our brand new RAV4 in December 2017.  We have not had any problems with the car.  We maintain regular service visits (oil change, fluids topped off), in fact, the tires on the car are in excellent condition.  This is one of the best cars my family has ever purchased.  It still rides great, and is safe, and reliable.  

I did small SUV research and comparison before I purchased the Rav4.  It's one of the best cars I have ever owned...and I have owned a few but I am sold on Toyota's ability to imagine and to have captured what drivers want in a small SUV.  The safety features are standard, the design, ride, comfort, and style are excellent.  Toyota has built a car for my family, and I believe it will not be the only Toyota I will buy.  It's an excellent car and provides me with peace of mind.  Thank you Toyota...keep producing quality cars, at reasonable prices!"

2020-02-25 00:00:00,,"I purchased a 2016 RAV4 XLE with 22,000 miles on it in Aug. of 2019.  It replaces a 2002 Camry with 220,000 miles.  I wanted something a bit larger and more versatile, but not so large that it was difficult to park on city streets.  I also considered a Honda CRV, and a Mazda Cx-5. the Mazda seemed smaller, especially in the rear seat.  The Honda is just ugly, and I was concerned about the unresolved shaking issues.  In the end, our previous two Toyotas have been so trouble free that we decided to once again go with a Toyota.  It has exceeded my expectations.  I've taken it 800 miles on vacation, I've moved dining room furniture, and I've paralleled parked it in the city.  I am very pleased.  I didn't purchase a new one because of purported transmission issues, the new design, and cost.  I can not bring myself to spend more than $25,000 on a vehicle.  I wanted a Limited because of the seats...it is not so much that I wanted the fake leather, as that I dislike the current fabric being used.  It is unattractive, and looks very synthetic.  I am getting better gas mileage than I expected, especially since I have it mostly in ""Sport"" mode,  and the ride is better than expected.  My only hesitation in purchasing another Toyota was their reputation for ""boring"" handling.  I like it more, each time I drive it.  I find the storage in terms of door pockets, and cup holes, more than adequate.  I am very happy with my choice.  I should add that I am fine with the navigation and safety system..but I do not bother with the bluetooth...I don't want to talk on the phone while I drive...I am too easily distracted."

The seats are comfortable and room for 5 adults my size, (which is not small), great handling and all the technology I need in a car.  The side spot mirrors are great as I did not like the idea of flashing lights and buzzers ever time a vehicle came near the car.  Mileage is great, get about 31 to 32 MPG!  Really a fun and super car to own.  Owned for 3 years now, Still as enthusiastic about the vehicle as I was when I bought it!!!"
2017-11-30 00:00:00,,"This is our 2nd 4th-gen RAV4.  I had a 2013 which I sold after one year.  We purchased a 2016 Limited for my wife because she liked the looks and safety features.  The RAV is the probably the most disappointing car we have ever owned.  It is great on paper, but real life experience falls short of expectations.  Biggest issues are: 1) Very harsh / stiff ride.  Even small road imperfections translate into sharp, jarring bumps.  2) Uncomfortable seats.  Front seats are tiny and badly shaped.  I'm 5'7, 155 lb, and even being average-sized I feel like sitting on a chair designed for a child or a midget.  Rear seats aren't any better - flat and hard, like a wooden bench.  3) Noise.  Toyota improved the engine noise issue (which was terrible in the 2013 model), but road noise is still very bad.  I can hear every car around me - it's like riding with open windows.  Interior materials feel cheap.  Overall, the RAV feels like riding in a cheap $15k sub-compact, not a $30k SUV.  Very disappointing, and probably the last Toyota we will buy (after 5 other).  NOT RECOMMENDED.

UPDATED:
Now, after 5 years of ownership, here is my list of additional issues with the RAV4:
- Cheap materials and construction.  The interior rattles and squeaks like a cheap 1980 subcompact
- And last but not least - unreliable.  Mine started dripping oil from the front differential area 2 years after purchase.  Fixed by the dealer under warranty it held for 3 years.  1 month before warranty expired it started leaking again.  It took 4 repair trips and over 20 days in the shop, a new transfer case and a new transmission to finally correct a small oil leak.  Toyota covered it under powertrain warranty, but it it happened 1 month later I would be out of $8k in repairs.  Toyota customer service was terrible, it took them days to decide what to do, they nickeled-and-dimed the whole process.  The ""case manager"" was rude and unhelpful.

Bottom line - I am STRONGLY warning against buying a 4th generation (2013-2019) RAV4. Overpriced, cheaply made and unreliable.  Stay away."
2021-02-09 00:00:00,,"Bought used with 28,000 miles on her I have had this suv for almost 2yrs now the only thing that went was we needed to replace brakes all the way around and the rear brakes has extra brake pads for the E brake .
We love this suv easy to drive long distance with comfortable seating.handles well in the snow ."
2016-04-25 00:00:00,,"We have had the car for less than 1 month. Initially the dealership did not detail the car properly upon delivery. They made up for it a few days later. We did run into a problem with the Sirius XM. Sirius XM reset the programming 3 times. It did not fix the problem of sound cutting in and out. We will be taking the car to the dealer in a few days to examine the problem.

After seven months time...we find that the car's Blue Tooth system is not completely compatible with my wife's phone (a Motorola Droid Maxx II). The Blue Tooth connection is not reinstated each time my wife enters the car. She must do this manually. It is a small thing, but paying for all of this technology and having to 'hassle' between Toyota and Verizon and THEN find that Toyota says ""sorry, they are not compatible""....gives me negative vibes. Why not investigate this stuff when you bring the product to market????  And if investigation WAS done, why not advise the customer????"
2020-10-20 00:00:00,,"Toyota states a 24 City / 30 Highway MPG ratings. But those numbers are VERY optimistic, I drive very economically conscious not going over 2,000 RPM and I’m averaging only 22 on the Highway and 18-19 in the city, in a good day. Maintenance is kept up to date and tires properly inflated. I don’t understand where Toyota got this MPG numbers from.

Also, the driver seat is near impossible to get comfortable in, for both my wife or I (we just end driving our other car when driving together on the weekend for comfort). The rear suspension is quite stiff and noisy for a crossover SUV. In addition, their is no speed readout or tire psi (although it has TPMS) readout on the screen, unlike most other Toyota’s of the same year.

I’ll keep it due to Toyota’s reliability, but it’s not a great driving experience or MPG friendly."

2020-09-07 00:00:00,,"With Toyotas, you generally know what you’re going to get: a reliable ride.  It definitely has held true so far for my 2016 RAV4.  After 4 years and 40k miles, I have no complaints whatsoever so far."
2016-08-09 00:00:00,,"This is a well engineered vehicle. Very comfortable seats, very quiet in the cabin. Birds eye camera and saftey features ie. blind spot and lane sensing are fantastic.  The only things I would like to see added is a power passenger seat and a light in the cargo area.  Buying  the Hybrid was a no brainer...I think it was only around $700 more than the gas model.   Checked my mileage this last refill and it was 33.95 mpg.  The computer read out indicated 35.1 so very close to actual."
2016-06-17 00:00:00,,"I have had this car a month today and it just reached 1,000 miles and I am overall very happy with it.  The acceleration is great especially since I just traded in a 2005 Toyota highlander with a V6 figuring that I would have some adjustments to make.  The interior is overall spacious and comfortable but yet it does feel a bit cheap.   The carpet in the floor board  is very thin and the interior is a bit too much plastic looking.  I would imagine over time with a family  it may start to look a bit banged up but it is just me so hardly anyone will ever sit in the back seat.  The rims are nice and sporting looking but are plastic and I wonder how they will hold up especially since I keep a car for a long time.   A bad safety feature is when you put the it in  park all doors seem to unlock instead of just drivers door.  Over all do recommend for sporty styling and comfortable ride.

Update 12/16/16 Still enjoying this vehicle However I did discover  that the car doors can be programmed so that only the driver's door unlocks when you put the vehicle in park.

Update as of 6-17-18 I currently have 18,100 on my Toyota and it has been great my only complaint is the black interior it shows dirt quite well and the glare off the dashboard in the summertime can be quite hot to say the least.   Apparently I recently discovered a lot have RAV4's have black interior and unless you purchase a top of the line model it is hard to get another color interior.

Update as of 6-18-19 I currently have 26,500 on my Toyota and still enjoying it.  I put weathertech mats in the front this past year with all the bad weather we had this past winter.  Still complaint again is the black interior again shows dirt well and hot in the summertime with glare off of dashboard.

Update 12-18-19 Just replaced the tires at 31,291 miles which despite regular rotations the Michelin tires (factory issued) on the car they would of not lasted me through the winter.  Looked the tires up and technically they were supposed to last until 55,000 but there was not way they would have made it.   Since the new tires went on I have been having problems with the tire pressure light coming on constantly despite the fact that tires have the recommended amount of air needed.  I was told it was due to the cold and yes it does go off once the day warms up however I did not have this problem before now.    Next time I go to the dealership for oil change going to get it checked out.

I have 35,080 miles as of today 6/18/2020.  The tire pressure warning issue was due to the  business that put the new tires on did not put nitrogen in the tires they put regular air in which caused the pressure censor to not work correctly.  Still not too fond of the black interior and the plastic trim panels that run along side the bottom of the car are very difficult to keep clean and when you attempt to clean them as soon as it rains they are dirty again and look faded.  The Back to Black product that I have previously used is not only expensive but useless Turtlewax makes one that works a little better.   I am hoping to have my RAV4 professionally  
detailed soon.  Overall still very happy and almost paid for will be keeping this car."
2016-02-29 00:00:00,,"I bought a Rav4 with TSS-P. The pre-collision system with pedestrian detection does not work like advertised. Brought car back to dealership to check out system. Computer analysis diagnosed system in working order. Road test with Toyota adviser as driver proved a failure of this system. Dealerships answer was to turn to pages 240-241 of owners manual listing the limitations of the pre-collision system; that it may or may not work. Toyota headquarters USA told me that the pre-collision system only works in certain circumstances. I recommend you do not spend the money for the advanced tech package, until you road test your vehicle in these certain circumstances.  Update 8/29/16 After driving over 8,000 miles do not depend on the pre-collision system. It seems to respond when I set the speed control at higher speeds ,over 40 mph. do not depend on it not hitting a pedestrian.. Lane departure is more a warning than actually pulling you back into your lane. I am hoping the system improves in 3 years so I can trade this one. Update 09/01/2017 After 25,000 miles my review still stands. Rav 4 did not stop when pedestrian walked in front of vehicle..only beeps when object within 3 feet of vehicle. Very disappointed with Toyota Tech package. Update 03/03/2018 I traded the Rav 4 for a 2018 Subaru Forester with Eyesight works better. Traded my wife's 2016 Lexus with Tssp for a 2018 Subaru Legacy with Eyesight as well. Test drive at dealer proved Eyesight superior to Tssp. Legacy with Eyesight works in reverse and will not hit object when backing up. Only draw back is Subaru does not give loaner like Lexus. Update 03/05/2019 No problem with 2018 Subaru Forester. Problem with 2018 Subaru Legacy low gas warning and infotainment console, 7500 miles on odometer. Subaru offered to pay rental car for 6 weeks until repair console. Was going to trade in Legacy for 2019 Lexus GS, but TSSP still not superior to Eyesight. Called 1-800 Subaru and asked if 2019 Legacy had same problems as 2018 Legacy. Different console asked about trade, Subaru gave us $750 loyalty toward tradein. Went to dealer MSRP $32,810 dealer discount $29,675, trade-in $21,500 ...$8175 minus $750 loyalty $7425 plus tax fees and prep $9113.
   Love the advanced safety ""Eyesight"" on the Legacy and Forester. Traded the 2018 Forester for another 2020 Legacy."
2019-02-10 00:00:00,,Travel from Tennessee to Pennsylvania frequently. Put Michelin Ice/Snow tires on for winter. Best ice/snow vehicle I ever owned in 45 years of driving. AWD hybrid. Only down side is limited cargo space but did not purchase for this reason. Great winter vehicle.
2019-12-26 00:00:00,,"I bought my 2016 RAV4 SE brand new, drove it an average of 18,000 miles a year, it has been very reliable with no issues whatsoever. I like the car as it has plenty of room, handles well and very comfortable."
2019-12-09 00:00:00,,"I have the LE trim, with AWD.  That's part of the problem.  Seats are very, very uncomfortable with no lumbar support.  By far, the worst seats I've ever had the displeasure to park myself in, ever.  Interior of the car is cheap and plasticky, and is full of squeaks, rattles and groans.  Road noise is pronounced.  The brakes are terrible, as with the seats, the worst I've ever owned.  And, it hasn't been very reliable, okay, but certainly not legendary Toyota.  Note that this is my family's 9th Toyota, and it will be the last.  I paid that extra few thousand premium over the Honda, Mazda or Subaru, presumably for the reliability, and I've been very disappointed.  Next time, I'll buy a Mazda; my wife's Mazda has been way more reliable, is much more comfortable to drive, and was much greater value."
2019-12-03 00:00:00,,Love my new used Toyota Rav four.  Much better ride and exceleraction than expected.
2019-10-17 00:00:00,,Make sure you know exactly what kind a car you want
2016-07-26 00:00:00,,Beside it being a little tight for my 6ft 6in son it is a great car. It gets great gas milage and it is a great ride.  I know it will be in the family a good long time~♡~
2016-07-28 00:00:00,,"Over all the RAV4 is a great choice.  I love the way it looks and I don't get to a light and see 3 others sitting there with me.  It is quiet and comfortable to drive.  I have only owned it 2 1/2 years and this is what I have found.  The tech guys that did the instruments over did the MPG and MPH choices, there are 3. It tells you miles till empty and I am doubting the accuracy of that since I can only get a little over 12 gallons in when it says it is empty.  They could have had a electronic read out of current MPH.  I have the SE and that trim level does not have a compass built in or automatic head lights.  My old 2009 Escape had both.  I kind of expect that at that trim level I shouldn't have to pay $2500 to move to a Limited to get it.  It is comfortable for a person my size but if you were large either tall or in weights it would be tight.  I am not an aggressive driver and am getting 26-27 (summer), 22-24 (winter) MPG in the city 30-31 (summer), 27-29 (winter) MPG on the highway doing in the low 70's which is great."
2018-01-31 00:00:00,,"This car is not what I would call interesting, but it is very good at what it does. First, the interior of the base model is very good in my opinion. The front seats in this car are very comfortable they hug your sides even if you are of a more slender build. The leg room in the front seats is very good. I'm six feet tall, and there is still more room to move the seat back. The back seats have decent leg room as well, I would be comfortable riding in the back seats of this car for a long car trip. Storage in this car is also very good. I use this vehicle to carry music gear to all of my shows. I can fit a 4x8 bass cabinet, 2 guitar amps, 6 guitars, a six way guitar stand, a few effects pedals, mics and stands. With all of this there is still enough room to comfortably fit 3 people in the vehicle. 2 in the front, one in the 40 split in the back seat. The performance of this car is solid. I would not call this car fast, cause it's not, but the engine has plenty of power to merge on the highway, and move in and out of traffic. The steering on this car is also very good. It is light when making parking maneuvers, but tightens up when cornering more aggressively. I drove this car in the snow/ice this winter and it does fairly well. The traction control system is surprisingly good and getting the car to grip up in worse than ideal conditions.  Visibility in this car is good, The back window is harder to see out of then I would like, but the back up camera comes as standard in this vehicle, which is pretty useful. The mirrors are excellent with the blind spot mirrors in the corners, there is virtually no blind spot when adjusted correctly. The transmission is fairly good, but I honestly just don't like automatic transmissions coming from driving a 5 speed for 6 years before this car.  The Bluetooth in the car works very well for playing music I don't use it for much else. The text reading options kind of suck and the menus for the screens though logical take too many steps, but I'm driving a car so I usually don't mess with them any how. The steering wheel has a nice feel to it and the controls don't clutter it up too much. Fuel economy is good in this car. I usually get about 26 mpg when I fill up, that is usually mostly city driving and I tend to be a faster driver in general so I think that is pretty good. As for the quality of the interior, I would say it is good, I have black cloth seats, and they look nice, and the fabric breathes quite well, so even in hot Kentucky summers the car isn't unbearably warm. No mechanical issues with this car so far, it was a rental car that had 42k miles on it when I bought it so I figured it lived a tough life before I got it, but seems to have suffered no damage during that time. This vehicle is very easy to change the oil on if you were wondering. Everything is located underneath towards the front and with the large amount of ground clearance I can change the oil without putting it on jacks."
2018-07-29 00:00:00,,"Very enjoyable SE model -- Black on black outstanding color and appearance.  Not a sports car, but just reliable and fun to drive...."
2016-07-21 00:00:00,,It's a decent vehicle for the price. Toyota is a good brand. Its been 3 years now since I’ve purchased and the fabric on the interior door panels Are coming undone. It’s like bubbling off the adhesive is failing. Only other thing would be the hood. It gets a lot of abuse from rocks the paint chips too easy when driving highways.
2019-06-25 00:00:00,,"Not exceptionally large, perfect for small family"
2019-06-22 00:00:00,,My only complaint is the screen on the dash.  The way it is angled it is not visible when the sun shines in on it.
2019-05-12 00:00:00,,"I'm writing this review of my 2016 RAV4 SE nearly three years after purchasing the car... I did my online research just like we all do, but I went a step beyond and test drove a good number of SUVs in the class... Nissan, Ford, Kia, Subaru, Honda, Hyundai... Toyota was the clear winner for energy, acceleration and handling as well as the classy interior and magnificent safety package (an add-on that I would highly recommend). The 7"" touchscreen is decent--although annoying when it refuses to let your scroll based on ""safety,"" never asking if a passenger might be trying to access the info... It's also unfortunate that apple carplay is not available in the 2016 RAV4... Toyota was very protective of its middle-class Entune proprietary system... In current model years, it gave into the Apple devil... but a software update is not an option for 2016. That said, Bluetooth works just fine... This is a hell of a FINE AUTOMOBILE... it's badass in appearance and has been exceptional in terms of reliability. I'm SOLD... won't be trading this handsome devil in for a good long time. Hope that's helpful!"
2019-04-17 00:00:00,,"Leased this vehicle for 3 years. Immediately with the first snow, when I would step on the brake, the car would veer going to the left onto incoming traffic and I couldn't stop it. Kept taking it back to Toyota but they said they couldn't find anything. Finally after about 20K, we found that it need routers and brake pads.  Replaced them with non-toyota brake system and the issue went away. Getting ready to lease another toyota and praying that it doesn't do the same thing. Very scary moments."

2019-03-05 00:00:00,,"I really liked the safety features and interior design of my leased 2016 Rav-4. Also I loved the bright blue color, too. The navigation was terrible, Bluetooth only worked half the time, Toyota refuses to uphold the warranty clearly outlined in the lease agreement. All in all, I enjoyed the car, but after the warranty issue, I’ll probably never own/lease a Toyota again."
2019-02-23 00:00:00,,"I own a RAV4 SE AWD and this is my first review since buying it almost 3 years ago.  This has been a fantastic SUV and if you are seriously considering this model you are making a good choice.  It handles very well and the engine is quiet as compared to the new RAV4 (I recently test drove the Limited FWD).  I prefer the interior in this generation as well because the infotainment screen is built into the dashboard.  I have very little to complain about - only the driver's seat is electric, so it would be better if the passenger's was as well.  ZERO MAINTENANCE ISSUES SO FAR - I will be keeping this RAV4 for a long time..."
2018-08-03 00:00:00,,My 2016 XLE is a very nice riding car with plenty of room. I wish it had come with a CD player. The transmission is lousy in ECO mode. The car is alwaways shifting and doesn’t know what gear it wants to be in. It works fine in sport mode but you have to manually put it in sport mode every time you start it. Themilage is just ok. It should be better. I average 18 to 23 miles per gallon and I am not a fast driver and do not do jack rabbit starts.
2019-01-24 00:00:00,,Love the Rav4! currently leasing but probably going to buy it cause is such a good car.
2019-01-15 00:00:00,,"I love this car, don't get me wrong, but I wish it had more! I would love to see park assist in this model as well as an indication of how many miles until empty."

2016-04-22 00:00:00,,"What had happen to Toyota? The quality is not there any longer... We own the car only for a month and had the whole headliner replaced as it was not correctly installed in the factory. Now the car makes whining sound and Toyota service is not very helpful to resolve the issue.

I also want to mention that the base trim is bare bones and the headlight control is awful. 

Update. The transmission was replaced and complementary extended warranty was provided. The whining noise is still there but it is not as bad as with the original transmission. We are still very disappointed with Toyota."

2018-08-18 00:00:00,,My second Rav. Would definitely recommend.
2016-08-01 00:00:00,,"Had been driving large crossovers for many years.  Kids and grandkids grown or moved away.  Knew that Toyota and Honda both have great reliability ratings, so drove both.  For my wife and I, Toyota beat Honda in most all categories, except possibly gas mileage.  Honda seats very uncomfortable, lots of wind noise and a very rough ride. Settled on Toyota  Rav4 over Honda CRV.  Little worried about new softex  seating material in Toyota, did some research and everything was positive.  Found that Mercedes us almost same (Different named) material in their cars. So far, everything is going great, my wife has more high tech equipment on this car than in her much higher dollar crossover. Haven't had the car long enough yet to comment on mileage, etc.  Will update after 6 mos. Seriously doubt if there will be anything negative to report."

2018-07-11 00:00:00,,"Do not waste money on their navigation system, its absolutely useless! The sound system is not that great either, voice recognition sucks, usb recogntion sucks. Can not make adjustments while car is in motion, no passenger option....way ...way behind on what other auto makers are offering."
2024-02-13 00:00:00,,"I bought my 2017 RAV4 XLE AWD brand new in Spring 2017 and it has been a companion to my wife, our dogs, and I for the last 7 years. Sadly, my wife and I decided to trade the amazing RAV4 in today for something bigger (another Toyota mind you), but that was no reflection on the RAV4 whatsoever. In fact, it's an amazing vehicle all around!

After 162,000 I've never had a single mechanical problem with the RAV4. Outside regular maintenance, the engine, transmission,  and everything else has worked flawlessly. We drove thr car from coast to coast, and all over the place over the years (hence the high miles). Still, despite the flawless reliability, the car isn't perfect, although none of the following are enough to warrant one less star in my review. Here are a few minor issues we had in our long term ownership with the RAV4.

Headlight bulbs burned out often: I don't know if this is an electrical issue or what, but I was replacing the headlight bulbs every 12-16 months. Luckily they're easy to replace, but still annoying.

Infotainment is glitchy and temperamental: the infotainment unit is fairly glitchy and would often not show the song playing, or freeze on one song as new ones came up. It also did not play nicely with my old iPod when I still had it and also USB thumb drives with music on it. There were a few times where everything froze for no apparent reason and I literally had to turn the car off and start it back up to resolve. Luckily that didn't happen often, but overall I was not impressed with the infotainment system.

Front seats lost support after a while: this wasn't an issue until the last couple years of ownership, but the front seats, especially the drivers seat got less and less supportive with time. It was bad enough where on longer car trips my lower back, butt, and legs would get very stiff and painful. I never had this issue the first 4 or so years, but I figured it was worth noting if you plan on looking at higher mileage examples. 

Other than those very minor gripes, the 2017 RAV4 is as reliable and well built a vehicle as anyone would hope. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable car and one they can depend on for a very, very long time."
2024-02-11 00:00:00,,"I bought this car from dealer with 34,000 miles at fair market value. Very clean. Looks brand new. Received 4,000 mile dealer warrantee. Ample interior space with plenty of power for 4 cylinder car. A little too manny  bells and whistles for  me though. Front brake pads at 2mm. needed replacing at dealership no charge. All told this is a good car reasonably priced.  RMC"
2017-12-08 00:00:00,,"Do your home work on reviews of other types of SUV's in this class, and talk with owners when you see them in the public places. believe me you will not be disappointed! Going on 3 years now of ownership with 25,000 miles can not say enough about how much I love this vehicle. The only problem I have is the black color interior makes it hard to see the instrumentation, mainly because I'm blind in one eye. But all else makes up for that!"
2022-11-28 00:00:00,,"This is my first Toyota and I must say that I am impressed. I've always bought Nissn but wanted to try something different. It  rides nice and it had almost everything I wanted ( I wanted a remote tailgate). Other than that, I am satisfied with it."
2023-09-18 00:00:00,,"I have my 2017 Rav 4 for three years now ,two issues I have is number one ,It just shuts down unexpectedly , on the highway or driving around town etc. Took it to the dealer, they checked it in their words""From stem to stern"" reset computer, worked fine for a few months then problem comes back, If I take positive cable off the battery, and leave off for awhile it ,the problem goes away for a number of days than returns. Called Toyota I was told that they never heard of this problem before, which I doubt. 2Nd issue is minor when driving in the dark some of the instrument panel buttons dont  lght up. Have to try and remember where they are. Otherwise I like everything else about the vehicle my type of vehicle."
2018-09-01 00:00:00,,"Have owned the “Recreational All -Terrain Vehicle “  since March of 2017. Still fun to drive! Has impressive safety features with a quiet ride! Only complaint is about the sound system including the blue tooth...the systems are very hard to use. Hopefully Toyota will ditch this system soon.  RAV4 ‘s have a fine history of being a reliable vehicle and we are so happy to keep on trucken  with our two year old Limited AWD #4 RAV. RAV is now 6 yrs old with 50000 miles. Have done just normal maintenance (oil, filters ETC). Car still rides and drive like a new one. Looks good & is vey dependable ( as we’re our 2000, 2003 & 2008 Limited RAV’s)."
2023-03-01 00:00:00,,"The suspension is the detail which impresses me, most. Hugs the road on sharp turns.  Excellent handling, nice interior technology. The 2023 model surely has more, in the tech department, but by 2017, Toyota had already included the 6 safety controls (beginning with Lexus) into the RAV4. I considered trading it in for a Mazda CX-7.  I like it too much, though. Keeping it longer."
2023-02-11 00:00:00,,Professional friendly salesman at a great dealership. This very low mileage vehicle in perfect condition and obviously had been garaged by the previous owner. Well maintained. Interior and exterior in new condition.

That's a factory QA issue , starter bolts, then alternator, it's going in for it's certified 1year  , I want drive train  checked good I really wanted to give my wife's newer certified Rav a better review,,Hope Toyota reads and learns from us owners, reason I gave up on a far worse brand Ford,   Thx Dale."

2017-05-04 00:00:00,,"(Update as of May, 2021 - I'd like to see Toyota provide better quality tires on their new entry-level vehicles such as their RAV4.  Our tires (all 4) are cracking near the rim and need to be replaced, with only 20,000 miles on them!)  We compared both the new 2017 Mazda CX-5 and the RAV4 and while both are excellent compact SUVs, my wife preferred the lower dashboard and simpler console of the RAV4, so that's how we went.   The new XLE version is so much quieter than our older 2011 RAV4 and has a much improved ride.  The Entune sound system is likewise deserving of high marks, and even though it doesn't have Apple Car Play, it works seamlessly with both Bluetooth and the lightning/USB connection for music, calls, etc.  Very impressive.   On the mechanical side, the RAV has real good pickup and has kept us in the 30-31 mpg range on our two highway trips thus far.  For an AWD vehicle that's not too shabby!   Overall we are extremely pleased with our purchase. Given Toyota's legendary reliability, we expect to enjoy the RAV4 for quite some time.   Lastly, the only improvements I would recommend for the XLE level would be:  an additional USB port either in the console or in the rear of the console,  the option for heated seats, and  a wider choice of cloth seat and dash colors.  Update - May 2020:  I would not change a thing in my review - still a great compact SUV! Update - December 2022:  No changes to the review.  Up to 26,000 miles now.  Do wish it had Apple Car Play."

2022-03-03 00:00:00,,It is a great car.  We have the platinum model.  It's a shame they stopped making that model.  We looked at a new RAV 4 yesterday and you really can't get everything we have one the new models.  Even if you buy their highest price vehicle it still does not match up to our RAV 4 so I am looking at other cars.  Such a shame!!
2021-12-28 00:00:00,,"Great safety features like line departure warning, or anti crash radar, solid car in general, but theres almost no storage in the front, since centrer console box is small, and doors have this small compartment. Not to mention that glove box opens suddenly on the go! Other than that, I'm very happy with the car performance and fuel consumption, its rear cargo area is good, and is exellent when folding back seats."
2016-12-12 00:00:00,,"You pay for what you get. Great quality for the price. You can pay less for an suv but you will not get the build, ride or satisfaction compared to other import brands. Most companies take something of quality out of there cars in order to get the lower price. Honda is a good example of   taking quality out but basically keeping the car the same with little improvement. They may seem different but there foxes with sheeps clothing. The manufacture says they have to break completely before they consider fixing it regardless if it has few miles or not. Toyota stands behind what they sell. Don't buy anything else, consider only leasing them if you don't want to be sorry."
2021-08-18 00:00:00,,"Great car for in and around the city and for short distances.  Nimble...gets in and out of places really easily.  The lane departure warning, danger warning and emergency situation braking is great.  Negatives: seats are not real leather and are hard, uncomfortable and not ergonomically well-designed resulting in neck and back pain on longer trips or frequent highway travel (limited seat adjustment positions); the cabin space is small and cramped for people 5'8"" (me) or taller; the car is noisy on the highway (poor insulation); the hands-free phone system is mediocre at best; rear-view visibility is poor (fixed on recent models); the car pops out of gear when using the lower gear options and hitting road bumps or depressions; no CarPlay capability (is on more recent models); the hybrid system battery may need to be replaced starting at around 100K miles and may cost around $5000+ to replace."

- Small fuel tank thus limited range is annoying.
- Slow lift gate."
2017-09-29 00:00:00,,"The only reason Toyota gets such high ratings is ""money"". The owners are afraid to complain because it may greatly reduce their bloated resale value. Plus the arrogant Toyota personnel ignore your complaints and deny that anything is wrong ""after all it is a Toyota"". They can take their Toyota and put it where the sun don't shine. Pure media mass manipulation. Specifically; Front vision is not good. hood is not designed well so it is almost impossible to judge distance from an object. Rear visibility is none existent. Getting into the car is a neck breaker, the front widow is at such a tight slope that you have to bend your neck over to almost touch  your shoulder or chest to get your head to fit below the top of the window. It is difficult to find the seat belt it is so flat against the center post and far away that its difficult to grasp it. It is difficult to try to hook up the seat belt because the space between the seat and the accessory is way to tight. Gas mileage is poor."
2018-09-22 00:00:00,,"This is ""Just a Car"", offering nothing to make it stand out.  We have owned this 2017 RAV4 for 13 months and have 8000 mi on it now.

Drives well, has only standard safety stuff, interior is not any more than average.  The longer we have it the less we like it.  Too many ""misses"" on what it offers.  Front seats are just average, carpet is cheep and everything sticks in the nap, visibility is not great out over the hood.  Washed the RAV yesterday and find that the aluminum wheels are not easy to clean.  Access to the spokes is limited.  We have 4 cars with aluminum wheels and RAV wheels are the toughest to clean.  Design team probably thought they looked cool, but did not think of maintenance required to clean.  Front seats have limited adjustments.  Driver seat launches you out if it is raised near its maximum.  Passenger seat is too low, only adjustment is fore/aft.  I want to sell now, wife will put up with it.  Review update, well we traded the 2017 Rav for a 2016 Highlander.  We will never go back!  Ya the Highlander is more expensive but it is a lot more car.  Missing the Driver assist features, but not enough to wish we had the RAV.  May consider to trade up to a 2017-2019 Highlander as it does have the Driver assist.  
Sure feel sorry for all of those people that purchased new RAV's when they could have a used Highlander for the same money.  Worth the difference to give up a few years when buying used.  But there are lots of Low mileage Highlanders out there."
2019-01-29 00:00:00,,"the car is great, driving around is ok but not that exciting plus i think it should include more usb ports cause there is only one in the front. is a little pricey but is a Toyota!"
2021-01-27 00:00:00,,"I bought the Limited model of Rav4 because it gave me many attributes I wanted such as floor mats, heated front seats, tinted windows, leather seats, and an attractive car! The Rav4 is a great size with room to carry plenty of items and is a smooth ride with AWD (All Wheel Drive).  This is the third one I have had and while I looked hard at other used cars I ended up staying with the RAV4 over other vehicles in the same class. It also good clearance from the ground so in snow, it travels well, and it is high enough above the road to be above any truck spray when I pass them in bad weather. It gets reasonable mileage at 23-28 MPG and Toyotas hold their resale value"
2017-07-03 00:00:00,,"Had the car now for 42 months. With Covid, not too many miles driven; up to 29,450 miles. Had my first major “purchase” this week. Had to replace the battery."
2017-12-28 00:00:00,,"We've driven several Camrys for the past 20 years and didn't know how quickly we would adjust to the RAV4.  But the transition has been quick and easy.  Our RAV4 moves easily into and out of traffic.  The instrument panel is convenient and easy to read.  The headlights do an amazing job illuminating the streets/highways on both bright and dim.   The ride isn't quite as comfortable as a Camry, but it's close enough that we have been surprised and pleased...our RAV4 is reasonably quiet and comfortable.  We are impressed with the many safety features of of RAV4.  If we had to make a car buying choice again we would definitely buy another RAV4."
2017-05-20 00:00:00,,"Great car with lots of options...Limited, AWD, with leather, blue tooth, nagi, memory seats, parking assist, hitch ETC. Lots of good safety items on car...that is what sold us on this...traded in 2008 RAV4 Limited with 72000 which had very little safety items (it was a great car with a V-6, AWD).  Toyota seems to be way ahead of the other auto companies when it comes to safety.  We also like the 4 cyl engine and it isn't much different from the 08 V-6 and it does it much better gas milage.
Car is a great driving machine...steering is outstanding, car corners well and it a pleasure to drive.  Style is beyond great...its cool and up to date. Love the hitch and I pull my trailer with yard stuff in it all the time.  Car is quiet and comfortable. Dec 2020 RAV has about 40,000 and new tires...it is even quieter now. Love the car, lots of power and drives nice. Use the hitch on it for the trailer lots of times...RAV is a wonderful vehicle. I like the body style much more then the plain Jane RAV that 
Toyota went to for 2020.   We plan on keeping our RAV for a least another 75000 miles. Nothing has gone wrong with it, interior, sound system, ETC all work great. On highway we get 30-32 miles per gallon...even using the ""sport"" button. Great car."
2020-11-20 00:00:00,,"Smooth, safe and comfortable ride!"
2020-06-25 00:00:00,,"Beautiful interior, big enough to lay comfortably for things like a drive-in movie theater, or to fit a dye table in the back. Bluetooth is a big attraction and the speakers are mad nice. Automatic brights and the car runs super smooth, besides the blue bird that was already hiding in my car when I got it I couldn’t ask for anything more."
2020-06-21 00:00:00,,"I did a test drive today with the Rav 4 and it handled very well! The console is great, the sun roof is cool, and I had a good ride."
2019-06-11 00:00:00,,This is a great SUV . Very comfortable ride . The Navigation logic can use a better logic. Its acceleration was better than i expected. The technology for Blind spot and dynamic cruise control is amazing .Makes long distance driving a pleasure since you dont have to break as often .. this technology allows you to keep up with traffic and eliminate stress while also creating a safe driving experience . Several times when someone cut in front of me -- the car just lowered the speed automatically .  There is no overhead light in the trunk part when you open the hatch back which is a problem & the automated lock/unlock buttons are not lit creates problems at night otherwise What an amazing vehicle!!
2020-03-07 00:00:00,,"I live in Australia, and have driven my Rav about 50,000 km. Generally, I like this car and find it reliable and safe to handle with plenty of space and comfort.
My 3 neatives are : 1) The listed fuel consumption of 8L /100 is totally unrealistic (I am told its achieved on a test bed)
2) It is listed as having a 60 litre tank, but the on-board computer only responds to 40 litres. I have been told by a Toyota Manager that when the computer display shows empty and the red light comes on, there are still 20 litres in the tank, (true but unprofessional).
3) The cruise control does not hold the ""set"" speed on slight down hills, but my wife's Mazda 2 changes gears to hold ""set"" speeds."
2020-02-07 00:00:00,,Very reliable.
2019-11-22 00:00:00,,"My Rav 4 Is the best car I have ever owned!   It is great in the snow for colorado, never slips, great clearence.  In the summer it goes fast on mountain roads great turning radius and safe!  Lots of room but still easy to parrell park , especially with the back up camera."
2019-10-31 00:00:00,,"Everything you could want in a mid-sized SUV.  I bought the car new to take advantage of all the latest safety features that my 2004 didn't have.  But, after 2 years, I found it painful to get in/out of this car because of my poor right-side knee and hip joints .  So, I traded in the 2017 RAV4 for a 2013 Lexus RX 450h that has more head and leg room up front; getting in/out.of the Lexus is MUCH easier and not painful at all for me --- and I still have all of the most important safety features that the RAV4 has.  Plus, my monthly payments are LOWER now than with the 2017 RAV4."
2018-10-03 00:00:00,,"This vehicle has been great in every area thus far. We have owned it 1 year and have driven it 12,000 miles. Gas mileage ranges between 28 and 31 mpg. The only complaint we have had is that the 17"" Continental tires that came with the vehicle beside being very poor quality are unsafe. The sidewall blew out on the right front while we were on the highway. Praise the Lord we did not have an accident . I went on line and checked Continental tire complaints and found out that we were one of many that have had the same experience. We had to purchase 4 new tires at 12,000 miles as the tread was also fairly low and yes the tire pressure had been checked on a regular basis and they were rotated as they should be. If Toyota wants to keep its good name they need to not worry so much about the bottom line and put quality tires on their vehicle to match the quality of their product. Toyota is not afraid to put a hefty price on their vehicles because they tout their quality, that should extend to tires also. Auto manufactures want top dollar and yet they put the cheapest tires they can find on their products. What is wrong with this picture?"
2019-09-22 00:00:00,,"I got a Toyota RAV4 at Findlay Toyota in Henderson, NV for my wife, 2 years ago. When the car had 12K miles it got a weird sound when she pushed the brakes. The service department said it was just dirt in the brake pads and that it would disappear with time. At 14K miles the sound remained, and the service department insisted it was dirt. At 19K miles the sound still was there and the service department said that was a problem with those cars, but the new ones didn't have the problem and that we have to replace the brakes at our own cost. This is unbelievable, they knew the car had that problem, but they just transfer the solution to the customer. We have to pay for their mistakes.
I called Toyota and spoke with a service manager and she just said there was nothing they could do and that if I was not satisfied I could write a bad review, which means they don't care, they just want your money and once they get it you are not their customer anymore.
30 years ago I lived in Colombia, South America, and I got a Toyota Hilux. The car also had problems with the brake system; when I had to stop real fast, the car started spinning (it made about two 360 degrees circles at 65 miles per hour). The story was the same, the customer service department said they didn't know anything about that problem and that I had to pay to solve it. Three years later that car got a recall due to that problem, and the solution  was to replace all the hydraulic hoses for bigger ones, but I already had done that out of my pocket. 
It seems to me Toyota still needs to learn how to do brake and needs more training for the service department. I would never buy a Toyota anymore."
2019-08-11 00:00:00,,"Bought our 2017 Rav4 LE new from the dealership right when it came to the lot now at 33k miles were starting to have transmission problems hard shift and sometimes want shift till 6k rpm also our braking system failed, worst purchase I ever made. It was nice at first seats are somewhat comfortable but dust and dirt collect very easy on it. radio needs some work headlights are horrible somewhat good on gas. Paint on em seems cheap after 6months of it we started to get chips in the paint.  I stay away from Toyota build quality has dropped drastically..."
2019-05-09 00:00:00,,2017 Rav 4 XLE AWD. Purchased new.  At 20000 mi the rotors had to be replaced due to a defect and at 23000 mi the AC motor blower went bad. Drivers side door lock quit working at the same time. Gas mileage not great. Last Toyota will buy....cant wait for the next thing to go wrong...

2019-03-05 00:00:00,,"Had a 2014 RAV4 which was great.  Was totaled, so bought a 2017 RAV4.  2017 RAV4 had some changes, like you had to download ""SCOUT"" navigation; the 2014 RAV4 had a great preload navigation system.  Did not care for the new navigation of SCOUT.     Bottom line I still like the RAV4."
2018-08-31 00:00:00,,"Great car but this model requires the use of Toyota's @#$@! scout gps link navigation system. google maps works much better and is easier. I was driving a Nissian Frontier PU with 4 wheel drive (I live in Buffalo, NY) changing to the Rav4 didn't affect my winters. It goes in the snow. I truly enjoy the Rav4's comfort and steering. I feel comfortable on highways and on city streets. It can also cart around an impressive amount with the seats folded down. the rear reclining seats are much appreciated."
2018-11-06 00:00:00,,"My wife was looking for an suv and we tried literally every suv in our price range and she picked the Toyota Rav4. The determining factor for her was the comfort and support of the drivers seat and the visability for the driver as she is height challenged. After trying most of the other makes of suv she fell in love with the looks and style of the Rav4. She loves the way it handles on the road and all of the safety features like the blindspot monitor, warning when you change lanes without signaling or drift out of your lane, and the feature that warns you when vehicles in front of you are getting to close. So far she has not seen any thing she does't like in the car and with Toyota's legendary dependablity we should have this vehicle for many years.."
2018-10-18 00:00:00,,This car is a super car for the money and is very dependable.
2018-10-17 00:00:00,,"Great style, safety features, cargo volume, and good miles per gallon on trips."
2018-03-26 00:00:00,,"Not sure if it is the Bridgestone tires or just the lack of good quality insulation but at highway speeds you can really hear the road. Otherwise in the 6 months of ownership I feel it is a great little SUV. You read the Car Magazines knocking the power but I find this 2.5 4 Cyl does a nice job of acceleration from a stop or getting on the highway.  My prior vehicle was a 3.0 ltr. Honda and it was a rocket ship but I am impressed with acceleration on this 2017 RAV4 Limited. 
I would and have recommended this vehicle as one to purchase."
2019-07-25 00:00:00,,"Can't go wrong with any Toyota, but my Rav 4 is just perfect for me. Puttin around town will drop your M.P.G. but on a vacation run of about 800 miles we got appx. 38 M.P.G. this was 2 people and using the Economy Mode. One thing (and it's minor) was that my model XLE did not come with LED driving lites. there on the vehicle as a decoration. Toyota safety is at the fore front. but they struck out with this miss."
2023-01-21 00:00:00,,"I bought this car used but with low mileage two years ago.  The car is dependable, low cost maintenance, decent mileage and is an attractive vehicle.  The problem I noticed right away is the interior noise.  It's as if Toyota did nothing to soundproof the cabin.  I would have appreciated  a little more shoulder and leg room.  The car has decent acceleration and is very good on ice and snow.

Mostly what the RAV4 lacks is pizzaz.  When it first came on the scene it had pizzaz, it had a presence, a unique style. You'd look at the car and want to drive it.  None of that is true with the 2018 model.

I'm sure that it will run forever as many Toyotas do, but it won't be any more exciting then than it is now, and that's unfortunate."
2024-01-21 00:00:00,,"Comfortable ride and car has not broken down on me. But… Toyota went overboard with beeping safety warning features. This car made for a novice driver. Also, the AWD only comes on when you push the button and only works up to 25 mph. When AWD is activated, its hardly noticeable… Joke. 
Not safe to drive in snow or icy conditions. 
Front breaks squeal and Lately, battery is trying to die"
2023-01-08 00:00:00,,"I wish I had bought the hybrid, but otherwise reliable and comfortable at a very reasonable cost. I have had absolutely no issues."
2023-10-03 00:00:00,,Excellent comfort and pick up with a 4 cyc engine. Handles well at high speeds. Back up camera is a big plus. I have no negative things to say. This is my everyday rider and this is my 6th RAV4.
2023-08-17 00:00:00,,Suvs are really unlike regular cars to drive but  once you get use to them they are the most fun.
2023-05-15 00:00:00,,"I have a 2018 Rav 4 XLE and this is my 3rd one! I love it.  Driver's seat is comfy and cozy, steering isn't too loose feeling, the interior suits me perfectly, not totalitarian at all IMO.  As for the ride, the cabin isn't as quiet as other SUVs but having better tires than what comes with the Rav makes a HUGE difference.  Handles well on sharp turns, wet and icy pavements.  I just wish the newer Sport came with automatic start.  I have less than 50k miles, original owner and I am not done with it yet."
2023-01-12 00:00:00,,My experience with this is perfect. I like it very much eventhough it does not have a  GPS .
2022-10-27 00:00:00,,"After owning 2 Highlanders, and doing all the maintenance myself (both cars lasted over 290,000 miles with basic maintenance) I decided to downsize and pick up a newer model Rav4. After talking to several mechanics, they had very positive things to say about the 2018 model year. It's the last year Toyota included the rock-soild 8 speed automatic transmissions before they switched to CVTs in the next model year. That amazing 8-speed automatic coupled with the really reliable 2.5L engine means you'll be trading slightly worse MPGs than other SUVs of time, but you do get the power, solid shifting, and immediate response in return, just an incredible pairing. The interior isn't flashy, or extremely comfortable, but it is well built and made with some robust materials. Just passing 75k on the odometer, drives like new with basic maintenance!"
2022-09-11 00:00:00,,"Smooth ride, high beams not high, seat too low, just ok screen, infotainment system lacking, needs upgrades, good luggage space, warning beeps too low to hear over traffic."
2022-09-03 00:00:00,,"My 5 year lease on our 2018 RAV4 XLE Hybrid with only 40,000 kms on it comes up next spring.  I was into the dealership to look at our options.  When he calculated the blue book value of mine in front of me, it came in only $2000 less than what it was listed at in 2018.
Combine that with spending $80-$100 a month less on gas than I would have with a non-hybrid, I'm actually gaining on this investment, which for any kind of new car ownership is usually impossible.
I will most certainly buy out the vehicle when the lease is up, as we have been completely happy with it's performance and comfort.  It also has 20hp more than a non hybrid."
2022-09-01 00:00:00,,"I went back to a low mileage 2018 Rav4, from a 2021 Rav 4. Yes it is a tiny bit smaller, but I find the ergonomics of the controls, seating, sun roof, and tail door lift much more friendly for myself."
2018-08-13 00:00:00,,"I just got through completing my sale of a wrap for last night. I paid $21,781 drive out for an LE model. I shopped almost every dealership in Houston and the average price they were quoted me drive out was in the range of 24 to Mid 25. so the price of $21,781 wasn't too bad for full drive out price. I financed with my credit union, shell, and I got $250 back from them by financing it through shell. I hope this help somebody out there who's looking for a car believe me it pays to shop around online and email quotes. I don't know if it helps any but the place I got it from was Joe Meyers.   not really plugged for them because I've quoted them before in the past and they were higher than everybody else. Good luck on your shopping. On a personal note I would have preferred the Honda CR-V but it was like $3,000 more expensive.

UPDATE:  After 3 years now driving it.  Me giving an update at this point would not really be fair.   To be honest it is not really driven very much.  It only has 5k miles after sll this time.  Still has new car smell.

I do have one complaint.  A button on the top by the rear view mirror broke.  Looks to be defective.  Went ahead and glued it back to avoid taking it in to dealer and comming back.  Was not worth my time.

But it does drive very smooth.  Large room inside.  Much more than my CR-V.  

The reliability of a Toyota, I would suggest if you can find and afford one.  It would be a good investment in a great quality car.  Last for years.  You would buy several cars before this one totally breaks down."
2022-06-05 00:00:00,,"I bought my silver 2018 Rav4 XLE as a certified pre owned unit. I've owned it for 2 years now and it has been flawless. Nothing has broke. Only things I've replaced has been the battery, front brake pads, filters and wipers. I average 26-27mpg city. Seats are very comfortable. The CD stereo sounds great. The Toyota safety sense system is amazing. Parking sensors, radar cruise, lake keep assist. Power liftgate. Sunroof. I also have a older 04 Corolla LE that I use on more mundane tasks since is more fuel efficient, being a smaller car of course. But for long trips and most comfort I love my Rav4. Is the best SUV I've ever owned. I recommend it."

In 3 years I've not had to do anything except for normal maintenance. Not a single issue with the design, function, or performance of this vehicle. This was my 1st foreign built car after GM went bankrupt and dumped 28 years of earned benefits. Every, I mean every GM car I bought new or low mileage had issues.

The black nylon seats are horrible...everything clings to them, and they are uncomfortable as all hell.... started hearing a noise when i make a left turn, almost a thumping sound..will be taking it in shortly for that.

This is my 4th Toyota ; always  XLE Camary.  So here it is ,not a  Camary XLE but a RAV4 Platinum.  I like the car and how it rides and how you sit high.  I enjoy driving it at age 71 and single, I feel safe in it and is easy to get my golf clubs in and out also great when you go grocery shopping. Great for parking and getting in and out of for driver and passengers.

In my opinion, the styling of the my RAV4 is way better than the new model. I love the interior. Dashboard is clean and well designed. Seats and the ride are very comfortable. I'm a fan of the many safety features Toyota includes in all their vehicles as standard equipment. The keyless entry system works well. The power operated tailgate is a bit slow but works well. Unfortunately, the headlights are halogen and not LEDs as my 17' Corolla. I have taken a few trips in my new for me RAV4 and I am so pleased with the quietness, ride, and overall solid feel of the SUV. The 4cyl engine has enough power for this SUV. My fuel economy is approx 26-27 MPG overall on city driving. I do 30-32 MPG on the highway on cruise control set at 70MPH. The 6 speed automatic transmission work very well. My RAV4 color is shinny Silver outside and all black interior. I love the paint quality and how shines when freshly washed. As negatives, I have 2 complaints. First is the radio unit. I have the CD player unit with XM radio but no navigation. The Bluetooth constantly drops and keeps disconnecting my phone while I am on a call. I've read online that this is a known issues with Toyota's radio units. This sound system is weak with low bass and volume power compared to my previous Corolla. Also, I have a XM free trial active and whoever designed this radio should be fired. How can you have XM radio and no way to scroll through the stations from the steering wheel controls? I have to stretch my arm all the way to the tuning knob on the head unit to scroll through hundreds of channels while trying to drive. And my second complaint is the front windshield. I don't know what ""material"" or ""coating"" they use on the outside of the RAV4 but it is impossible to keep the windshield clean and dry. I apply RainX on all my vehicles and this is the first time I see that water just ""stays"" and doesn't repel. I got new wipers and fresh coat of RainX and the water just moves side to side and smears all over the glass. I keep using the wipers and it never gets dry. Always leaves a film and streaks of water. Very weird and not sure how to fix this. In conclusion, I am extremely happy with my purchase. My Toyota dealer in Orlando FL was great and I recommend this RAV4."

I've read online that this is a known issues with Toyota's radio units. This sound system is weak with low bass and volume power compared to my previous Corolla. Also, I have a XM free trial active and whoever designed this radio should be fired. How can you have XM radio and no way to scroll through the stations from the steering wheel controls? I have to stretch my arm all the way to the tuning knob on the head unit to scroll through hundreds of channels while trying to drive. And my second complaint is the front windshield. I don't know what ""material"" or ""coating"" they use on the outside of the RAV4 but it is impossible to keep the windshield clean and dry. I apply RainX on all my vehicles and this is the first time I see that water just ""stays"" and doesn't repel. I got new wipers and fresh coat of RainX and the water just moves side to side and smears all over the glass. I keep using the wipers and it never gets dry. Always leaves a film and streaks of water. Very weird and not sure how to fix this. In conclusion, I am extremely happy with my purchase. My Toyota dealer in Orlando FL was great and I recommend this RAV4."

2021-01-03 00:00:00,,"I traded our RAV4-LE in for the limited edition “2018 Adventure XLE”. Cannot say enough  good about the Toyota RAV4, absolutely the most durable reliable vehicles  on the road."
2020-12-22 00:00:00,,Super sporty looking. Comfortable ride. Great Value and you can’t go wrong with a Toyota. Happy
2020-11-12 00:00:00,,"The car is tight and never a worry about steering or brakes.  Everything is in the right place.
I've even had passengers, pre covid, who commented on the comfy back seat.  
There is a blind spot which is annoying.  I would love an automatic blind sport indicator."
2020-09-29 00:00:00,,"It’s a great comfortable car , not too big"
2020-09-10 00:00:00,,"My Rav 4 leaks from the seals on lower door panels. This I not just moisture but streams of  water running down lower doors , after windy rains storms. I went back to Toyota dealer at least 3 times, had pictures to show them. They continued to say this is normal. Factory rep came out and came to same conclusion that water streaming down doors is normal. I am so disappointed in Toyota and their response. This is not normal. I owned a Honda CR-V before this and overall Honda was a much better quality vehicle. The main reason I did not buy Honda seats were not that comfortable. Please use caution if buying a 2018
Rav 4"
2018-09-01 00:00:00,,"Handles really well - easy to park.  Fun to drive - did disable the radar controlled cruise - braked too much - don't like that.  Took it on long trip - great gas mileage, with a heavily loaded down car.  Held more than I thought it would.  Great price - did shopping online and was more than pleased with deal - Midstate Toyota in Asheboro, NC was very easy to deal with and took less than an hour in dealership to be on the road.  Our 3rd new Toyota and will continue to buy Toyota."
2018-06-21 00:00:00,,I change my RAV4 2018 for the 2019. The problem I have is the new transmission. The transmission makes a noise between 70 and 110km/h. The dealership Bel-Air Toyota in Ottawa scratch my 4 brand new mags and destroyed the envelopes that yhey were in. They told me they didn't care about my mags. When you sell Toyota you should respect the brand name. They have no respect for their clients because they sell so many Toyota that they don't care.
2019-04-11 00:00:00,,I traded a Camry for this vehicle  due to hip problems and the ease of getting into the higher vehicle and also the seat adjustments.  My wife wanted all the safety features it includes.  The vehicle drives and handles well and is pretty quick for a 4cyl.  All the features that were included in the price was a nice factor also.  To get a lot of the standard features in the RAV4 you need to buy much more expensive vehicles.  I am a little disappointed in the noise level of the engine.  It just seems a little loud.  I also thought the gas mileage would be a tad bit better for a 4cly.  Overall a great vehicle for the price.  After owning this vehicle for 2 years the only thing I don't like about it is it seems a bit noisy when you first start it.
2020-03-12 00:00:00,,"I love this vehicle. It handles great, gets great gas mileage, and is surprisingly roomy. Maintenance free for 2 years or 25,000 is a definite plus. I have no complaints!"
2020-02-04 00:00:00,,Smooth quiet ride. Excellent audio system. Great handling
2020-01-21 00:00:00,,"If your key fob dies to your keyless enters. Be prepared. It will cost you about $400 to replace and reprogram. The metal key will only open the door. There is no place to put that particular key into an ignition. In addition, there is no longer a GPS in the car. You must use an ap called SPORT through your phone to project on the car's screen. The graphics are horrible, and the directions are often wrong. Toyota is going to lose customers. I feel like I've been duped. Before you purchase a Toyota, make sure that you know about the built in high cost items like key fobs and reprograming, and horrible Scout GPS system."
2020-01-04 00:00:00,,Very reliable automobile
2020-01-01 00:00:00,,I have the Rav4 Adventure I like the mountains detailing on it and the full mates in the back and on the floor because we have a gravel driveway and we are outdoors people. But I also like comfort so it has heated seats and a sunroof too. I have been a Jeep Cherokee fan for years but the 2018 Rav4 has more get up and go to get into trafic than my Jeep Cherokee did so that is why I made the switch.
2019-12-06 00:00:00,,"I leased a 2018 XLE, right out of the gate the brake pads clunk when backing out of a parking space and then driving forward. The suspension is like a buckboard jumping side to side going around a corner. The drivers seat side bolster frame digs into your ribs. Toyota's response what did the dealer say... nothing wrong, that's how they're built, Toyota well that's the way it is, never bothered to confirm. For $29000 it's a joke. I've owned 7 over 20 years, it was a comfortable great product, not anymore. Nissan ,Hyundai or Kia next time."
2019-11-21 00:00:00,,I just really love my RAV4.I like the way it rides and handles.
2018-05-07 00:00:00,,"I try to drive 62 mph on the highway with cruise on. Get at least 30 mph that way. At first I thought the mph was a bit less than my 2105 RAV4 LE, but after I changed my driving habits I realized I was wrong. The vehicle rides well and is reasonably quiet inside. Had one emergency stop and vehicle performed well.  I am happy with my purchase, and recommend the vehicle."
2018-09-11 00:00:00,,Good Value
2019-08-25 00:00:00,,"My 2011 Rav4 was hit and had to go to the body shop. The other driver's insurance paid for me to get a rental car and I drove a 2018 Rav4 for 3 weeks. It was a very enjoyable experience all around. The interior was roomy and comfortable. I enjoyed the backup camera which was very clear and the tech was adequate. My only complaint was the gas mileage was pretty average (was getting 21 MPG combined city/highway). Highly recommended, Toyota is the best."
2019-04-10 00:00:00,,"The vehicle gets very good gas mileage with the 8 speed transmission. I average about 33-34 mpg. The entertainment system has Apple Play. No android support with the 2019 model year. The Entune system requires a subscription. My Iphone's navigation options work very well with the radio. The sound quality of the entertainment system is quite good. The fm radio sound quality is not very good The seats are comfortable and firm. The first 5 plus years of ownership has been trouble free, something I have come to expect from a Toyota. I wish the car had (at this trim level) heated mirrors and an inside the car & remote control rear hatch release.  Mechanically the vehicle has been flawless for over two years. The tires needed to be replaced due to wear, despite relatively low mileage,  which I find rather typical with the tires on new cars I have purchased."
2019-08-26 00:00:00,,"Purchased a 2019 RAV4 in March after having owned 10, or 11 CRVs. The RAV4 drives like a car. The 2019 CRV drove like my 66 Olds. Took the RAV4  to Fl. and got 44.1 mpg there and 43.2 mpg back to NY. Average mpg around town is 35.5  And this is the gas, not hybrid model. Yes the trans. is a bit jerky but it does have 8 speeds to it. Drive it nicely and it responds nicely. Another trip to FL. and now 45.1 mpg. Wow!!!  Drive it nicely and it responds nicely."
2023-08-07 00:00:00,,"It's  a nice ride.  just wish it had more HP and Torque. I have the JBL sound system.  I have irritated my neighbors a few times play Hair bands as loud as it will go with no distortion.  
   I get about 20mpg in the city around 27 on interstate. No problems and only 1 recall.

Had the thermostat stick open.  Dealer wanted 120.00 for diagnostic service even though I told then what was wrong.  Then another 875 for parts and labor.    it only had 27500 miles on it."
2023-01-26 00:00:00,,"Phenomenal vehicle. Have crossed USA twice and performance is consistent and reliable. And system in snow, ice, mud, gravel and hwy is excellent. 35 mpg avg at 75,000 mi."
2022-05-04 00:00:00,,"Excellent vehicle in every respect very happy with it 41 mile per gallon on the highway 
Just turned over 40,000 miles. Rav hasn't been in the shop for any reason. Just normal maintenance.Thinking of trading it in only to maintain the value. Will definitely buy another one! Only complaint, it is a tad noisy, both engine noise upon acceleration and road noise."
2024-01-06 00:00:00,,"I am 6 foot 2 inches, and my only worry was will my chin and knees get to know each other a little too much, but surprise surprise it has a lot of leg room, not to mention height. The ride is a lot better than I had thought it would be, and I'm very impressed with the gas mileage I get here in town, not taken any trips yet so don't know how it does on the open road, but it's  doing around 28 mpg in town, so I'm  thinking it will be doing a lot better on the open highway."
2019-12-06 00:00:00,,"The 2019 RAV4 is a huge difference/upgraded from previous years  in my opinion.  My must haves were; Heated seats, Moon Roof and remote start.  With the exception of the remote start, the other two features are great and traditional.  As for the remote start, it works, you need cell phone app to use and I do not like this feature for a couple of reasons: 1 - WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SMART PHONE?  2 - It seems to take too long for contact the vehicle to begin the remote start and that may be due to some wifi/internet fault? 3 - I like the classic way to remote start with the key or a key fab; I am in control not the opposite. 4 - There is NO traditional GPS and you have to hook up your Smart Phone, that you may not have, and rely on the app that has to be downloaded to the vehicle and the Smart Phone that you may not have. Such a great vehicle but  very myopic in my opinion."
2021-11-10 00:00:00,,"Attractive, comfortable, but noisy on the road.  Good gas mileage.  Small read -outs on dash, not user-friendly."

It sound everything than the engine of car.... you will be happy only twice with this car when do you buy it and when you sell it
2019-01-21 00:00:00,,"We traded our 2014 Toyota Venza for the Rav4 Limited and we are very happy with our purchase. It's not as smooth and quiet as our 2007 La Crosse or our 2011 Impala but this vehicle rides and handles great and gets good gas mileage. The seats are very comfortable and it is easy to get in and out of with my bad back. My wife is on her 4th Toyota Camry so we have owned a total of 6 Toyotas and they all have been very pleasant and comfortable to drive and very reliable. We drove about 3000 miles from Colorado to Indiana & Ohio and the RAV4 performed beautifully.  To update this review we took two more road trips with our RAV4 Limited. One to Tucson and one to Yellowstone and once again this vehicle performed beautifully. We live in Denver so it does well in the mountains and on the open road.  It has a little more cargo room than the Venza so it is a perfect car for our retirement travel Update july2020. Our RAV4 is still doing a great job for us. No problems. This update is on july 31, 2022. We are still very happy with our RAV4. We recently drove 2600 miles from Denver to Missoula Montana and then to Custer South Dakota. We averaged 28.4 MPG driving a mixture of roads from 40 mph to 80 mph. Had a great vacation with no problems from the RAV."

After many trips back and forth to the dealership, they finally discovered it was coming from roof rack. Fixed it, moved on. I am now noticing the doors fill up with rain water. I don’t have a garage so it is out in the elements 24/7. I wound up clearing a clogged drain on each door and drained about a gallon of water from each door. I’m trading her in at this point…"

No repairs, regular maintenance first two years were free, dealer added one more free.solid as day one.no squeaks rattles, outstanding mpg here in New England.
The vehicle has seemed to adapt to my driving style and is smooth, predictable,and dependable.
Complaints?Minor. Tough getting in and out Drivers seat after 2 hours uncomfortable. Seat cushion solves that.
I am not surprised so many are purchased."
2023-02-25 00:00:00,,"I absolutely love my RAV4! It handles well, it's clean, nice features to it and I love the color! And most exciting it gives me killer gas mileage! I do home Health and I used to have to fill up my Kia twice a week and I can get a whole week's worth of driving out of a tank of gas with my RAV4!"

2019-03-28 00:00:00,,"After reading so many reviews about the engine noise, I test drove a few RAV4 to experience it myself. The engine sound is more pronounce than you would expect but after test driving a few, it probably grown into me that I don't notice the sound when I accelerate. I have my RAV4 for almost a month now and I barely notice the engine sound. I chose the word sound and not noise because it doesn't sound unpleasant to me. Mix gas mileage average at 34 mpg and 38 on highway. I took it for a ride up on a mountain winding road and I don't see any issues accelerating and down shifting going down the winding road. One issue that I've notice is sometimes on a rolling stop, if I step on the gas a little bit harder than I should, the engine will jerk.

23,000 miles after and I don't see any issues with my RAV4. The noise people complain about when accelerating is distance sound for me now. I've learned to drive and timed my acceleration as well on a rolling stop that will avoid the jerk movement. Buying another RAV in the near future for the wife.
65000 miles later and I still don't have any issues with my RAV 4."
2020-03-04 00:00:00,,"Toyota should be embarrassed.  Edmunds.com should reconsider their review. 
I purchased the Rav4 without driving it on the highway. 
1) It is so noisy you cannot communicate with others in this car.  Motor noise during acceleration (as you enter the freeway) is excessive. It would be acceptable if this was diminished at freeway speeds but, this is not the case.  It is really noisy on the road.
2) The lane center feature is unusable. It seems to be overly sensitive.  And, the “lane keep” feature is unavailable unless the “lane center” feature is selected.
I plan to trade this off, as soon as I am financially able. 

Update: I’ve had the car just over a year and have 10,000 miles on it. It is now a love / hate relationship. I still very much dislike the noise on the road. However, I really like the gas mileage on the highway. I am able to get 33 mpg on the highway. City driving is lower at approximately 22 mpg. Still looking for that perfect car ? ? So am I."
2022-08-30 00:00:00,,"I leased the 2019 RAV4 Limited and honestly I almost swore off Toyota for a while after the first few months of driving it (We've been driving Toyotas for 25+ years). After the 6-cyl Highlander, the RAV4 was a huge disappointment, super draggy when accelerating and the engine had a sporadic goose honk sound that was deemed as ""normal for this model"" by the service staff. I don't love that the front passenger seat is manual but it seems so many manufacturers are moving to that as standard. 

I love the size, most of the interior amenities, the safety features, etc... but the noise and low energy driving was too much for me. I was happy to pass this one back to the dealership--but I did love the Hybrid version so they sucked me back in."
2022-08-08 00:00:00,,"We were one of the (many) unlucky ones to experience interior water damage due to the failed seals around and under the low-profile roof rails just two months after the 36 month warranty expired (driven under 30,000 miles, garaged 100%, hand-washed 90%).

Toyota offered no help for the water damage repairs. We called Toyota Brand Experience and were passed around. We were often promised call-backs but rarely got them.

Google ""RAV4 Roof Leak"" and watch the videos and read the many discussion threads before buying. Or, if you own one, you may want to cut and run before it's too late."
2022-07-21 00:00:00,,Pretty blue color with white highlights!
2019-06-28 00:00:00,,"This car has been a sad disappointment (coming from a Toyota family). Terrible gas mileage (6+ under the city rating), incredibly loud cabin, crappy speakers, cheap shortcuts taken (i.e. panoramic sunroof that opens all of 16 inches, vents in only two spots of ventilated seat), no hitch option, headrests are uncomfortable after any more than a short drive and aren't adjustable (other than height).

Very disappointed in a brand with such a good reputation.

Edit: Continue to be disappointed with the gas mileage. After significant highway use, highway mileage (in a very flat place) is about 8 miles under the advertised mileage."
2022-06-22 00:00:00,,"Traded in my Tacoma because I needed something with better gas mileage and since I got it, I've been getting anywhere from 29-32 MPG compared to the 17-19 MPG I was getting in my Tacoma. Everything in the Rav is easily accessible and there is plenty of room for everyone. Absolutely love my new Rav 4."
2019-11-26 00:00:00,,"3000 km's to date and unable to fault. I did initially notice some hesitation when accelerating from a near stop but this has settled and the car accelerates smoothly. Mostly using the eco setting and achieving 5.5 to 7.5 litres per 100km on around 80% rural driving. 
Around the farm on gravel and mud tracks no issues detected. Suspension gives good balance under mixed surfaces.
Steering is much improved on the previous model.
May 2022. Odometer 45000k. Still really happy with this vehicle. 2 negatives. Dust sealing on the rear doors on gravel is poor and the standard tyres on 19inch rims have been prone to punctures and had to be replaced at 43000k. Much better now driving on Maxxis RAZR A/T  245/65 R17. Better all round comfort and suitability for highway, gravel and off road."
2022-05-07 00:00:00,,"To those of you who currently own a 2019 Toyota RAV4, keep your eyes on the headliner and the floor for signs of leaks. My 3 1/2-year-old Toyota RAV4 was leaking from the roof racks! The SUV was never in an accident nor was anything ever placed on the roof. Clearly, the cause of the leak was a manufacturing defect. My cost to replace the roof racks was $783 PLUS $140 to diagnose the leak. To say that I am disappointed would be an understatement. Their well-paid spokesperson, Jan, should replace her ""Let's go places"" ad campaign with ""Let's drive to the dealer and get those roof racks replaced"".Performance2 out of 5 starsComfort4 out of 5 starsValue2 out of 5 stars"
2019-07-06 00:00:00,,"I bought a new 2019 rav 4.  Hesitates at pull off and jecks.  Do not buy.

I was able to research it.  You have to take it to the dealership and have them to calibrate the electronic control module… ECM.  It will work ok after that but the dealership will pretend like they don’t know how to fix it so you have to be consistent.  It’s all about the money."
2021-07-09 00:00:00,,Save yourself some time and don't buy a 2019 Rav4.  I traded mine in after only one year of ownership for a 2013 Siena with a transmission that doesn't lurch!  I think the rav I traded in should be parted out rather than resold to some other poor soul.
2019-03-11 00:00:00,,"GREAT car, lousy Entune 3.0 Remote Connect for remote start, door locks etc. does not work from smart phone. Toyota customer service is worthless, just repeats installation procedure over and over and product does not work. Car VIN shows made in Japan
 Paint at roof rails and seam of door cracking. Latest problem, front differential makes moaning sound when accelerating to 35 mph and decelerating
 What happened to Toyota  quality and reliability? Engine sounds like a cross between a diesel and lawn mower."
2021-09-30 00:00:00,,"2 1/2 years and almost 20K miles. Absolutely no issues . Incredible fuel mileage, confidence on the road , solid and  very stable and predictable on the highway. Great visibility , drivers seat best with a cushion added for long drives. No rattles  , no squeaks , feels like all the other Toyotas I have owned. Transmission has  “smoothed out “ quite a bit as the mileage has gone up. Like many other vehicles I have owned and driven  driver adaptability to the vehicles individual personality is paramount to enjoyment. Fit and finish is superb, paint job shines like it is brand new. It is not garaged here in New England. No pitting, rust or visible signs of wear  on the wheels or molding. Very good in the rain and snow. Standard sound system lacks a CD player, but an add on portable DVD player plugged in sounds fantastic. Good FM reception and dynamic range. 
Very pleased and satisfied with this purchase. Would only consider trading it in for a Highlander for more room. Otherwise, it is a keeper. I have purchased 10 Toyotas in my lifetime, this is the most refined  out of all of them. 
Recently took a 260 mile round trip, the majority highway driving and averaged 36.6 MPG according to the data in Eco mode."
2019-10-21 00:00:00,,"I've made the trip from my daughters house in NY to Pittsburgh many times in my Buicks … this time rented a Toyota RAV4.... it was from long island NY to Pittsburgh. I was pleased when they said they ""upgraded"" me to a SUV because the car I rented was not available. But when I finally got home and went to the gas station for the second time I could not believe the numbers for the MPG.  It got a little less than 23mpg? It's a 4cyl buzzy little engine that downshifted a thousand times during the trip... and only got 23mpg?  My daughters 310HP V6 equinox gets over 27mpgh with 3 people and two large dogs with performance that's much better. The other thing I found out is that over 70 mph you loss stability... something I've never experienced in a vehicle in 50 years. The speed limit was 70mph in a large portions of my trip but I had to keep the speed to 65mph to be comfortable in this vehicle?... The short wheelbase and high stance makes for a uncomfortable unstable ride over 70mph... something my Buicks do with ease... and with far smoother more quiet ride... and much better mpg?
Not sure what the MPG is around town... if the MPG is 23 on highway?
Pretty disappointing rental to say the least."
2021-10-16 00:00:00,,Bought 2019 RAV4 adventure. Had grinding noise too. It’s torque vectoring clutch making noise. Dealership fixed by changing clutch. It’s under warranty because it’s a manufacturer problem. Never had problems with performance just a noise. Don’t regret my purchase! Love my RAV4. Dealerships know this problem. They should fix it. Only took one day to repair.
2021-03-16 00:00:00,,"The sound system in these vehicles is absolutely terrible. If you plan to use BlueTooth to speak with anyone, forget it with this crappy sound system. There is so much background noise and your voice comes through to other people as muffled. People actually tell me to call them back when I get home because it's just so annoying. Really frustrating considering I got rid of my 2010 Infinity with a fantastic sound system and the ability to get Sirius radio (which this RAV cannot get because of course Toyota never has any bells or whistles). Really regret this purchase."
2020-04-13 00:00:00,,"To start with, I must admit that I’m dumbstruck by all the negative reviews on here. A lot of people seem to inadequately research and test their vehicles before buying. Minor niggles turn into 1-star reviews on here and “I’ll never buy Toyota again” threats. Isolated warranty claims yield bad reviews, also.
I’ll start by saying that the transmission lurching problem has had a fix since August 2019. Since, my transmission has been near-flawless. It seems to be, along with the Adventure’s transfer case, the only widespread problem. For the latter, Toyota has gotten around to replacing them (they had exceptional delays for parts, in early-to-mid-2019). My Toyota dealership and Toyota at the corporate level have been fantastic. For those who are looking for a new RAV4, this means 2020 models don’t have these problems.
The engine is a bit unrefined, granted, but it isn’t a deal-breaker (I had noticed before purchasing the vehicle that it was very loud while accelerating, but it’s one of the only foibles this car has, IMO). It also isn’t turbocharged like some rivals, so it’ll be more durable and less pricey to maintain. It’s more powerful than most, but if it’s too slow for some, there’s the Hybrid and Prime, although I’ve never yearned for more power and our other vehicle is quicker and more powerful.
I must say that I’m impressed with Toyota’s new vehicle designs. The RAV4 Adventure is handsome, and my car’s two-tone Blue Flame on Ice Edge (white) roof turns heads.
I thought I’d talk about the supposedly cheap-looking and feeling cabin. In the LE, it’s the case, but as you go up the ladder, material quality is better. It’s a solid, well-assembled cabin. I also like its “tough” look, and the orange elements in the Adventure trim.
Adaptive Cruise Control and the other active safety features are amongst the best I’ve experienced. Sure, you can’t turn ACC into regular cruise control, but it’s the same with most car manufacturers. I only know of Volvo that gives the option. Lane-keeping and centering, when the lane marking are visible, works very well, too. I’ve only had to use automatic emergency braking once (thankfully), but it really works!
I haven’t had problems with the infotainment system. It’s large and within easy reach. It works well, although it’s slightly slow. I’ve never had a problem connecting to Apple CarPlay (that I use most of the time).

Overall, I love my RAV4 Adventure. It’s handsome and pleasant to drive, while being very spacious and comfortable, and has a well-laid-out interior. Fuel economy is competitive. It also should have an exceptional resale value and has respectable maintenance costs. 

Update (December 2020) : My opinion of this vehicle, that I’ve had nearly 2 years and 20 000 miles, hasn’t changed. I still appreciate it, and I haven’t had any other problems. 3 friends and family members now have a RAV4 in their driveway. It is still, in my opinion, one of the best vehicles in its segment, for the above reasons. For those that may be discouraged by all these reviews, keep in mind that this is the best-selling non-pickup in the country. Reliability-wise, the current-generation CR-V has fared far worse. It is currently subject to 2 lawsuits over serious defects. If, however, you don’t want a RAV4, I’d recommend the Kia Sportage. The current generation model is quieter inside the cabin, is well-built and has so far proven reliable. My mother and sister, that have a 2018 (with 40 000 miles) and a 2020 model (with 8 000 miles), respectively, have had no problems whatsoever. They’ve only had to go to the dealer for scheduled maintenance.

I hope this will help you make a better-informed choice."
2019-09-05 00:00:00,,"Thought we'd make the move from Camrys to this little crossover SUV for it's safety features.  The safety features are impressive.  What isn't impressive is the road, engine and wind noise.  The ride is a little on the rough side as well.  Add to that a rattle noise in the steering column or instrument panel that comes and goes depending on speed and road surface.  Another surprise issue is a case of torque steer that occurs when hitting the gas aggressively while passing.  This causes the vehicle to pull to the right, toward the vehicle you are passing.
On the plus side, the interior is pretty decent for a vehicle in this price class.  The addition of rubber tray type floor mats is a nice touch for those of us living in New England or other snowy places.  The mileage is decent.  On long road trips with the car loaded we can get up to 34 mpg when driving in ECO mode.
Overall, I'm unimpressed with this vehicle and probably would not purchase another RAV4 unless improvements are made to remedy the issues mentioned.  Toyota should consider shifting some of their TV advertising budget over to quality improvement.

Now, two years into ownership, the same problems or dislikes still exist.  I did narrow the rattle down to somewhere in the steering column, but have yet to find a cure - very annoying.  I will add that the the expansive front windshield and expansive black dashboard top surface make a great solar heating source.  The car gets very hot on sunny summer days which can challenge the air conditioner.

September 2021 - finally found the rattle location, where the top of the ateering wheel meets a cowling in front of the steering wheel.  Made a plastic “wedge” to insert there and it stopped the annoying rattle.  The large black dashboard top creates a lot of heat on sunny days.  Very poor idea to have that large an expanse of black surface.  It's like riding in a dutch oven on sunny days.  I would not buy another RAV4 with a black interior and a very large windshield."
2021-08-30 00:00:00,,Leased for 3 years then bought it. Love it.
2021-08-17 00:00:00,,It's important to note that the vast majority of issues mentioned in reviews from 2019 have been resolved as a result of recalls and software updates. This car is pretty bulletproof and I've only loved it more after driving it for 6 months (7k miles)!
2019-08-01 00:00:00,,"I purchased my new 2019 Toyota RAV4 Limited FWD, not a hybrid 25 months ago and I have been fully retired for the last 7 months and not driving as much having only 16,500 miles on my odometer.  My overall mpg is 28.2 mpg with mostly city driving in short distance trips of about 20 minutes and when I take long trips between Slidell Louisiana and Birmingham Alabama it gets 33.5 mpg. Engine noise is average, but road noise is disappointing considering the cost of this vehicle. My RAV4 is garage kept and well maintained and always looks like it just came out of a showroom. I have not had any problems with the power train or electronic systems. The navigation system maps are original design and Toyota has not released any updates for the maps since 2018 for my vehicle that does not have an SD slot. I mentioned the map situation since my vehicle cannot get me to the new New Orleans International Airport that was relocated in 2020. The Entune 3.0 Entertainment and Information system receives updates via the cloud automatically when released. The acceleration is average and all the safety systems are outstanding. Comfort in the front and rear seating is very good.  I downgraded my initial rating because of the road noise and Toyota not providing the means to update maps. My Android cell phone interfaces with the vehicle perfectly except it does not work with apple car play like my wife’s apple phone that can link current maps using that method. I have a trakfone costing me $120 a year and her apple iPhone cost her more than that per month."
2021-07-25 00:00:00,,2.5 liters should give you a good feel when you accelerate but not with rav 4. Excessive engine noise is another issue. Cheap plastic parts. Seats are not comfortable at all and starting a make noise with in first year of use. Touch screen is not very responsive after few weeks and streeing mounted buttons and door buttons are for day use only as they don't light up in the dark you have to train your brain to learn them. Only thing is it's good on gas. Smooth ride. And a few safty features keep your insurance low some times. And oil change cost is low.

2021-07-14 00:00:00,,"I also had the grinding and mooing sound in my RAV4 Adventure. I took it to the dealer who fixed it, and 6000 miles later it started again.  Toyota sent a 125K mile warranty for the part that causes the issue, but I don't want to go to the dealer every 6000 miles and have to prove to them that it's making the sound again before they fix it.  Also the traction control is starting to go out.  I also thought the transmission was jerky and slow to react.  It would pause when accelerating from a stop before taking off - annoying and dangerous.  It doesn't have the CVT transmission like a lot of newer cars, making for a more old-fashioned drive.  I also felt like I was driving a big, slow tank. There is a range of VINs to avoid if you're buying this car, that are impacted by the grinding problem.  Check out the service bulletins online - they list the range.  I'd at least avoid those, but would not recommend this vehicle, in general.  It's not good quality.  I usually buy and keep cars for 10 years.  I had to get rid of this one after only one year.  First and last Toyota for me."
2019-07-06 00:00:00,,"I bought a new 2019 rav 4 on April of 2019.  I didn’t notice it during the test drive, but it jerks and hesitates at pull off from stop signs and red lights.  The transmission is faulty.  Do not buy.

I’m updating this review.  About a year later in July of 2020, after I purchased the 2019 RAV4, I called the Toyota dealership again to see if they found a fix for the issue with the transmission.  The dealership never acknowledged that the transmission had an issue that they were aware of.  I explained  to the dealership again that so many people on all of these different websites have put their reviews about the transmission on the RAV4 so how do you not know about it… They still said that they had no known recall on it and for me to call Toyota customer service.  

While on the phone with them, I had already found an article that was very very reputable and it laid out the issue and the resolution and so I explained to them that the issue has been addressed in this article and the resolution has been addressed and that I wanted them to fix it and so they had no choice but to fix it.  

When I called Toyota customer service, they too pretended as though they had no clue of the issue or the resolution.

Basically the tech had to re-calibrate the electronic control module (ECM). I bought the car in Apr of 2019 but they didn’t fix it until July of 2020.  They only fixed it because I forced them too. 

I sold the car with 22K miles on it.  Bottom line is that Toyota didn’t care.  

Very hurtful experience."

2019-08-25 00:00:00,,"I bought my 2019 RAV4 XLE last April and regret that decision every day I have to drive it. When accelerating from - 0 - to 40 mph, the engine screams like a banshee. That would be fine if I was driving a Shelby Cobra, but not a RAV4. When turning corners, there is a hesitation when you press on the accelerator that feels like the engine is about to die. I try to counteract the screaming engine by listening to music with the volume level cranked up to 40 and/or taking about 20 seconds to get up to 30 from a dead stop. Although the latter method will usually result in other drivers honking or giving me the one finger salute. I have purchased 12 new cars/trucks in my lifetime (many used ones) and the 2019 RAV4 ranks second from the bottom. It’s edged out by a Hyundai Tiburon I purchased for my daughter about 15 years ago, which was a real lemon. I did test drive the RAV4, but the sales rep talking all the time distracted me somewhat from the engine noise issue. I did mention something about it, but grossly underestimated how much of a problem it would be in the long run. I wished I had shopped around more and test drove a few other models like the Honda CR-V and the Nissan Rogue. About the only positive thing I can say about the ‘19 RAV4 is that I like the way it looks, both inside and out. It also has some excellent safety features, including a warning signal when you are backing out if there are cars approaching you from any direction. If I had it to do over again, I definitely  would not purchase this vehicle."
2020-02-19 00:00:00,,"It's hard to believe it's been a year and a half since we've owned our 2019 Toyota RAV4 XLE and just as predicted it's been a great car.  No issues, no warning lights, no funny noises, it's just Toyota reliable.  I did mention about the jerky transmission a while ago that plagues the new gen RAV4s along with the current gen Camrys.  However, I was able to schedule an appointment for a software update that's available for vehicles affected.  It was well worth the hour and a half wait for it!  It did wonders to our car!  Now it shifts like it's supposed to.  I got this done in July 2020 and hasn't let us down since.  For anyone that hasn't gotten this done yet, do so soon!"
2021-02-05 00:00:00,,"My main complaint with this vehicle is the infotainment system - which is app-based. The car does not come standard with GPS - you have to use the app called Scout which gives terrible directions and inaccurate timings. Everything is app-based, therefore you need unlimited on your phone. Then, if you have no phone signal, nothing works. Half the time when the Toyota decides to do an update it stops connecting to your phone. It is not Android Auto or Apple Auto based, so it truly is absolute crap!
The car itself, drives fine, also when needing to get up to speed quickly it sounds like you’re killing it. It is very economical though
I cannot wait to trade this in for something else, I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle"

I am very pleased with this vehicle and look forward to many more visits to the Team Toyota dealership in Langhorne PA ."
2023-02-07 00:00:00,,"Alot I don't like about this car, auto shut off at stop lights, radar that slows you down on it's own, I hate all the smart features. In addition to that the transmission sounds cheap and cheesey, gonna go out for sure."
2020-01-27 00:00:00,,"After purchasing  this xle premium,  on the way home from the dealership, the check engine light came on accompanied by a slight bump in the power delivery.  About 25 miles on the odometer.  It was returned the next day where it has been in the shop ever since (over 3 weeks and counting)  awaiting parts.  It was diagnosed as a bad O2 sensor but there are none available anywhere in the US right now.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 for having only driven it to the dealership and back is the toyota service has been very good in honoring their warrantee.  They gave me a brand new rental from Enterprise and are covering incidental costs from having to pay for parking (employee parking sticker is only valid for car registered in my name).  This is my first Toyota branded car.  Right now I'm wondering if I should have bought the CR-V instead.  

Update:  3 years later and 77,000 miles later, this car has been very good.  I do a lot of highway driving and the one thing keeping it from 5 stars is the road noise.  I've replaced the tires with Michelin's best to try to keep it quieter in the cabin.  As you get to 65+ mph, you WILL have to increase the volume on your stereo.  And at 75, you will have to increase it A LOT!  This is a very reliable, useful, and fun car to own.  City driving is perfect.  Highway driving is fine for driving but not so much for talking on the phone or listening to music.  A little more care in the sound proofing would have made it 5 stars."

2020-02-21 00:00:00,,"What was an impressive test drive has turned into disappointment after living with the RAV4 for 2 months. 
Highs: Nice road manners, quite once at speed, comfortable and attractive interior, large storage capacity*. Ventilated seats (I live in the desert). Radar cruise control.
Lows: Transmission acts more like a CVT, indecisive gear selections. Engine is very harsh and noisy while getting to cruising speed. Rear view mirror is nauseating in camera mode and worthless at night- luckily it can be turned off. Lane safety feature is overly sensitive and picks up road repairs, constantly battling the car trying to steer itself-luckily it can be turned off. Other than the radar cruise control, safety features seem more gimmicky than useful. Large storage capacity but limited storage solutions, groceries need to sit on floor behind seats or they wind up all over the place. Toyota Financial customer service is a joke, be sure to understand their monthly payment structure in detail before you sign anything"
2021-01-22 00:00:00,,"Update - After driving the competition, the Hyundai Tucson 2.5L is a better choice.

Noisy cabin, sun visors rattle constantly which is very annoying, much more road noise than I'm accustomed to.  Acceleration lag is excessive IMHO, otherwise power is good, engine appears to work well for the size of vehicle and transmission shifts nicely, gas mileage seemed average or slightly above average.  Lane Centering doesn't work very well, however Android Auto works well."
2020-01-08 00:00:00,,"I purchased my 2020 Limited Rav4 back in November.  Having driven a little over 1000 miles so far, I’m favorably impressed.  I actually wanted to buy the hybrid version but after several months I couldnt find the color combination I wanted and the dealers were marking the price up over MSRP.  Toyota has seemed to address the two issues I was concerned about, which was engine noise and low-speed shifting of the 8-speed transmission.  Extra sound-proofing has been added to the engine compartment and a TSB has was implemented in August and the transmission seems to shift fine for me.  In a combination of city and highway driving I’m only getting 28 mpg from the gas motor, so the 35 mpg highway seems optimistic.  I have the tech pkg which includes the birds eye view cameras which help in parking...it also includes the phone charging pad but I need to upgrade my iPhone 6 for it to work...the camera in the rear view mirror is useful if your cargo area is full and you want to see behind you.  The car is loaded and has the weather pkg, which I really like the heated steering wheel on cold days.
July 2022 update:  I’ve now put 10,600 miles on the Rav4 and the car continues to be fun-to-drive and reliable.  The local Toyota dealer has done both of the free services (e.g. oil/filter change and tire rotation at 5k and 10k miles approximately).  I did have the TSB applied for the firmware and DCM software upgrade which solves a problem that can drain the 12v battery.  The dealer checked the battery at the same time and said it was “o.k.”, but I was getting low readings on my own analysis of the battery and had to charge it for 5 hours to get it to close to normal charge voltages.  Subsequently I replaced the OEM battery with a new Duracell AGM-type battery that I had more confidence in."

2021-12-24 00:00:00,,"I’ve driven many 2020 RAV4s on road trips for work and I’m not impressed. 

So the positives are I find the seats comfortable, it has good standard safety tech and the hybrid powertrain is nice. 

But, The non hybrid powertrain is noisy and lacks refinement. The 8 speed automatic isn’t responsive in some scenarios and can have rough shifts. Lots of wind noise at highway speeds which gets annoying. Infotainment is starting to look dated. Base sound system is terrible, and the interior quality and materials is subpar.  

I find it cheap that for around $30k Toyota couldn’t give us alloy wheels and a leather wrapped steering wheel on the LE trim. Overall it feels and drives like a cheap suv. 

Mazda CX-5, Honda CRV, Jeep Cherokee all feel nicer and drive better."

The car was less than a year old when the issues started with the Battery draining.  They keep blaming it on everything but the car battery.  They say I don't drive it enough and I asked what was enough as I drive it daily to work.  They said I probably use the GPS and my phone and all of the technology too much.  That is quite absurd as I don't even own a cell phone and usually just use the radio.  I think it is time for Toyota to recall these cars and get the Battery updated.  You can't even be sure if your car will start in the morning, so my family has to wait to make sure I can start the newest car on the driveway before they can leave.  I am shocked how nonchalant they are about this car.  It is sad as I do own an older Prius that has no issues.  I will be replacing the Prius soon and I can truly say that for the first time I am not even looking at Toyota.  Are you listening Toyota, you are now losing customers. So sad and upsetting!

2021-07-01 00:00:00,,"I want to start this review by stating that I owned a 2018 Rav 4 LE which I loved for the most part. I loved the spacious cabin. I loved the comfy bucket seats in the back. I loved the comfy seats in the front. I traded in the for the (more luxurious model?) 2020 Rav 4 xle. The first thing that I noticed was how much less head room you have in the driver's seat, but figured that I would get used to it. A month later I rode in the passenger seat and I wondered how a tall person could even sit in the passenger seat due the positioning of the seat in the car, with no way to lower it. After taking it on a long trip, I realized that the old LE had MUCH more comfy seats. Also, my passengers in the back seat now have a much less luxurious ride in bench seat that sits straight up, is not adjustable and is hard as a rock! Also, for those that say this car is noisy. It has a very loud acceleration. The lane assist will pull you very hard for no reason at time. Now- the things that I do love about the 2020 Rav. The seats are vinyl and therefore very easy to wipe clean and keep nice looking. I also love the new LED screen. The whole front dash seems much nicer. The visibility is higher. The new exterior body design is AMAZING, (this is what sold me).Of course I also love the moonroof which comes standard in the 2020 xle. I like how the RAV 4 handles hills.I have noticed that the paint on this model is not road rashing the way that the 2018 RAV 4 was, but I went from a glossy black to a metallic silver, so I believe that this is likely the difference."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,,"I have a 2020 Toyota RAV4 hybrid XSE. When I first purchased the vehicle I noticed that I would fill up my tank and the fuel indicator would be below “full” every time I filled up. Later I noticed the screen on the JBL system that would glitch and turn black on me. The volume knob stops working occasionally. One day I opened my moonroof and when I arrived at my destination, I attempted to close it and it would not close at all. I also have the Toyota care app that lets you start/stop and open/close your doors, during the winter when I needed it the most it would not connect or work at all. I took the vehicle in for service at Toyota Hodgkin in IL. They told me the system needed a software upgrade but failed to ever mention that to me until I brought it in personally. I recorded several of the issues I was experiencing and was glad I did. Finally they tell me my car is ready and as I was driving out of the dealership lot I tested the vehicle. My moonroof was still messed up. I left the vehicle there and was given a loaner. When I returned they were unable to completely solve the issue with the moonroof and told me to bring it back when I return for my 10k service. Today I go to start my car to get to work, the battery is completely dead. I was late for work, had to get a ride and when I returned late at night I had to call road side for a jump start. The person they sent out to jumpstart my car related to me that they get several calls for the 2020 hybrids about the vehicles not starting. I have never had my car sitting for more than a day so I don’t see why this is happening and the car is only a year old. Now I have to waste more time to drive the car back to the dealership for service. I bought a Toyota because they had a good reputation. I’m very disappointed with Toyota’s many problems.

It has the following  poor design faults.
1) The Limited model has 14 control switches for heating/cooling is a total waste, way too complex and the printing on the switches is too small to read. Difficult to use.

2) No storage space, can’t store anything else within the spare tire space either. Side pockets are basically useless for practical storage use.

3) Video rearview mirror has vibration while driving that makes this expensive feature totally worthless, it’s a gimmick, not at all practical.

4) Hard plastic located on sides of drivers seating position makes it uncomfortable on the sides of drivers knees. The door handles are too large and hit your knees, the driving area is very cramped."

2021-04-06 00:00:00,,"Our 2020 RAV4 sat in our driveway for four days and had a dead battery.  We jumped it and let it run and drove it for 2 hours.  It sat for a couple hours and it is dead again.  The car is under 12 months old therefore, it should NOT have a dead battery.  There is something defective with this 2020 car battery.  In addition, the cloth tan seats stain very easily, even water leaves a stain. These are the poorest quality upholstery ever.  Finally, the three seats in the back always trigger the fasten seat belt light even if nothing is on the seat.  The only way the light and beeping sounds turn off is when you fasten all the empty seatbelts.  This is not the quality I expect from a Toyota."
2021-03-18 00:00:00,,"We have had many Toyota models over the years in my family going back to the 1980's. I am familiar with the brand and many of it's models. We, like many others came to love the company for their long-term reliability and impeccable craftsmanship, although after driving this one I may have to examine some of those points on the new vehicles. Recently I took a road trip from Southern Colorado to Tennessee. I have a 2004 Low Mileage Avalon XLS as my personal car at this time, but I didn't wanna put the wear and tear on it, so I rented a 2020 Rav4 XLE FWD. I drove the car for 8 days and approx. 3,100 miles. 

I liked the room and the high seating position. However, I am 6'5"" and found the bottom seat cushion really uncomfortable after a few hours. The cushion is too short. I had virtually no thigh support. I did stop and buy a butt pillow made for a car and that helped a little bit, but the 16 year old seats in my Avalon are better by far. I would think that in a 2020 model, Toyota would know how to make a supportive seat. The power adjustments were ok, but the lack of thigh support really affected me. I also don't like this new cheaper upholstery they use. Seems like it would be harder to clean than velour used to be. 

The infotainment screen kept freezing intermittently. Got tired of dealing with it and just used my bose bluetooth speaker and kept it in the passenger seat. Makes me kind of miss old radios a bit. When the technology is not reliable it is downright hazardous. Someone with less patience and driving experience would easily get into an accident while trying to fiddle with this crappy device. 

The car is very loud. My word is it loud. I get that this is a utility vehicle and not an Avalon or a Lexus. But the 2002 CR-V my company owns as a business vehicle is quieter on the highway. The engine just sounded very thrashy and noisy, not really what one would expect from Toyota. The vibrations and road noise from the tires weren't much better. I rented in November of 2020. Vehicle was manufactured in May and had 9,300 Miles on it when I had possession of it. Just didn't seem overall like what I would come to expect from an ""XLE"" trim level from any Toyota model. The XLE is supposed to be usually top of the line, but I know that it has moved mid range to base on some models in recent years, but still. A fairly disappointing package overall. Hard plastic door panels and a stark black interior that drive home the point that Toyota is becoming somewhat unremarkable. I was starting to suspect this when I beheld the very cheap 2008 Corolla years ago, but this vehicle really confirms it. The cargo space was wonderful and with rear seat down, almost cavernous. Probably the best feature of this vehicle. 

I didn't really calculate my exact MPG on the trip, but I stopped infrequently enough for gas that I was happy. MPG didn't seem like it was too terrible. Another pro I suppose. That made up for the lack of power the 2.5L engine seemed to have. Had to really punch it to pass at times on the freeway. 

Overall the Rav4 comes across as a mediocre rental. I can only imagine what a buyer with remorse must be feeling. It really kind of feels about on par in some ways with the Ford Explorer of 2001-2005 ish. Decent, passable transport that doesn't offend or delight really, but also lacks any meaningful refinement or touches. Toyota has proven that they are now about on par with Ford of 20 years ago. I have also read a few things about these vehicles having a fire risk. One that Toyota still has not determined the cause of. I guess after reading some of these other reviews about the Rav4, I should also be glad it started every time while I had it. 

My final verdict would have to be that this is nothing special overall. I certainly wouldn't buy one after renting one."

2021-01-03 00:00:00,,Test drive was great and for the first month I always very happy. The first time I went to fill the tank up it wouldn’t take a full tank. This is a very common problem that Toyota has promised to fix but as of  January 2021 no fix has been announced. Also after 6 months the fuel efficiency began to suffer. Advertised at 40/mpg avg I’ve managed to only get roughly 33/mpg. I live in San Francisco and have hills but also the car promises to be better in cities. Anyway wish I could go back. I have the 2020 XSE.

2020-11-24 00:00:00,,"This is my 2nd Rav4 and I bought this one since I was so happy with my 2014.  However, although many improvements have been made to the 2020 model, one area of concern is the cargo support base (the cover that hides the spare tire and lets you pile stuff on top).  The manufacturer and the engineer must have used different tape measures since the base has about a 1/3"" gap on the side.  This causes the platform to fall onto the spare tire.  Be warned if you carry anything that has liquid, when it falls you are left with a mess to clean up.  Bad design and how quality control missed this is not what Toyota is known for.  Since this issue is fairly new it may take some time for other owners to recognize this problem and start complaining to Toyota.   Remember there is strength in numbers, if enough people bring this to Toyota's attention, maybe they'll do something about it."
2020-11-21 00:00:00,,"We purchased Rav4 2020 Limited in April 2020. We were using Rav4 2008 till now, and compared to the 2008 model, this present Rav4 2020 Limited is not as good in terms of interior space, pickup  cabin heating etc. After the first snow, we find that the windows are frozen, and we cannot slide open in the cold environment. Overall the quality has deteriorated compared to the older model. Only plus point are the new safety features."
2020-11-20 00:00:00,,"I am an owner of a 2020 rav4 bought in May2020.  I brought my car in for service for concerns in regards of my brake and overheating problems. The brake grind problem usually is heard when I hit the brakes with the auto hold function on, once the auto hold activates, then the start/stop activates to save gas. Once it automatically turns the engine on again, the car jerks a little accompanied with the grinding/burping sound. There was a time when my foot was actually on the brake pedal when the same thing happened, and it almost feels like there’s air in the brake line from the vibration/sensation sent to my foot. My foot on the brake pedal depressed further to the floor when the engine turned on after the start/stop function and it felt like bubbles being forced through a small space if that make sense. The grinding/burping sound is not always there but it happens too often for comfort. 

Then a 2nd concern happened in Nov2020. I was sitting in the drive thru for about 30-40 mins when my air conditioning suddenly blew hot air. It got pretty steamy in the car really quick so I tried to hit the windshield defroster. That’s when it started to smell like something burning. At first I thought it was coolant or something electrical. That made me roll down the window to let some cool air in to clear the windshield. Right after that is when I looked at my dashboard and noticed the needle on the high hot side, almost on the red part. As soon as I got my food I went and parked my car and to let it cool for a bit. It was 58° outside at that time so it helped a lot. Driving home, the car was on limp mode, almost hesitant to accelerate the whole time. Needle being on the hot side still, luckily I’m just a mile away from home."

I towed it to the house checked the battery it was good,so it led me to the starter. I've been an ase mechanic 50yrs and worked on everything . But I pulled the starter took it to a starter shop here in town,I've used these guys for the past 20yrs on everything from heavy equipment to lawn mowers and they never have disappointed me. They said the starter was good. So I went back home put it back on,now if you have to ever take one of these cars apart be prepared,they stuffed the starter in the engine,it's not an easy task to get to. I put it back together and it fired right up. I didn't find any reason why the car wouldn't start. That was in August, now it's doing it again. I'm gonna run some test and find out why it does this and let ya know ."
2023-08-16 00:00:00,,"First of all, I don't own this vehicle, Its a rental that I've been using for a month after my car was totaled. I find a lot to like about this vehicle,.... the gas mileage is remarkable and I have averaged 35mpg in the month I have driven it with strict highway use being almost 40mpg!! I fine it to be a comfortable vehicle. It is rather quiet, a good ride, and the seats are good once you adjust them correctly for oneself. The engine has good power and generally is smooth. The steering, and overall handling are no less than good,... but here is where my concerns come into play. The lane control feature is much too sensitive and I found I was making constant steering corrections to counter what the computer thought. Turning it off made for much better steering. The active Cruise Control is also a problem as it overreaches and applies the brakes when there is absolutely no reason to do so. Keeping set to its lowest sensitivity setting helps,.. but it even activated itself when a passing vehicle would come a little too close!! The comments about engine noise are on the money. Engine performance is quite good,.. but the engine becomes a thrasher when pressed. A feature that I liked though is the warning lighting in the side mirrors letting one know that someone is in your blind spot and that and when backing up. 

Overall, I found this to be a darn good vehicle that I would consider buying."

2022-12-20 00:00:00,,I traded in a CX-5 for a 2021 Rav- limited and it is now going into 2023 in 2 weeks.  The CX-5 was a better all over vehicle.  The Rav-4 gets maybe 25 mpg with engine noiseless.  The passenger seat is a manual and at the price its stupid.  The 2.5 literaly engine pretty well is lame.  Now I  have a rattling noise coming out of the area of the passenger vent.  I found out the passenger seating is not that big when I have 4 adults in the cabin.  As soon as the interest rates go down I will sale or trade it in on another vehicle.   The quality is not there.
2022-10-25 00:00:00,,"I gave up my 2010 Prius with 285000 miles for a brand new Rav 4. I wanted to love a fresh start with a new Toyota. I was disappointed from the first week. I don't give up on relationships that quick, so have stuck it out for two years hoping I might learn to love it. My 2021 Rav 4 is annoying and an expensive disappointment. For example, I keep a small flashlight handy so I can find the interior lights, or gas door release, they are not lit up so end up opening the sunroof and the hood. usually open the sun food by accident. The interior lights are not very useful, the cargo area is like a cave when unloading at night. 
If driven any distance on a dirt road, the inside of all the door frames are caked with dust. It's as if the rubber seals are of no use at all. That includes the gas door. Water also collects in the frames. The paint job is weak. Just look at it and scratches appear! I don't have long nails, and am not heavy handed, scratched all around the door handles as if it were used much more than it has. Blind spots are huge. So many steps to figure out some options that I feel like I'm doing The hokey pokey, and turn myself around. Because, that's what it's all about."

It is on the steering wheel and it pictures a car that is tilted, almost falling. I found out about it from the Toyota dealer and now I feel safe. Before, my hands got tired from keeping the car straight on the road. And yes, above 65mph gave me  so much stress and fear. Not anymore. I am sure, book has the explanation for all the features, but most of us don’t read it. Maybe dealers should worn the buyers."

Most of the time my car is parked in the garage.  Will never purchase this car again.

Break system is very good as well has stable during hard breaking.. Road noise ? Very quite. The motors does get heard when mashing the gas, but what do you expect. Got the LE AWD with cloth seat, didn't want leather. The reason I went with the Toyota is the 100,000 mile warranty is transferable, when non of the other would transfer. When you pay $30K for a vehicle, put 7K miles on it, then get a offer from the dealer of $5K more than I paid for it, seems I did good on this one."
2022-04-09 00:00:00,,"I purchased my 2021 Toyota Rav4 new in August. The panels between the front and rear windows on both sides of my car are discolored and look like the plastic is melting. Magee Toyota in Hanover, MA replaced one side in January. Within a month both side panels discolored again right where the brackets are. I contacted Toyota and requested a meeting with a Toyota Service Department supervisor. They had a representative contact me, and I was told that the problem is Solar related and they will not help with the problem. I have a bumper to bumper warranty and the windows are between the bumpers, but they will do nothing."

2022-01-12 00:00:00,,"Hired the Hybrid and was looking forward to it.

Economy was 6 litres/100Km on mostly country driving.  Not good as my 2.0 litre 2005 BMW gets the same and does not need a battery that will need replacing at a sizeable cost.

Dynamics were ok for an entry level car.  The ABS did not do very well when stopping on dirt roads.  The traction control was worse.  If you accelerated too hard, the back swung out to the side.  Possibly it is an early (and cheaper) generation traction control unit.  Latest generation traction control and ABS measure wheel slip many times a second and hence the wheel does not noticeably slip as it slipping is stopped just as it starts.  The Toyota seemed to have a less sophisticated control unit as the wheels spun, stopped spinning, spun again, stopped spinning and spun again, which is why the rear end slid out sideways.  May work better on smooth bitumen?

Comfort was good in the front seats.  I can see people taking a test drive and being impressed.  The road noise while on a highway in the back was quite high as there is little sound insulation for the rear passengers  and the boot has places with no sound insulation at all.  To speak to the rear passengers needed us in the front to raise our voices so much that it was better to speak when in towns with slower road speed. The windows did not stop the sun burning through onto your arm. More advanced cars use different glass that looks the same but stops most of the heat getting through so passengers are more comfortable, the aircon does not need to work as hard, etc."

At 3,423 miles my transmission went out in my new 2021 Rav 4. While stranded in dangerous Atlanta traffic I realized that I can no longer trust Toyota. They don’t make them like they used too! Being a mechanic for 25 plus years I would recommend staying with Japanese car manufacturers for daily drivers, but not Toyota or Honda. Do yourself a favor and buy a Mazda or Subaru. After my warranty covered the cost to replace my transmission I traded the Rav 4 in for a Subaru Crosstrek sport and I love it. It will live much longer and has great AWD capabilities. My brother has also had 10 plus years of hassle free satisfaction out of his Mazda’s. Maybe I will try Toyota again in the late future."

Driver and passenger door handles from inside are located in a place where it is hard to close especially for my wife, I have to pull it hard to get it close. Acceleration is good but not very good when you want to pass another vehicle while you are driving 55 - 65 mph even in sports mood.  
Fuel economy is not what I have expected it displays my average mpg 30-31 on console  but the actual mpg is lower around 22-26 combined. I drive it almost 40 miles a day that is 8 miles city and the rest is highway. All in all it seems a good car."
2021-12-22 00:00:00,,"We rented one of these for two weeks when a vehicle was in the shop. We got the AWD because we live in Alaska and this is an AWD SUV, right? We’ve owned Toyotas for years and figured no issues.
Wrong.
We got about 10” of snow one night and this vehicle could not get out of the driveway. It got stuck in the snow in the driveway.
Several issues:
1. AWD is decent for driving down the road in some inclement weather. it is bad when stuck. 4WD would sent power to all 4 wheels. AWD varies the power by what the computer wants to do, not where I want the power to go. This is why it’s good to avoid AWD if you are going to need power to all 4 wheels irrespective of what the computer says.
2. The ground clearance on this is horrible for a vehicle that claims to be an SUV. I can understand if this were a commuter vehicle like a Camry or Maxima or Impala. But this just does not work.
3. The vehicle has NO tow bolts. So we are trying to find a place to attach the tow rope and there is no place to attach it. We wound up using part of the upper engine frame because we had nowhere else to attach the tow rope. And even then, the vehicle could not overcome the amount of snow.,

Takeaway: if you live in Arizona or Texas or Florida where you never get snow, this would likely work. Bit of rain, even torrential rain, and AWD will do you fine for the roads. But if you live in Alaska or Montana or Idaho or Maine where you can get snow, and I mean real snow, not just a dusting here and there, do yourself a favor. Just get a real 4WD SUV with some ground clearance, tow hooks in the front and back, and some decent tires. The time will come when you will thank me."

Understand that we also have a 2021 Venza which is quieter, more luxurious, and gets 39 MPG without blinking an eye. In direct comparison, the RAV4 falls short. Both vehicles are the highest trim and are only about $2500 apart in MSRP."
2021-12-02 00:00:00,,"I have had this RAV4 for a year now.  It is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  This RAV4 replaced a 2010 CRV EXL that I had for over 10 years.  It was a great, reliable vehicle, but this RAV4 way out performs the CRV.  But then this is newer technology also.  The RAV4 has more power, smoother ride with the 2.5L 4 cyl with the 8 speed auto trans (a great combination).  I get great gas mileage, between 33 and 34 mpg on the highway, and between 28 to 29 around town.  I love the AWD and the 19"" wheels.  Being this is my first new vehicle in over 10 years, I love all the new technology and safety features that my old vehicle did not have.  You can get a laundry list of all the great features it has on the Toyota site, so no need to list them all here.  I realize that many new vehicles have similar new technology and safety features, but I really like the styling of the RAV4 and Toyota's reputation of quality and reliability.  So far, I can't find anything wrong with this vehicle.  Being in the Detroit area, I am criticized for not buying one the 'Big 3' vehicles, but I don't work for them, and their quality and reliability can't compare to Toyota as far as I am concerned.  I will put far less money into maintenance with the Toyota and it will last far longer.  You cannot go wrong with this vehicle."
2021-12-02 00:00:00,,"i am surprise at negitive reviews, I am happy with my rav4.  It gets great gas mileage, I am getting 30 mpg combined and after breakin I am expecting alittle better.   I do agree the seats are firm but I have had back surgery and it really isnt a problem for me.  I find the cabin to be super quiet and I do not hear engine noise on the highway.  It is a small suv and I do not expect a Lexus performance.  I am happy with my purchase.  I owned a CRV and had issues with it.  I am hoping that toyota comes through for me with a great reliable suv."
2021-11-30 00:00:00,,So far there is nothing I dislike about it.  I can't imagine that anything is missing from it

2021-11-11 00:00:00,,Love the car but engine is slow on acceleration. Would be nice if they offered nor V6 options.
2021-11-01 00:00:00,,As a senior citizen the electronic are too confusing
2021-10-20 00:00:00,,I had a 2018 Rav4 and other earlier years that I loved. Perfect size and handled nice. Not liking the changes in the 2021. Why do they keep making it bigger ?! I liked the Rav for its smaller size but still being a SUV. Do not like the longer length at all. Also does not handle as well as the 2018. Think ill be looking for something new ( not Toyota) for my next SUV.
2021-04-03 00:00:00,,"We recently purchased a 2021 RAV4 XLE PREMIUM trim for my husband. This SUV is amazing and comfortable, as he is 5’11 and I am 5’9”. The 2.5L engine has a lot of pick me up when needed, which I don’t understand how some are saying this vehicle is underpowered, sure it’s no 8cylinder but it has more than sufficient power for everyday use. It’s very roomy, much more than my new 2021 NX 300 makes me like the RAV4 a little more since it’s also very reasonable in price with all the features it brings. We bought ours with just the features the XLE Premium has to offer with no extra add ons, since this is a commuter vehicle and my husband drives 92 miles a day round trip and a full tank of gas lasts a little over 4 days. That’s amazing for it being a gasoline engine and not a hybrid, which we tend to stay away from for now until that technology is a little more perfected. Overall I definitely recommend this trim level RAV4, oh and it’s assembled in Canada which I know from experience produces amazing quality Toyota models. Test drive one for yourself! We traded in our reliable 2017 Camry SE for this one and don’t regret it one bit! We are a Toyota family for life!!!! 

Update as of 10/05/2021 - We are still in love with our RAV4 and it’s been very reliable after 12,000 miles. Only been at Toyota for regular service and get its oil changed every 5k instead of the 10k for extra protection to the engine. I still highly recommend this vehicle for anyone in the market for a reliable and spacious SUV that gets great gas mileage!"
2021-09-13 00:00:00,,Great HWY and City gas mileage...seeing 32 city and 36 HWY!  Plenty of room!!!  Bigger than previous models. Plenty of power.  Get the faux leather seats on the XLE Premium - def worth it!    Great on road trips and tailgating.

2021-08-22 00:00:00,,"I rented a 2021 Rav4 this past weekend to visit my daughter who owns a 2017 Rav4. The legroom on the 2021's passenger side was bad. The legroom on my daughters Rav4 was 1 or 2 inches better. The 2021's engine shutdown feature when you stop sounded like the engine had bad motor mounts, if it was my car I'd be taking it to the dealer. Even my daughter thought the 2021 looked cheap. I'd steer clear of this model."
2021-08-17 00:00:00,,"I trade my 2021 rav4, at first 4 months you feel it comfortable, but you get through more it get rough, my wife got dizzy in front passenger, and my kids complain at the back, (im drove by the limit) the braking system was getting hard even i press gently, the price was not match to what you paying for, ive been in toyota for my 2 car, now im enjoying another japanese brand, hohohoo"
2024-03-07 00:00:00,,A family member of mine has had this 2022 RAV4 XLE since new ( currently has 27k miles ) and has kept up maintenance. Our local Toyota dealership has steadily declined in quality and recently we heard a loud snap when turning on the re-circulating air feature. Upon inspection it was discovered the cabin air filter box re circulation internal door had split at the hinge. The dealership did not address the issue and a second appointment was needed. The dealer tried to blame this on a few leaves. Which we reminded them were most likely caused by the defective door not closing and allowing leaves in. Something that was missed at each Toyota check. The dealer acknowledged this may have been the cause but refused to cover the repair. Quoting nearly 4k dollars to fix it. Safe to say we will never be using Johnstons Toyota ever again. This design flaw will probably become a recall with the plastic hing being so paper thin. We are severely disappointed in this build quality and will most likely be trading the car in.
2023-02-04 00:00:00,,"I came from having a BMW X1 so it's hard to compare to a Rav4.   I live in Colorado with lots of snow, ice and mountains.   I feel safe in the Rav 4 but have to say I hate the steering!   I've had the alignment checked 2 months after buying the car as it was so bad.  I may end up getting rid of the car in a year for this reason.   The wheels/ rims are the cheapest looking things I've ever seen.   Will probably replace.    I needed a car and the Rav4 was available so I that's why I bought it.   I do like the heated seats and steering wheel, power lift gate and sun roof (all are extras)  And of course, AWD.   UPDATE:   I turned off the Lane Assist and the steering problem is gone/ also got rid of the stock tires.   The car is ok and I see 1000's of them on the road.   It still looks cheap to me with the wheels (I really dislike them but way too expensive to replace for something aesthetic)"
2024-02-06 00:00:00,,I am happy
2022-12-21 00:00:00,,A well thought out vehicle with decent gas mileage and power !
2022-05-13 00:00:00,,"We totaled our 2019 RAV4 a month ago (no one was hurt thanks to all the air bags).   Due to the high cost and demand of used cars and the shortage of new ones, we received almost what we had paid for the 2019 from the insurance pay out.   We were able to purchase a new 2022 RAV4 which turns out to be 100% better than the 2019. Why?…
The 2019 had the automatic engine shut off/turn on when the car stopped at an intersection.   This drove me f*&#@ing crazy.  Apparently so we could save gas.   The new 2022 does not have that ridiculous feature.   
The new 2022 (and older 2019) are both great cars.   The safety features are real, as the ratings from the NTSB or whomever have said.   Lots of airbags.   Both cars have plenty of power and get great gas mileage.   I have owned more than my fair share of new cars and trucks over the years and…This new 2022 RAV4 might be my favorite car of all time, surpassing my previous favorite,  2005 Honda CRV.   
I highly recommend this vehicle, especially if you have a family.   Good luck trying to find one on a lot somewhere.   It took a lot of work."
2023-06-22 00:00:00,,"I sold my 18 year old Rav4 and replace with a gasoline 2022 RAV4 XLE. There is a high pitch noise occurs when the blower fan is on with or without AC/Heater on or off, parked or moving. Motor blower was replaced and same issue. Toyota's employees insist there is no noise other than sound of wind coming out from vent. Show them the recorded noise and they sitll says no high pitch noise. They are going to replace the motor fan again in the next few days. If the noise still persists, I may need to get a third party to verify that aggravating noise. For that price could have bought a different made. No more trust and faith in Toyota."
2023-05-22 00:00:00,,"I just bought this RAV 4 XLE 3 days ago. I'm loving it. It is smooth to drive, power steering is great. Driving up the mountain on a zigzag road was easy and smooth. The AC was perfect. I had it set at 68 degrees. The turns were perfect. Mileage was awesome. It has a lot of features like lane assist, front collision warning, 24 hour SOS, gps tracking, and a lot more. The dashboard cluster looks awesome. It's very spacious inside too. I also purchase the Vehicle recovery for mechanical issues with zero deductible, and other maintenance package. I'm so impressed with the car. I even checked out Toyota Auto Insurance which turned out to be better than my current insurance. So I switched auto Insurance companies."

2023-03-22 00:00:00,,"I had a 2015 rogue for 7 years and loved it. When I went to buy a new one, because of the pandemic, I would have had to wait too long for the car. I ended up buying the RAV 4 and paid $6,000 over the price. I had the car 3 months and every time I stepped on the brake it said battery charging. I didn't realize that it wasn't supposed to say that and one day the car was dead when I tried to start it. They said that something wasn't installed correctly at the factory. They fixed it and gave me a new battery. I have had it back 2 more times because many times when I step on the brake it says battery charging. They tell me nothing is wrong. Also, the seam where the material meets on the steering wheel is starting to separate. The car has 6,000 miles. They said there is nothing they can do because I probably wear too much antibacterial lotion or hand lotion. I haven't worn bacterial lotion since the height of the pandemic and put hand lotion on at night. At the sercie center they actually told me to wear gloves when I drive even in the summer. I hate this car!"
2023-02-13 00:00:00,,"This took a little getting used to. I had a 2018 Rav 4. Traded for 2022 Rav4 XLE. All wheel drive. Heated steering wheel & heated seats. Name brand consistent. That's why I got this Rav. It has sunroof| moonroof. Didn't matter on that to me. The seats are bucket. Would like a less bucket. & more cushion seat. The hatch is great. Adjustable height. Set it to go up as far as u want. There is really leg room for my backseaters & they can lean back. I got the auto headlights. I find the glove box smaller. Nothing will fit but the big book that comes w it. The audio. Bluetooth. Andriod. Apple. Alexa Amazon. No remote start on fob. Radio ,Camera .  There is 2 apps. Or plug it in USB for map.  It's a little tiring. I've watched the videos several times. Read the book. Yes. Got a new phone also. It has to be a smart phone. To get the remote start to work. Not yet. You cannot get your message that was sent to you. The car says pullover to read it. I've learned to like the feel of riding in this Rav. Looks good also. Tires on this one are Dunlop. Drives good in winter.  MN snow, ice, sleet , ect. Only once did I slide. A little sideways in a sloped roundabout. Pure ice. I like the buttons for Eco. & or snow. Also normal or sport. Camera tells you your milage as you go. It has auto windshield wipers. Nice. Lots of safety features. Drive out of a white line , side of road. Nope . You stay in your lane. Other features I haven't even tried yet."
2023-01-28 00:00:00,,"I hardly see a difference between my new 2022 Rav4 and the old 2015 Camry, while driving. I like most of the new safety features, and I like even more that they can be turned off. I wish some of these features could be managed in ""Settings"" and not have to turn them off for every trip.  
Acceleration is worse than my Camry, but this can be resolved by temporarily switching from Normal to Sport mode, e.g. for merging into a different lane in high-speed heavy traffic. 
The main problem I am having now with the car is that I have to rely on only one FOB key, which cost me time and money. The other day my wife needed my car for an appointment. I left the car at home and took an UBER, but I forgot that I don't have a spare key by the door to the garage and my wife missed her appointment. I hope Toyota sends me the second key ASAP, but it may take months.Technology5 out of 5 starsPerformance4 out of 5 starsInterior5 out of 5 starsComfort4 out of 5 starsValue4 out of 5 stars"

Road and wind noise could use some improvement."
2023-01-05 00:00:00,,"I rented a RAV4 2022 for our Christmas break to drive from Texas to Tennessee.
There are a few cons that really need to be fixed. I can only think that the designer must have never driven in his/her design. I am 5'4"" but that has never caused any problems with driving any other vehicles.

The side mirrors are poorly placed- to use the passenger side mirror you have to completely move your eyes away from the road. Sadly you have to do this to see who's on your side, because when you glance back to change lanes the back passenger windows so small you can't see anything without looking to your side mirror. 

The good stuff. We drove up mountains in Tennessee with no difficulty using the Sport mode. It seemed to allow the SUV to ""grip"" the road better. We used the Eco mode while driving the whole way on the freeway with pretty good gas mileage.

I have to say if it wasn't for those side mirrors and the back side windows, I might consider getting a Rav4. Until then, it won't happen."
2022-12-17 00:00:00,,"I have owned a 2012 Fortuner (in another country), 2014 Camry, 2021 Corolla, and 2022 RAV4. Of course, Toyota has its own flaw (Like other) There are a few things I don't like about Toyota car 1. Cabin noise. 2. Interior material. Though, it's not a big of a deal. But I think they could do better. One tip to be advice that if you can find the one with VIN begin with J. You surely got a good quality one. Because that mean it was assembled in Japan. My 2021 Corolla was built in the US. I always notice weird noise in cabin here and there. Which mostly from cheap plastic materials. But my RAV4 was built in Japan. Totally different feel of the interior quality in a positive way. But overall, it's a very reliable and reasonable car. Never disappoint me in term of quality ride. My partner owns a 2021 Audi Q5 so I can compare luxury with my affordable RAV4. Yes, the Q5 overall is superb. It's opposite with the RAV4 in many aspects. But you always feel like you have to baby it. Or it will cost your arms and legs if you didn't buy Audi care that cost $3xxx+ extra from MSRP. Now, I really love my RAV4. My daily commute is just going to work and go home, grocery, gym and a trip out of town once a month. It gave a feeling of trust and could be rely on it in every situation. No matter if you went on a mild off road, a tiny back road or speed up on highway. It has decent power to pass a Semi who's annoyingly drive 60 mph in the passing lane! (Though it's not as quick as Q5) Also, Toyota safety sense works great on the RAV4 that I even feel like its work better than Audi. The seat, I do agree with some reviewer that it doesn't meet a level of ""super"" comfortably. (Especially if you are a big person) But it wasn't that bad for me (I'm 5'5, 165). I would recommend the RAV4 for anyone that want a crossover for a simple daily drive, hauling stuff sometime, few roads trip with family, great mpg, and etc. Who's not too crazy about the perfection. (If you want a perfect ride, smooth, quiet, fast but still want reliable, you might be better off with Lexus). Or if you do off road more often, the 4Runner or Wrangler could be your better choice. At the end of the day, do your research before buying or lease a car is the key."

This car feels like you're sitting in truck seats as far as your position and that is very comfortable because of my back problems. The quality of this vehicle interior is very nice for the price. Gas mileage is great and looks tough on the exterior. Drives and rides extremely well for a small SUV. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a very reliable car that can handle any type of road conditions you may experience.
2022-07-24 00:00:00,,"I was disappointed with the 2018 in one respect, and that was the safety feature of clear vision out passenger side window when checking oncoming traffic.  It had limited vision and was I feeling very vulnerable.  The 2022 rav 4 fixed this issue with making all of the passenger window clear glass and the visual around the side view mirror was much improved…BUT I lost several of the 2018 safety features with the front end and rear end collision warning signals. The sensors in the bumpers were not put into the newer models.  So I’m back to square one with feeling uncomfortable with pedestrian traffic and backing out of parking spaces.  I think I may be moving on to another brand in the future if this isn’t rectified. Too bad..this was Toyota # 12"

Drove the car for a while and did it ever seem small, compared to the 4Runner. However, it was a pleasure to watch the speedometer rise and the fuel gauge stay in place.
The ;eatherette seats were one of the reasons for choosing the ""Premium"" option, as they appear to be very durable, and easier to maintain. A return trip with the car, of almost 300 miles, allowed us to verify the comfort factor. It also allowed the chance to find the design faults from Toyota.
... a very small glove compartment, with a ridiculous tray above it. Storage is a joke!
... the control screen reflects every fingerprint on its face. You have to really study the manual; I miss   .... tuning the radio, without having to search the controls. 
... no CD player.
... TOO MUCH MODERN TECHNOLOGY!
... feels small to drive, but comfortable, once that you figure out the power seat.

The Sienna is very comfortable for both of us, the RAV4 is uncomfortable for me. Both cars have a 12 inch wide center console. This severely limits the lateral space for my legs in the RAV4, but not in the Sienna. I measure the side to side space between the center console and door handle as 24 inches in the Sienna, and 21 inches in the RAV4. My leg has to be in the straight upright position while driving in the RAV4, but not the Sienna. The RAV4 is uncomfortable for me but not my petite wife.I strongly suggest trying the RAV4 on for size before you buy. I find both the passenger and driver seats to be too confining
Additionally the center consoles are much better designed on the Sienna, with 4 drink holders and two slots to hold cell phones upright, compared to 2 drink holders and no cell phone slots on the RAV4. There is a cutout below the console for placing a pocket book in the Sienna, but not the RAV4 The consoles are the same size.
The XLE Sienna comes with moonroof, fake leather seats, power passenger seat, and 17 inch wheels, The XLE premium RAV4 is similar to the XLE trim on the Sienna except it doesn't have power passenger seats, but it has 19 inch wheels.
The RAV4 hybrid drives quite nicely with brisk acceleration, excellent brakes, and doesnt have excessive road nice. It meets the EPA gas mileage numbers Apple Car play integrates nicely. Neither my wife or I were able to get the Toyota Scout GPS navigation app to work, however Waze and Google maps work well with Apple Car Play.

Ok pickup when getting up to speed, ok features. Biggest complaint is on 2nd day of rental, touch screen stopped working. Worked totally fine up until that point. It would show the start-up screen, then go black. This meant 1) no maps 2) no radio 3) the USB appeared to be connected to that and the port wouldn't connect so no apple carplay and thus no apple maps. Phone wouldn't charge using that port - the port in the center console did work thank goodness b/c my phone was running out of battery. When I googled this issue, trying to find a solution, saw many complaints for the 2023 model having this screen issue and not a single solution nor comment that the dealer would make it right. I can't imagine having purchased this vehicle, having the touchscreen die and being told to live with it."
2024-02-15 00:00:00,,"I read all of the other reviews on here about road noise, and I have to be completely honest, this is one of the quietest rides I have ever driven! I had a Bronco Sport prior to this, so perhaps that one was just a tin can and the switch to the RAV4 was an impecable upgrade. Not sure, but I am on my 15th vehicle in 10 years, and I can honestly say it is very smooth (though somewhat stiff, which I like), ride. The RAV4 is roomy, has lots of storage space, and with the seats down, you have a lot of cargo room. 

I bought a slightly pre-owned 2023 RAV4 LE, so it is the base model (I believe), but it has all the bells and whistles I could need. Heated seats, wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto), blind side detectors on the mirrors, signal indicators on the rear of the side mirrors for traffic to see, it has a very powerful engine (which is bigger than my Bronco Sport, which very much surprised me). It has really good pep to get up to speed on the highway. It does feel like the SUV sits a bit low to the ground compared to what I previously had, but no complains. It also handles really well in the ice and snow - coming from Northern Saskatchewan, Canada, where our temperatures fluctuate between 0 and -45 in the winter lol. 

My only complains is that it is a flip key, and no remote start comes standard. It also is not eligible for the remote controls on the app to control the locks, windows, etc. This was a free service with remote start on the app for my Bronco Sport, so I was quite saddened to see that Toyota charges $9 a month to even get access to a status update as to if your doors are locked and the fuel level...but you cannot control the door locks from the app on the LE, just be forewarned about that. 

The ECO driving mode is quite nice, and I barely notice a difference when it is turned on. The fuel mileage is quite good, but driving in the winter when I have to warm up the car, it has guzzled a bit of gas in the last two week, so I won't comment on the exact MPG haha. 

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and have no regrets. The resale value on the RAV4's is exceptionally high, even after 5 years, and that heavily influenced my decision to purchase this over a CR-V."
2024-01-29 00:00:00,,"First off, I do not own a '23 Rav4, but I rented one and spent 12 hours of mixed driving in it.  I went into this happy I'd get a chance to drive the Rav because it has been on my short list of vehicles I'm considering, but it isn't any longer.
First, what I liked.  The climate controls were excellent.  Simple buttons and large, rubberized knobs.  And it put out heat like a champ.  The shifting lever felt solid and was intuitive to use. Cargo space is excellent, as is fit and finish.  The LED headlights were more than bright enough and the Auto-High Beam feature worked as expected.  Highway passing was good, the turning radius was more than acceptable for a medium-sized SUV and fuel economy was better than most cars that are 10 or more years older.
What I didn't like: It's loud.  Really.  I have rented many cars, and I own a 2003 Matrix (which is really loud), but the RAV4 let in more road noise than any vehicle I've experienced aside from my own (and if you've driven a Matrix you don't expect noise insulation anyway). If you have the radio on at any real volume it will be difficult to talk with your road mates unless you raise your voice more than you'd like.  The transmission is not as refined as it should be (I've heard the Hybrid model is better) and the auto start/stop system was jarringly noticeable. The Adaptive Cruise Control is not subtle at all.  When the coast is clear it floors the accelerator and when it needs to slow it often abruptly brakes when easing off the gas would be just fine.  And the seats, after more than three hours, start to feel hard.  I also didn't like that my right leg was up always up against the console, and I'm only 5' 8"".  The audio quality of the entertainment system wasn't that great either (but perhaps that's adjustable in some buried menu?).
In short, I was disappointed, and for a vehicle that is hard to get into for under $31K, I would expect Toyota to have spread around a bit more sound insulation and used a more refined transmission.  That is why when I begin to look in a few months I'll be starting with a CR-V, Tuscon and Sportage.  And that saddens me because I love Toyota's reliability."
2024-01-12 00:00:00,,"poor acceleration, transmission whines, noisy and uncomfortable front seat and hard to enter without bumping your head.  Vision blocked by rear view mirror and forget about the media center, awful to use.  Most popular car in US Why???"
2024-01-08 00:00:00,,"After I already spending almost 40k, these jokers have the audacity to bug you for 15/month to make an ad go away. An ad that shows EVERY single time you turn the car on. Not cool at all. I will be buying a different branded car."
2024-01-04 00:00:00,,I love my Toyota bought it brand new ever since I bought it I smell antifreeze there's no leak anywhere but I smell antifreeze I took it to the dealer they seem to not find anything wrong they don't smell the antifreeze I smell it anyone having the same issue with the antifreeze smell
2024-01-04 00:00:00,,"- The noise in the cabin is mind-numbing. It's so loud you can't hear the turn signals sound.
- The car play sucks. It does not connect to the USB. Always error. Turns off unexpectedly. Black screen. Randomly activates the microphone function. Crazy.
- Door panels at night only illuminate the button on the pilot window. So, if you have to change the side mirrors or open the locks at night, you will do it by touching or turning on the interior light. There is no way you can see the buttons.
- The USB port is placed in a spot you can only see during the day. If you want to plug something in, you can only use the cell phone light because not even the interior lighting reaches this part of the dashboard.
- The fuel meter on the dashboard is semicircular and located on the upper right side. The steering wheel obstructs the indicator, so I have to look for it and remember to check the gas because there is no quick view of something important.
There is something called a man-machine interface, and it seems that whoever designed this model doesn't know about it.
It's a total disappointment. I made a 3-year lease with high quotas, intending to buy it. I'm counting the days until the lease expires and I change the car. It's a nightmare."
2023-12-18 00:00:00,,"Big disappointment!  Had all the bells and whistles but still looked like a cheaper car.  Bumped our heads every time we got in, and we’re averaging size people.

2023-12-17 00:00:00,,"With both of us having Prius's (7 over all), I thought I would buy a Hybrid Rav4 (3rd one) AWD XL Premium.  For the most part a decent car.  Great acceleration, reasonably good gas mileage (hit 54mpg, not often, consistently 42).  Handles well, comfortable ride, but ya got to ask how cheap can T be?  
1.  The preset seat button, only controls the seat posiition, would have been nice to include the mirrors as well.  
2.  Heating system could use some improvement in volume of hot air pushed thru the dash.  
3.  The thickness of paint appears to be exceptionally thin.... hair thin.  
4.  What really is a problem?  After spending just under $50k, you have go to subscribe for dash based gps.   Really?  That friggin cheap?  Yea.  
Overall we have purchased 13/14 Toyotas, from Camry, to FJ, to Prius, to Rav4.... sell a good product and people come back..... but  corporate penny pinching seems to work at driving customers away.    This may be the last T we buy."
2023-12-05 00:00:00,,"I recently rented one for a 1,200 mile trip.  While I have never liked the styling, I was hoping for a competent small SUV.  Instead I found almost nothing to like and lots that was actually bad.  Maybe some things would have been better in a higher end version
Worst were the seats.  While I could get the seat in a comfortable position, there was a support bar that hit my back in totally the wrong position.  After the 3rd day of driving my back was shot. There was no side bolstering but that may have been fixed in a higher trim level. My passenger did not have this problem and found the seats comfortable, so maybe it was just a bad seat.
Toyota generally has a good reputation for their finish.  The RAV4 was full of cheap plastic with lots of pieces that did not line up correctly. Most of the controls did not light up so they were hard to find at night.
The car had problems climbing hills.  It has to downshift a couple of gears and I really had to give it a lot of gas for the speed not to drop a lot.
For a ""compact suv"" you sit very high which makes it harder to get into and to load. Some people may like this.
The ride was both rough and floaty.  Needless to say there was nothing fun about driving it.
The lane assist was terrible.  It kept over correcting so it ended up bouncing from side to side in the lane.
There was a LOT of road noise.  MAYBE better tires would have helped.  But noise in general was higher than I was hoping/expecting.
I had CarPlay issues.  While the info center always saw my phone, occasionally car play would not start. The base system installed was about the worst I have seen in a car for a long time.  
Controls were pretty intuitive with large real knobs for HVAC speed and temperature.
Gas mileage is pretty good for a small SUV.  On a 1,200 drive with lots of mountains and highway driving it averaged about 32 mpg."
2023-12-03 00:00:00,,"Suddenly, after owning a 2023 RAV 4 XLE for four months, it has died three times in a week in the garage. The dealership told us that we don’t run the car far enough and long enough and that we have to drive it longer and more often to keep the battery charged. We were told that there is nothing they can do for us unless we change our driving habits. We have been Toyota owners for decades and have never heard such ridiculous excuses for an undependable car. We would like to hear if others are having the same issue. We will never buy or lease another Toyota!"
2023-11-06 00:00:00,,"I recently purchased a 2023 RAV4 Hybrid and love the car in general.  That said, I have one major complaint.  Shortly after purchasing the vehicle, I was using my iPhone connected to the Multi-media screen through CarPlay, when the iPhone maps app disappeared and I got a splash screen saying “Experience Toyota Drive Connect.”  There was no way to exit this screen apart from pulling over and restarting the car and reconnecting the iPhone.  I googled this issue and saw various possible solutions, but none worked.  I called Toyota and after multiple delays, was told that the only way to get rid of this screen is to purchase a subscription to “Go Anywhere” which includes Drive Connect and Remote Connect.  The cost is $15 per month, plus whatever tax you pay in your locale.  While Go Anywhere has some nice features, it should be an option, not a mandated purchase to utilize CarPlay.  It seems to me that this is essentially extortion, forcing owners to purchase a subscription in order to use CarPlay.  This is beneath the high standards of Toyota.  I’m sure that Toyota could disable this splashscreen easily should they so desire."
2023-11-04 00:00:00,,"It’s not great but not bad either. The engine is underpowered by at least 50 HP. It gets 34 mpg but dogs up the hills. It offers a fairly smooth ride, steering is responsive, and breaks just fine. It does most everything well. The most frustrating thing about this vehicle is that it has no heated mirrors. I live in the North-East and winters are bad. I have a heated steering wheel but my mirrors are iced over; how backwards is this company. I wanted something more reliable than my old VW Passat TDI and I got it. I just wish they spent a little more time refining their product in the real world not just on paper."
2023-10-22 00:00:00,,Really like the smooth solid ride.  We have a 2021 and the 2023 has larger cup holders which is an Improvement. I’m not bothered by any road noise. Con: It would be nice if these new cars were more solid it does feel body wise like an aluminum can but all cars have switched to cheaper lighter materials. The steering wheel is not thick/wide enough like on my sequoia. Bring back real bumpers on all vehicles
2023-10-15 00:00:00,,"Had this vehicle a just over a month … I’ve a 2017 and 2019 Tacoma, 2013 Camry and 2014 rav4… I’m pretty impressed …  

My tacoma was costing me $80-90 to fill a tank and filling 2 sometimes 3 times a week.. currently the rav4 is only costing me $45 which to me is amazing..

Reading the other reviews the engine is little loud but that’s with new technology and not worrying about carbon build up due to the port injection.. if the noise is that big a deal buy a hybrid or there is radio and you can still talk to people ..

Im 510 227 lbs, wide built guy, and I sit comfortably.. no issues for me.. love having power seats again.. heated seats, heated steering wheel and the heated windshield or w/e, cant wait to try this winter if it snows in boston.. 

There is an auto shut off button and yes it’s annoying shutting off but that’s comes with the territory and almost all cars have it now.. so have to get used to it..

It’s a small suv that’s purpose to seat a family comfortably, comfortable ride, be reliable and have efficient power and gas mileage.. it’s not perfect but what car is? 

I don’t like how you have to buy a package go get a sunroof, older models in this body style were equipped differently but sh*t happens 

Overall I’m very happy and everyone who drives in it likes it and comments on the space and ride .."
2023-10-13 00:00:00,,"I love everything about this car. Gets great mileage, very roomy, smooth ride"
2023-10-08 00:00:00,,"I had this vehicle as a rental while my 2014 VW Passat was having body work done after an unfortunate incident with a basketball hoop. Thank god it was only a rental , even though this RAV4 was brand new with only 14,000 miles on it it was so LOUD in the cabin and making noises you shouldn’t be hearing in a brand new car. The interior is unimpressive and uncomfortable. I’m 5’4” and 130 lbs and even I thought the front was bordering on claustrophobic, I didn’t like how high the seat had me sitting either , even with the seat on the lowest setting. The acceleration is non existent , and again very loud. The ride in this was comparable to a soap box derby car . A stark difference from my VW that is quieter , more comfortable,smoother and quick , even at almost 10 years old . 

In conclusion, not a chance I’d buy this vehicle. Ever."
2023-10-03 00:00:00,,Didn’t like the cabin space or the stingy standard equipment.

2023-09-27 00:00:00,,Liked the overall vehicle.  Liked the touchscreen infotainment system and the instrument panel.  Only issue was the smaller steering wheel than I’m used to.  Other than that I’m cool

2023-08-27 00:00:00,,"After driving many competitive SUVs , settled on the RAV4. Solid feel of city  and highway driving, as I spend lot of work & leisure time in my vehicles. My sales work made easier with mobile showroom easy access cargo area with customers( sits on comfortable level to load, access, move items around.)Mpg is great. Thought I’d miss my Ford Edge , that I loved, but I don’t. This RAV is easy to love. Nicely conservative styled , crisp lines, yet not showboat machine ( which I didn’t want). Anticipating years of use. Wife finds it easy to climb in/out , it’s “ butt height” friendly ! 😊 And we ain’t spring chickens , folks , in our late 60s !"
2023-08-17 00:00:00,,We are thrilled with our new car! We look forward to it lasting another decade or more
2023-08-07 00:00:00,,"I Honestly did not like this car at the beginning because of the price I ended up paying since it was my first time in the country dealing with a dealer (Always be prepared to negotiate and know what to negotiate with them). 

With that said, since the moment I did the test drive I really like it, good power nothing mind blowing but good enough to overtake cars in the highways with confidence. 

Interior built although feels dated as usually for Toyota ( that is why I feel that this car will be always be 4/5 starts), feels solid, simple and with good quality. 


Funny to see everyone complaining about the start/stop functionality, but there is a button Infront of your face to deactivate that. People just don't read manuals or try to understand the car functionalities. 

I just drove it 2500 miles across the US with around 1100 lbs of cargo since I was moving out of state, and it performed perfectly. Incredibly with that cargo, I had an average of 29.5 mpg/g throughout the entire trip. 

You do feel that you have a very high-quality car that will last...."
2023-08-02 00:00:00,,"Very comfortable, easy and soft to drive"
2023-07-14 00:00:00,,"Purchased a 2023 Rav 4 LE recently and very pleased so far. It's a smooth ride, great steering, not too concerned about acceleration( had a turbo before this and don't miss it), it goes enough for me. I'm hoping this vehicle lasts longer than my Honda CRV did before I started having problems after only 3 years and 24k miles. I don't hear too much about recalls on Toyota vehicles like I have about Honda. I will update if I have issues in the future, but for now I would recommend the Rav 4."
2023-06-24 00:00:00,,"Let me start by saying that at almost every time I’m parking, my RAV4 shuts on and off 4 times: 1) when I press the breaks to stop first, 2) when I reverse and press the break again to stop, 3) when I press the break to finally park the car, and 4) then when I shift from D to P (it turns on again, and you press the button to turn off the car). Ridiculously sensitive auto shut off, doesn’t even give you a second and a half of wait before shutting it off, as soon as you press it, it immediately turns off. Additionally, the breakpoint to whether you’re pressing lightly to avoid shutting off or not is very sensitive too, for you to press the breaks and not have it shut off on you, is like a 3 milimetre window, if you press just a LITTLE more outside this little window, it turns off, so it’s almost humanly impossible to manage and get used to not pressing a little bit more and making it shut off when you’re parking or maneuvering- in other words, when you stop the car and DO NOT want it to shut off on you. There is a button to turn off the “auto-shut off”, BUT, I DOT NOT want to be pressing the button to turn off the auto shut off every time I enter the car, I cannot really remember to do that at every time I start the car. So, it’s ridiculous that it’s a nice car but has a such a small but very annoying detail that makes you lose interest in the car just because of that. Believe me, your engine is not made to be shutting on and off 4 time sequentially and so frequently. It makes me feel sick to realize this is decreasing the lifespan of the car that I paid so much for. Also, to add another weird thing about those auto shut off system - once it is turn off and will turn on when you get you feet off the brakes, it’s kind of a rough start, you feel the car propelling itself forward. I’ve driven other cars (cheaper) that have a much smoother system. For some reason, when you press the button turn the car on, it’s not a rough start (no propelling feeling), but when it turned back on from the auto shut off, if you feel it propelled your body forward."

2023-06-23 00:00:00,,"I have had my new '23 rav4 for 5+ weeks now.  Overall, it's acceptable.   My biggest complaint is the level of road noise I hear while driving.  I had read other reviews from owners about this exact issue.  I should have taken it seriously.   Would I purchase this rav4 again after experiencing the noise for myself....?.... probably not.  Kinda sad, considering it's a beautiful car, but I expected much better for a ""new"" vehicle.    pretty  vs  function ?
I'm already considering what and when I will get my next vehicle because of this issue.
Toyota.... listen"
2023-06-01 00:00:00,,"Test drove on smooth Hwy only which was a mistake. On typical roads horrendous cabin noise, rattles in headliner where there feels like no insulation. Headrests rattle probably because of the 19” tires on that litl puppy. I’m not exaggerating to say it was difficult to have a conversation or hear music unless you were riding on a newly paved road. It could easily be pushed in on the sides making it seem like a “tin can”…sharp looking budget friendly (gas mileage) small crossover but noisy cabin, rough ride and seemed to be sub standard materials used EXCEPT for the Michelin 19” tires. Wasn’t the vehicle for me."
2023-04-29 00:00:00,,"We've been Toyota buyers for years and have always been very happy with them.  Until we bought a new 2023 RAV4 Limited.  It's pretty, and we like the driver safety features, like Blind Spot Monitoring and Lane Departure warnings, etc. But it has a rather rough ride, and the engine noise is bothersome.  But far and away the worst feature is both the Multi-Media display and the Multi-Information Display.  Both are so difficult and confusing to use, even after hours of studying the owners manuals, that we've mostly given up trying to use them.  We try to never attempt to change any settings because we can't do that without a great deal of difficulty and are many times unsuccessful to boot.  We've owned it for a few weeks now and I'd gladly undo this purchase. My love affair with Toyota is over."
2023-03-30 00:00:00,,"CONS: Uncomfortable seats. Unless you are small, they are VERY tight. Front passenger seat sits up to high, you will bang your head trying to get in this poor design body / head room area. Driving visibility is poor compared to other SUV's in is class size. The outside mirrors still shack when you drive down to road. Road noise is still to loud in this vehicle (NO new Improvements).  Only built for 4 Persons NOT 5 too small NOT comfortable on trips. The engine is still LOUD and is always searching for which gear to be in. Back seats are VERY tight for any desist leg room. Dealers are Always marking the vehicle up an extra few 1000's more WHY? Shop around or walk away, DO NOT PAY the extra bogus fees. Make sure you get all of the items listed due to the fact your vehicle may not come with everything due to material shortages. I have own 3-Toyota's and the quality has gone down hill. Also if you do order a Toyota, an it comes with a 2 year maintenance package; DO NOT WAIT FOR 10,000 miles for them to change your fist oil/filter change, this is bad you would be wise to change it at 2,500 to 5,000 to remove any contaminants left form the factory.  The only pro: Good gas mileage."
2023-03-27 00:00:00,,"Since 1985 I've had the pleasure of owning 10 Toyota vehicles for myself and various other family members.  The RAV4 XLE continues in that tradition of reliable quality and solid performance that I've come to expect from my Toyota vehicles.  
Purchase is for a young couple with a baby on the way.  RAV4 is the perfect size for both drivers, has plenty of rear-seat room for baby seats and has LOC/tiedowns on all three seat points in the back.  
Power liftgate is perfect for an expectant mother.  Gas mileage is solid, 200hp 4 cylinder provides plenty of pickup.  STAR-safety features (especially the laser cruise control and blind spot indicating mirrors) will pay for themselves.
My only complaint?  Toyota seems to be purposely limiting supply, giving dealers way too much leverage on price (we probably paid $3-4k too much and still had to wait weeks) but it's not just Toyota shutting down production, we had to wait for an equivalent Honda as well, and Hyundai/Kia were out until they fixed their security issues.  
Overall, not a great experience, but a vehicle that was worth waiting for, if a bit too expensive."
2023-03-02 00:00:00,,Great suv.  Bigger than the 2018
2023-02-24 00:00:00,,If you’re driving in the very uncomfortable front seat looking at the LCD display from 50 years ago with numb steering and deplorable handling. This car isn’t horrible. Soon as you put people in the back you realize you’re in a convertible. You can’t hear anything. This car feels and sounds like his was made from recycled aluminum pans And the transmission will not shift properly. The engine is so under powered but they had to replace the motor due to manufacturing problems. This is my first and last Toyota never again horrible experience.
2023-02-23 00:00:00,,We could see some improvements on 2023 RAV4 (we had the 2019 RAV4.) We truly love it! We really need more time to study the multimedia manual in order to use the display fluently.

2023-01-28 00:00:00,,"On Day six of ownership and 171 miles my new 2023 RAV4 LE began to whine when turning a corner from a full stop. It sounded like metal scrapping and whining. By 200 miles the brakes began to hiss. At this point I began to document via video the brake and steering issues. Dealer evaluated and  “fixed” the issue by saying they bent the backing plate on the braking system so it would no longer rub up against the rotor. Since the backing plate typically supports the entire braking system of rotors, calipers, brake pads, brake lines and attaches to the wheel hub this is more than a quality control issue in my opinion.  The hissing brakes returned after I got off a long freeway drive home from the dealership. If I could give Zero stars for the RAV4, I would."

2023-01-05 00:00:00,,"Generally a decent car, but didn't buy it for the following factors. Cargo volume too small to pass the ""load a mountain bike with the seats flat"" test. Buzzy engine note. Styling that tries a little too hard. Worthy, reliable but left with the feeling that that the people who drive these really don't like cars that much and want to make a safe choice while remaining oblivious to the finer points."
